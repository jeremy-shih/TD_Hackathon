My name is Yolanda and I'll be your operator for today' call. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. All lines are in listen-only mode. Our speakers will address your question at the end of the presentation during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Catherine Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust's third quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our third quarter earnings release and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents as well as our supplemental financial information package are available on our website, www.vno.com under the Investor Relations section. In these documents and during today's call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release Form 10-Q and financial supplements.","Please be aware the statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commissions including our Form 10-K for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. This call may include time sensitive information that maybe accurate only as of today's date. The company does not undertake the duty to update any forward-looking statements.","On the call today from management for our opening comments are Steven Roth, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; David Greenbaum, President of the New York Division; Mitchell Schear, President of the Washington, D.C. Division; and Stephen Theriot, Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room are Michael Franco, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer; and Joseph Macnow, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's third quarter call.","Business in New York continues to be terrific, really terrific. We are enjoying robust demand from all matter of tenants, led by financial services and creatives in all of our submarkets and at record rents which are now 25% higher than expiring rents. Ditto for our largest and best-in-class Manhattan Street retail business, where we recently signed the blockbuster 64,000 square foot and 60 meter lease with Victoria\u2019s Secret at 640 Fifth Avenue.","Our Fifth Avenue portfolio now includes Victoria\u2019s Secret, the Swatch Group for its luxury brands including Harry Winston, Uniclov, Polyester, Feragamo, MAC Cosmetics, Massimo Dutti and Cop [ph] Shop. We are brilliantly positioned on Fifth Avenue and our Madison Avenue, Time Square, Soho, Penn Plaza and in Union Square as well.","Our Street retail strategy is the focus on the very highest traffic locations. We will lead the commodity product even in Manhattan to others. Our efforts in Penn Plaza continue to gain momentum, the temporary closure of 33rd Street earned rave reviews with luxurious [ph] paper calling the Plaza an oasis in Midtown. Penn Plaza is our Big Kahuna.","220 Central Park South continues to perform at record breaking levels. As we have said Washington has bottomed and is starting to come back in fact that is now the consensus view. As Steve Theriot will tell you shortly we are revising our EBITDA guidance for Washington for the full 2015 year to be behind last year by $3.5 million. We have previously projected Washington\u2019s EBITDA to be flat.","In Chicago, we completed an important 15 year lease with ConAgra for 168,000 square feet at the Mart. This space will become ConAgra\u2019s new Corporate Headquarters. This execution continues to validate our value creation strategy for the 3.6 million square foot iconic property at the bull\u2019s eye of Chicago\u2019s Rover North submarket.","On the acquisitions front, we have been and continue to be very selective. In July, we acquired 260 11th Avenue, a 235,000 square foot office property lease to the City of New York through 2021 together with the continuous 10,000 square foot parking lot and additional airlines. This 44,000 square foot site is located at 11th Avenue from 26th Street to 27th Street directly across from the Starrett Lehigh building.","With 260 11th Avenue, 85 10th Avenue, 61 9th Avenue and, 512 West 22nd Street we will be one of the largest owners in the employment and supply constraint West Chelsea Office market. As I have said before rents across all submarkets in Manhattan are converging and we expect rents in these buildings to be on a par with traditional Midtown submarkets to the north.","As the dispositions, in October we entered into an agreement to sell our leasehold interest in 20 Broad Street. The property is contiguous to the New York Stock Exchange who is also the major tenant occupying 80% of the building as expected the modern day New York Stock Exchange did not meet to renew this lease. Accordingly we sold our leasehold to a residential converter. The aggregate consideration for the sale of the leasehold and the nine-month early termination of the New York Stock Exchange leases $200 million or $423 per square foot.","Total income from this transaction is approximately a $156 million. The sale is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. In September, we completed the sale of 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue North West, a 278,000 square foot office building in Washington D.C. for a $182 million or $650 per square foot. This resulted in a financial statement gain of a $102 million.","The tax gain was deferred as part of a lifetime exchange for the acquisition of the Old Baby Store on 34th Street in the middle of Penn Plaza. We are managing 1750 Penn on behalf of the new owner.","In August, we sold our 50% interest in the Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, New Jersey to our joint venture partner at a value of $229 million, proceeds to us with 38 million and resulted in a financial statement gain of 33 million in the third quarter. With this disposition we have essentially completed our exit of the mall and strip shopping center business.","As for operations, we had a very strong third quarter, and I'm very pleased with our financial results. Our third quarter comparable FFO was $1.24 per share, 14.8% higher than last year's third quarter.","As Steve Theriot will tell you shortly, excluding income in last year's third quarter from asset sales and excluding income from mark-to-market fair value adjustments of our real estate funds both of which really shouldn't be included in FFO. Comparable FFO per share essentially that of our core business would have increased a whopping 23%.","Company-wide in the quarter we leased 1,459,000 square feet in 125 transactions. In Manhattan we leased 509,000 square feet of office space with positive mark-to-market of 25.4% GAAP and 24.7% cash.","Let me leave you with one final thought about the franchise value of our business. Vornado and its management team are one of only a very small handful of firms who have the track record, have talent, relationships and trust in the marketplace to lease, acquire, develop, finance and manage million square foot towers and Fifth Avenue retail. It's a complicated business. Rookies need not apply.","Now, I will turn it over to Steve Theriot to cover our financial results.","Stephen Theriot","Thank you, Steve. Yesterday we reported third quarter comparable FFO of $1.24 per share, up from $8 per share in the prior year third quarter, a very strong 14.8% increase. Our core performance is clouded by the inclusion of gains from asset sales and mark-to-market fair value adjustments of our real estate fund without which our comparable FFO would have increased 23%. Not surprising, most of the 23% of growth comes from our very strong New York business.","Total FFO for the third quarter was $1.25 per share compared to $1.15 per share in the prior year third quarter. Non-comparable FFO items in the quarter are income of a scan $949,000 or a penny per share compared to income of 13.2 million or $0.07 per share for the third quarter of last year. Please see our press release or the overview of MD&A on page 38 of Form 10-Q for a detailed summary of non-comparable items.","Third quarter comparable EBITDA was 392.2 million ahead of last year\u2019s third quarter by 7.8%. Excluding the effects of the fund our comparable EBITDA increased by 12.2%. Our New York business produced 282.4 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter ahead of last year's third quarter about 13.7 million or 15.4% driven by the redeveloped properties coming back into services primarily 7 West 34th Street, 330 West 34th and Marriott Marquis retail space at 1535 Broadway and acquisitions primarily the Regis retail 150 West 34th Street and the Center Building.","Our Washington business produced 78.7 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, behind last year's third quarter about 3.4 million. As Steve said earlier, we have revised our Washington EBITDA guidance and expected Washington's comparable EBITDA for the full year 2015 will be approximately 3.5 million or 1.1% less than 2014. The decline from 2014 comes equally from lower occupancy of skyline and lower lease termination fee income.","Now turning to capital market. In July we completed 580 million refinancing of 100 West 33rd Street, the 1.1 million square-foot property comprised of 851,000 square feet of office space and 256,000 square-foot Manhattan mall. The loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.65% and matures in July 2020. We realized net proceeds here up 242 million.","In September, we up-sized the loan on our 220 Central Park South development project by 350 million to 950 million. The interest rate in the loan is now LIBOR plus 200 basis points and the final maturity is in 2020. In connection with the upsizing we terminated a much more expensive 500 million standby mezzanine loan commitment and paid the 15 million contractual termination fee.","A few days ago we entered into a senior unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility in the maximum amount of $750 million. The facility matures in October 2018 with two one-year extension options. The interest rate on the facility is LIBOR plus 115 basis points with the fee of 20 basis points per annum on the unused portion. At closing we drew a $187.5 million.","With this term loan facility and the upsizing of our 220 Central Parks South development loan we have the funds in place to complete the construction of 220 Central Parks South and our Bartlett Residential Complex in Pentagon City. This $750 million facility in an addition to our $2.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facilities.","As of today, we have $3.5 billion in liquidity comprised of $1 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $2.5 billion undrawn on our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. You will note that we do not include the $750 million new term loan facility in our liquidity facility, because this facility is matched to fund our 220 Central Park South development and will self-liquidate with the proceeds of the condominium sales. We expect to reach our $2 billion cash target by year end.","Our debt-to-enterprise value is 35.4% excluding the financing for our 220 Central Park South condominium development project, our total debt-to-EBITDA is 7.1 times and our fixed rate debt accounted for 79% of consolidated debt with the weighted average rate of 4.34% and a weighted average term of 4.9 years. Our floating rate debt accounted for 21% of consolidated debt with the weighted average rate of 2.01% and a weighted average term of 5.5 years.","I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business.","David Greenbaum","Steve, thank you and good morning to all.","We continue to be very constructive on the New York marketplace. Manhattan closed the third quarter once again with positive absorption, higher asking rents and declining availability rates. At 9.7% Manhattan availability is now at the lowest level since the third quarter of 2008 more than 300 basis points below the great recession high of 12.8%.","Importantly in New York we continue to experience strong employment growth for office using tenants with the U.S.-Euro of labor statistics projecting 33,400 new office using jobs for 2015 and a similar number of jobs for 2016. As I said on last quarter's call, in addition to the continuing employment growth in the TAMI, Technology, Advertising, Media and Information sector, which has been driving economic growth for several use now. The FIRE tenant\u2019s financial services, Insurance and Real Estate recently have become very active in the leasing market. We now have dual engines driving the strong job growth in the city.","Turning now to our own portfolio. In the third quarter we completed 43 office leasing transactions totaling 509,000 square feet at an average starting rent of $79.80. This continues our strong leasing trends year-to-date. 1,666,000 square feet of total leasing activity year-to-date at very robust average starting rents of $80.09. Our mark-to-markets for the third quarter with 25.4% GAAP and 24.7% cash. As expected, and as I have discussed on our last two calls, our third quarter occupancy dipped slightly by 40 basis points to 96.2% reflecting space that we got back at Eighth Seventh Avenue as well as the exploration of the STWB space at 90 Park Avenue.","At 90 Park Avenue, our redevelopment program is near in completion and in the third quarter we've completed two leases in the mid-rise of the building with the rent starting in the mid-80s. Taking account of both our redevelopment program at 90 Park as well as the strength in the current marketplace, these rents are sum $25 a foot higher than just two years ago. At Eighth Seventh Avenue, we got back five floors in the tower, a total of 100,000 square feet and we have already leased two of the floors at rents over $100 per square foot with mark-to-markets of 35%. With the world of wash and liquidity, business for the New York based boutique financial service firms is booming.","In the third quarter, we signed a total of seven leases aggregating 69,000 square feet and starting rents over $100 per square foot. In fact year-to-date 24% of our total leasing activity 400,000 square feet out of the 1.7 million square foot leased has been in average starting rents of $108 per square foot, a total of 19 leases in six of our Trophy buildings. 650 Madison Avenue, Eighth Seventh Avenue, 350 Park Avenue, 280 Park Avenue, 640 Fifth Avenue and 770 Broadway.","Turning now to our street retail business. In the third quarter, we completed four retail leases, at 640 Fifth Avenue we elected not to renew H&M when their lease expired in January of this year and to maintain the cash flow at the property we immediately broaden a TAMI tenant for the space. We searched for the right tenant for this iconic location on Fifth Avenue at 61st Street and in September we signed a 16 year lease with Victoria's Secret for 64,000 square foot flagship at 640 Fifth Avenue. The store which is expected to open in November 2016 will have 78 Feet joint Fifth Avenue and 9,350 square feet on the grade with three selling levels and additional storage and support space. The mark-to-market on a lease is a 196% GAAP a 3 multiple and 130% cash a 2.3 multiple.","Importantly we also retained the stores on 3200 square feet with 25 feet frontage which we current are in the market to lease. With the additional lease up this store the combined GAAP mark-to-market on the entire space will be over a 3.5 multiple.","On our last call I discussed the two record breaking leases we completed with the Swatch Group for its luxury brand including Harry Winston at our premier St. Regis retail property on Fifth Avenue at 55th Street. The in place with Bottega Veneta and the bears were schedule to expire in 2016 and 2019.","Since the last call we have accelerated the timing of Swatch delivery by moving Bottega Veneta to a temporary store at 650 Madison Avenue and entering into an early termination agreement with the bears. Think about it between the two Swatch Group lease at the St. Regis and now our flagship deal with Victoria's Secret at 640 Fifth Avenue. We have completed all three major leases on prime upper Fifth Avenue this year truly a testament to be extraordinary quality of our Street retail assets and our leasing team.","Excluding the Hotel Pennsylvania, our same store numbers for the New York business for the third quarter are tapped positive 2.2% GAAP and 0.5% cash and not reflective of the real growth in our operating results. Last quarter there was some negative comments on the same store results. So let us spend a minute and talk about it.","This year\u2019s same store results reflect both a dip in occupancy in our New York office port to 96.2% as well as the retail space at 640 Fifth Avenue which we will not be delivering to Victoria's Secret until next year and the space we recently took back from Crate & Barrel at 650 Madison Avenue. This year\u2019s real growth has come from placing a redevelopment properties 7 West 34 Street, 330 West 34th Street, 280 Park Avenue and 1535 Broadway back into service. However, that real growth is not a component of our same store results for reporting purposes.","Historically we have been an industry leader in same store results and we fully expect to be back there next year with high single-digit same store numbers. Let me just say all is good in our New York business. Comparable EBITDA of our New York business is up $37.7 million, up 15.4% this year over last year\u2019s third quarter.","Let me now turn the Mart at the epicenter of the River North market in Chicago where we had a tremendous quarter leasing 398,000 square feet of office space with mark-to-markets of 47.4% GAAP and 34.8% cash.","The highlights for the quarter include a 15 year lease with ConAgra Foods for 168,000 square feet which will be relocating its corporate headquarters to the Mart from Omaha, Nebraska. Other significant leasing in the quarter included a 45,000 square foot lease with another Fortune 100 company moving to downtown Chicago from the Suburbs.","A 72,000 square foot expansion with Yelp bringing at total occupancy in the building to over 130,000 square feet and a 41,000 square feet expansion with the prominent technology incubator 1871 bringing its occupancy to a total of 118,000 square feet.","I want to pause from moment here and focus on the Mart.","Just a few years ago, we embarked upon a program to re-imagine this iconic asset. At the time, the 3.5 million square foot building was predominantly an industry building with showrooms and trade shows occupying over 70% of the building. What makes the building so attractive to office users is its unique and huge footprint of 200,000 square feet per floor.","To give you some perspective here, each floor is over 4.5 acres. In July, 2012 we signed the Motorola mobility Google lease for 600,000 square feet which required us to downsize or relocate over 140 showroom tenants to produce the contiguous space. We have since added PayPal, Yelp, Matter, a bioscience incubator two expansions with 1871 and now this quarter ConAgra and another Fortune 100 company.","Today, the building measures 3.65 million square feet and the showroom industry which originally occupied 70% of the building has been downsized to just over 40% of the space. The remaining four showroom industries are healthy and high performing. The contract furnishings industry with the Acon trade show, the home furnishing industry, casual and outdoor furniture and Lux Home the Kitchen and Bath industry.","We have taken the EBITDA of this iconic asset from just over $50 million a few years ago to $80 million next year with plenty of room to grow. Our internal budget takes the EBITDA of the asset to triple digits over the next couple of years.","If you\u2019re in Chicago, our team would love to take you on the tour to building to showcase both our innovative tenant spaces as well as the next step in the reinvention of the Mart which is now in construction. A grand stair with stadium tenants to congregate including a presentation venue which brings new life to the first two floors of the building as well as trend setting food options and a re-imagine food hall. The state-of-the-art amenities add to the Mart\u2019s attraction to all class of tenants, the tech guys as well as corporate America.","In San Francisco at our 1.8 million square foot 555 California Street property, we completed three leases in the third quarter for a total of 45,000 square feet including two market leading leases at approximately $100 per square foot starting rents and 18,000 square foot relocation with the financial services tenant and a 23,000 square foot renewal and expansion with the mobile video game company for the entire 52nd floor.","I will conclude my remarks where I began. We are very, very constructive on the New York marketplace. Our pipeline of office and retail leases is robust, we continue to realize very strong mark-to-markets and the acceptance of our redevelopment projects by both the brokerage and the tenant community has been nothing short of spectacular.","Thank you. And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mitchell.","Mitchell Schear","Thank you David and good morning everyone.","In Washington, the economic recovery is on solid footing and most indicators are trending positive. The unemployment rate is 4.3% which is down from 5.3% a year ago and below the national average of 5.1%.","According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics 53,300 jobs were added between September 2014 and September 2015 with the vast majority driven by the private sector and over 20,000 of these jobs were in office using professional services. A positive indicator for office space demand and absorption.","The brokerage report headlines are also expressing confidence about the D.C. office market. The headline of JLL's third quarter report on DC REITs, broad based recovery taking hold across the region. The report goes onto say that as of the end of the third quarter, Crystal City lead all D.C. submarkets in terms of overall gains.","Most of the absorption sighted in JLL's report is Vornado space. Notwithstanding an improved order of absorption we continue to see higher than normal vacancies in the Washington office market that will take time to absorb before we gain real traction but the consensus is that Washington is bottomed out and is indeed now in recovery mode.","Within our Washington portfolio in the quarter, we leased 449,000 square feet of office and retail space in 61 transactions bringing our year-to-date total leasing to 1,642,000 square feet in 172 transactions.","In Q3, we completed several notable transactions in downtown Washington. We completed the sale of 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue to 278,000 square foot mid-block office building for $182 million recognizing the gain of approximately $102 million. Over the past few years through effective repositioning and releasing we had maximized the value of this asset. This was the right time to sell and recycle our capital. We continue to manage the building on behalf of the new owners. We signed the 58,000 square foot lease with the U.S. Treasuries Office of Inspector General at the Bowen Building at 875 15th Street. Through this transaction we resolved most of an upcoming vacancy well ahead of the current tenant lease exploration.","We also completed a 26,000 square foot lease expansion at 21 Owen L Street with the commercial brokerage firm DTZ to support their recent merger with Cushman & Wakefield. Our building has become Cushman & Wakefield's Washington headquarters where they now leased the total of 59,000 square feet.","As an aside we also own Cushman & Wakefield's New York headquarters at 1290 Avenue of the America. And we're finishing up a leased expansion which we work for an additional 39,000 square feet to accommodate their continuing growth at 1875 Connecticut Avenue including this space they will now lease a 122,000 square feet on three floors.","At the end of Q3, our overall downtown D.C. portfolio with 11 buildings and about 3.2 million square feet is well leased at 93% occupied. Also in DC we are moving full speed ahead with our new 335,000 square foot state-of-the-art Trophy office building at 1700M where we planned to harvest value from within our existing portfolio. We are now vacating in this spring we will demolish two obsolete buildings to make way for our new freestanding corner building in the heart of the central business district. Construction of the new 1700M building will begin in the second quarter of 2016 and we expect to deliver in late 2018.","In Crystal City, we continue to make steady progress. In the third quarter, we completed a 194,000 square feet of office leases and thus far for the year we have signed over 1 million square feet in Crystal City. Our office occupancy in Crystal City is now 89.2% up 400 basis points so far this year. We continue to add our creative community through new tenants and destination amenities that appeals especially to our growing urban Millennial demographic.","In September, we signed a 16,500 square foot lease with 5Q [ph] a company that supports Federal government innovation by connecting defense agencies to new tech companies who utilizing predictive analytics and other high-tech solutions. Earth Treks is opening a popular new indoor rock climbing concept that combines adventure sports with fitness classes, with 35,000 square feet of climbing surface. The new facility will be in the top three or four on the East Cast in terms of climbing wall size. And last week Global Startup incubator and seed fund 1776 celebrated the grand opening of their new campus in Crystal city with a weeklong series of events and workshops. Joined 100 of entrepreneurs, corporate innovators, political officials and thought leaders. Their focus in Crystal City is on connecting their extensive startup community to agencies and major corporations especially in areas of defense, aerospace and cyber.","Our third quarter TI's and leasing commissions were 13.5% of initial rents or $6.12 per square foot per annum which is consistent with market conditions. For Q3 2015 versus Q3 2014 we reported same store EBITDA of negative 4.5% on a GAAP basis and negative 9.4% on a cash basis.","Overall occupancy, including residential and Skyline was down 10 basis points from Q2 to 84.7%, but up 150 basis points from Q3 2014. Office occupancy, including Skyline, was down 20 basis points from Q2 to 82.2%, but up 200 basis points from Q3 2014. All of our occupancy numbers have been restated to reflect the sale of 1715 Pennsylvania Avenue which dinged our office occupancy numbers by about 30 basis points given its high occupancy on sale of 97.4%.","Our office occupancy in Crystal City is now 89.2% of 400 basis points so far this year. Skylines occupancy is now 51% down from Q2 53.5% and obvious continuing drag on our overall performance. Without Skyline our overall occupancy including residential is now 91.2% up 210 basis points from Q3 2014 and our office occupancy without Skyline is 89.8% up 290 basis points. On the residential side we own 2400 apartments in Georgetown and Arlington with the third quarter occupancy of 95.3%.","In total we own 15.4 million square feet of existing and developable footage in Crystal City and Pentagon City. A huge swath of value creating opportunity on the shores of the Potomac. Our team is in high gear on several key development projects. Our new 699 units bought little apartment projects and whole foods is topped off and on track to be delivered in mid-2016 and we will begin preleasing and marketing early next year.","Now, towering above all of the neighboring building at 23 stories it's already a Skyline maker. At the very beginning of 2016 we will open WeWorks new innovative residential concept in Crystal City. We have re-purposed and obsolete office building to include more than 200 new collaborative living community style apartments as well as two floors of WeWork space. WeWork will add an important layer to the Crystal City fabric and we are excited to welcome them here.","Elsewhere in Crystal City we have filed for approvals for the redevelopment of the building that will be vacated by the U.S. marshals. We branded a 1770 Crystal drive, this is a 270,000 square-foot prime building in a bulls eye location that we recaptured by moving the U.S. Marshals down the street to our recent lease.","This was a strategic move to generate more value from the re-positioning of an existing older assets, located on Crystal drive right at the metro, the building will go out of service next year as we improve it with a new skin, new lobby, new systems and new spaces for delivery at the end of 2017.","In addition 1770 crystal drive will be surrounded by new destination restaurants and entertainment all heightening the urban experience of crystal city. We have tremendous value in DC that will be unlocked by really seeing our vacant space as well as harvesting a robust development pipeline.","Thank you and I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Manny Korchman from Citi. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes good morning it's Michael Billerman [ph] here with Manny. Steve I'm just curious on the $2 billion cash target I think of the first time I actually heard it refers to the target. I assume that takes the $1 billion today adds the 750 loan the 20 broad sales. And I just curious as I you think about the $2 billion target, 6% of your gross asset value $10 a share about 10% of your stock price. How should we think about that, is that something that you want to just keep as a standing balance is that something do you want to use whether you're going to use it. How should we think about getting to a $2 billion cash target?","Steven Roth","Hi Michael. So I mean our history of managing this business has always been to be highly liquid to take advantage of opportunities and value in the marketplace. We have said before multiple times over the course of recent history that we think that the easy money has been made we think that pricing assets in the marketplace are high. We're not calling it top we're not saying that they're not going to go high, but clearly and the interesting inflection point in terms of value. We also said that we believe that for a company of our size it's prudent to have a large cash reserves and a large liquidity reserves to take advantage of opportunities. and so what we're doing is we're I think I said at last quarters, two quarters ago, this is the time when the smart guys go to cash, start building cash rather. And I think the couple of by Brethren [ph] in the industry jumped on top of that and said while GI agree with that. so our strategy so our financial strategy is to be highly liquid and to increase our liquidity as the market and that just give higher so that we're prepared for the other size of that amount. And that's basically what we're doing.","Unidentified Analyst","Is there anything...","Joseph Macnow","Michael its Joe I think you said that that $2 billion include the $750 million it does not and it includes a $187 million we borrowed but it does not include the balance.","Unidentified Analyst","So what makes up the differential than between two and adding 20 - for 200 and the 187 what makes up the differential?","Joseph Macnow","Financings and other things that are in process now. That hopefully will be completed year end.","Unidentified Analyst","Any sales or that just financings.","Joseph Macnow","Yes and yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Joseph Macnow","Thanks Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks Steve I was hoping if you could just comment on the progress that 220 Central Park South. I know the disclosure changed a little bit in the 10-Q and I was just hoping you could update on the sales activity there.","Steven Roth","Sure, let me talk a little bit about 220 Central Park South. Last quarter we disclosed fair amount of competitive information about sales progress et cetera. We did that not to establish a disclosure policy but in recognition of the fact that our accountants determined that we have to recognize the deferred tax asset and recognize that the income last quarter and it was a fairly sizable number and the reason for that mores our spectacular progress in sales. So 220 and therefore that will be highly likely that the deferred tax asset would be --. So the disclosure last quarter was interesting and important but not necessarily a policy. So having said that let me give you a little news just away we are now. The 220 Central Park South project continues to be premier market leading development in the super luxury class we're up to the 9 floor in construction. We've sold more than 50% I think the number is accurately in the 53% or 54% of our projected sell out.","Our margins are superb and are holding with each sale. And so that\u2019s that we had sold 14 units about $50 million as price points, several of which are much higher price points, record breaking price points.","Interesting enough and this is new information this is not a home to offshore slight capital 45% of the buyers are New Yorkers for their principle residents and other 30 odd percent totaling 70% are Americans living in other cities other than New York.","Now let\u2019s talk about the product itself, by design the product is intended to be the best project that has ever been delivered, the course of the project are on a sellable square foot basis, $5000 a foot, so it\u2019s costing us $5000 a foot to manufacture this asset. This has been sellable foot basis, $1500 a foot is land and $3500 a foot is in hard and soft and financial course that other than land course.","The quality of the product is shown by a couple of statistics for example the building has the largest loss factor of any building of its type intentionally so that the amenity packages and what have you are extraordinary and are too cadent in this marketplace. The size of the amenity package and what have you in the lobbies and multiple lobbies and multiple buildings in the motor and the garage and all the rest of it in the pools and the rest of the amenity package, so there\u2019s a double whammy. Number one, the square footage has to be build and number two is the cost of those items is obviously multiples of what basically in empty apartment close.","So that\u2019s the update we continue to be beyond thrilled with the performance of this asset, it continues to be the market leader and those are the facts.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thank you for that the detail. I guess maybe one for David Greenbaum. I can appreciate your comments about the strength of the market and maybe the small financial service - you've obviously seen some large I guess restructure is going on at places like Deutsche Bank and Barclays, new CEO is coming in you also had some lay off at some other larger investment banks I'm just curious as those companies continue to shrink and deal with Dodd Frank and other regulatory issues can the market continue to work and do you expect that those companies to perhaps get back space to the market over the next couple of years?","David Greenbaum","Yeah since the great recession obviously we\u2019ve seen Steve no growth by what you're referring is the big bold banks. And certainly it\u2019s not my expectation that we\u2019re going to see any significant growth there. I do believe that a lot of these banks already have gone through significant downsizing\/rightsizings so do I expect that the banks are going to be giving back significant space going forward? I think the space they\u2019re giving back to the extent they are going to relocate and move to a new corporate headquarters that space may well be in the context of new efficiencies in the marketplace in the way people are utilizing the space differently. But for the banks that are in place we\u2019re certainly not seeing any significant space impacts by those institutions.","Steven Roth","Steve think about it this way, the New York, the Manhattan office market is thriving okay if I was more promotional which I'm not I would say it was on fire or whatever. The New York market place is thriving, it\u2019s extremely constructive. And it is doing that and growing based upon tech, media, all different financial services, excluding the bracket banks. It's the bulge were doing great even though that segment of the market place which has traditionally been the market leader has now become the market follower, okay.","If you can imagine three, four, five years from now if that what happened to turn, what might happen to Manhattan so all that I'm saying is we\u2019re doing fine without the big bolds bracket financials growing.","Now from our point of view we have intentionally structured the mix of our portfolio if you go through our asset with asset-by-asset around that. So we do not have the input banks in our portfolio intentionally [ph].","And so if you look at our portfolio, we are - our prime targets and customers are the smaller boutique financials, the tech guys, the media guys, the retailing guys other kinds of things. So, we\u2019re actually very constructive had notwithstanding your appropriate comments about the big banks staying in place we\u2019ve been shrinking. And we\u2019re also very pleased with where we are to asset-by-asset in our portfolio.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Thank you. I was hoping we could stick with Mitchell and talk a little bit about the depths of the recovery we\u2019re seeing in D.C. or coming off the bottom? So, you've quoted JLL saying we are recovered but maybe talk more about what submarkets are seeing the most demand and what the leasing pipeline looks like and we\u2019re hearing that GSA is starting to get a little bit more active and as it the law firms?","Joseph Macnow","Could you provide more color?","Steven Roth","Sure. So, I think what we\u2019re seeing as I said as JLL said the issues that we struggled with over the prior couple of years have worked themselves through the systems and we\u2019re pointing in the right direction. How steep the slope is or will be I think it's impossible to predict this point. We\u2019re still seeing the kind of vacancies and competition for spaces but we\u2019re starting to see green chutes and as you said, you see some activity from the government, we\u2019ve got a two year budget deal in place that kind of budget deal ends up giving us a certainty in the marketplace for people to move and I think that we\u2019re cycling through some of the contractions that we\u2019ve seen both from the government and the contractor side as a matter of fact we're starting to see some contractor growth in different segments not just in defense but in other areas as well.","So, in terms of specific submarkets I think what you\u2019re going to continue to see is downtown will probably outperform the close in metro centric submarkets like Crystal City in [indiscernible] quarter, we\u2019ll start to pick up and we\u2019ll probably outperform some of the other markets as well.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Can you quantify that depth of the leasing demand and tenants out there?","Steven Roth","I don\u2019t think you can really specifically put any quantities of numbers I think that at the end of the day if you\u2019re going to see positive absorption it simply means that we\u2019re obviously filling more seats than that are been vacated and exactly how fast and how quickly that\u2019s going to go I think it\u2019s really impossible to predict.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Alright, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Antony Paolone from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Antony Paolone","Alright, thanks. Just on the D.C. market you gave us the high single-digits same store results for New York next year. Can you maybe give us some color on that for DC given and everything you just said in that kind of bringing down this year little bit?","Steven Roth","As has been our policy for the last three years I guess, we have given guidance on what we expect Washington performance to be, we will not release that guidance until our fourth quarter call in February.","Antony Paolone","Okay. And then on the balance sheet if you look at to the rest of this year you\u2019ve got some perhaps that to be called the next year you got 1 billion worth of debt then you talked about this $2 billion of cash you want to run with. Can you maybe tie together what\u2019s your plan to do with perhaps and that next year given our high cash balance and how that ties the other?","Steven Roth","Say the question again please.","Antony Paolone","I am just trying to get, I think if you\u2019re going to have $2 billion of cash and you\u2019ve got debt next year coming due, it seems like above market rates and some perhaps that become callable later this year. Can you give a sense as to what\u2019s your, how your plan on either taking those out or refinancing them or what you want to do there on the balance sheet?","Steven Roth","Next year's maturities our $318 million on Eighth Seventh Avenue which is in the market to refinance now. 770 Broadway by the way this Eighth Seventh Avenue finance mode is 5.7% rate that's in the market to be refinance now but obviously a substantially lower rate. 770 Broadway we have $353 million that comes due next year at 5.65% that's in the market to be refinance now again at a very substantially lower rate. There is a 6.14% financing on both on the Bowen Building in Washington for $150 million that will be refinanced again at a substantially lower rate. And the granddaddy of all is a $550 million loan at 5.57% on the merchandise mark. That will be refinanced at a much lower rate and with a much higher proceeds. So all of those, probably three quarters of loans that I've just read off the spreadsheet are in the market to be finance now. Each of them represents earnings improvement opportunities because the rates are legacy rates that will be substantially improve the park.","Antony Paolone","And is the excess cash is that's what getting you to the $2 billion.","Steven Roth","We expect that there will be a fair amount of excess cash. In addition okay, we have not financed the St. Regis which was a very large $700 million purchase and were in the market finance that now and to try the very attractive rates as well as Seventh West 34 Street, the Amazon building which is - which will be financed. So our balance sheet is beyond liquid has extraordinarily high levels of unfinanced assets. And so we are and then that's the keeping of our balance sheet in this condition liquid and it was important to understand. So we think we are in grand shape.","Antony Paolone","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Great, okay. Couple of questions. So just had a curiosity it like your total incremental budget on 220 Central Park South went up $300 million which is $630 on the sale per square footage and $630 on a zone square footage and about $730 on a saleable square footage. Any idea what cause it to go up of that magnitude? Is that build out allowances or something.","Steven Roth","No the answer is three things. A, most of it is catch up and that catching up the budget which we probably should have done three months ago or whatever longer which we didn't. So a lot of it is just catch this is the first thing. The second thing a lot of it is misbudgeting a lot of it is expansion of the program adding cost which is we're delivering more product than a product higher finishes et cetera. And the last is that the construction market in New York is inflating aggressively and cost are rising. And even more important than that is there is there are enormous number of cranes in the sky. There is which are exceeding the capacity of the construction industry to deliver services. So there are handful of contractors who are expert in each traits and they those guys are running out of capacity. So there is a bidding premium to get timely delivery of products and services.","John Guinee","Got it. Okay. And then Mitchell for you...","Steven Roth","Hopefully at reason.","John Guinee","Okay. Mitchell, it looks to us if the GSA is going to be freeing up or in the mark with a lot of RFPs. The bad news is it's all about price and the bad news as its most usually a space contraction but the good news is there will be a lot of velocity which should serve Crystal City well do you have any sense for the magnitude of the RRPs that are going to come out in the next two or three years beyond obviously TSA, department of justice, marshals, national park service et cetera. Is it a million square feet year or is it 3 million square feet year of RRPs that come out from the GSA?","Steven Roth","The amount of GSA expires plus the amount of GSA leases that are either in short term basis or in holdover is a pretty significant number and you'll see over the next two to three to four years a tremendous amount of the GSA activity. How much of it translate as you say into relocation, we really do not have very many explorations of GSA in our own portfolio over that five year period. So it really leaved us in a favorable position to absorb some of those requirements will take a look at them I think you are going to see many of them in 50,000 square feet range and as you said it's as compared to wholesale agency relocation. But I do think that goes well in terms of our strategic location or GSA in crystal city in particular.","John Guinee","It's significant over a three to five year period in total, a million square feet or 20 million square feet?","Steven Roth","No, you are seeing multiple, multiple millions of rollovers, how many of those translate into relocation is another story. But you are looking in no single million but in multiple millions, 5 million and 10 million.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Bejjani from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","John Bejjani","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, I'm sure you saw the large portfolio sale on special dividend equity res announced recently and the markets positive response the news. I know you said you are happy owning all the assets in your portfolio right now. But given the discount asset value of Vornado stock. Any thoughts regarding larger scale dispositions today?","Steven Roth","John, I don't think that something we can get into this.","John Bejjani","Okay.","Steven Roth","I think the following as a philosophy. I think we have shown over the last number of years that we are really not work to anything that we really are simplifying and restructuring the business along product lines, exiting certain businesses, we've sold or spun or disposed that $8.5 billion of assets over the last very short period of time and really I think simplify to our business and clarify our core business and strengthen it.","As we go through our assets I think what Sam did was basically he had old pot of assets that he didn't want and so he was taking a strategic decision that he was going to focus in urban highlight in the coastal markets. So we've sort of done that already. So we don't have a large strategic imperative in front of us.","Having said that from time-to-time we do sell assets and in fact we have in the market place right now a New York asset that happens to be 7 West 34th Street that we think we've done our job, we bought the only assets for somewhere in the low hundreds of millions single-digit hundreds of millions of dollars. I think that $500 million is more than that or 500 million in the 500 certainly.","So anyway so we do have that asset in the market place to harvest value. So those are examples. I think we're strategically we are in pretty good shape maybe even very good shape. We think about what you mentioned all the time and we just don't have any announcements to make now.","John Bejjani","Okay. Thanks for that. David, quick just clarifying question on the 640 Fifth Avenue lease. I think you said in the cash releasing spread of a bit over 100%. I think Steve previously mentioned the possibility of quadrupling rent there, obviously retail rents moved relatively previously thought you'd achieve or is this delta just the comparability issue?","Steven Roth","I think David in his remark. I'll hand it out and David can counter punch. David in his remark said that the mark-to-markets for the Victoria lease and Victoria\u2019s Secret lease was X that we retain 25 footer adjacent to it, which is a part of the asset. When you lease that and we\u2019re in the market place to lease that now obviously the two of them combined will result in a 3.5 X multiple of the previous tenants rent. So while that\u2019s not four multiple I apologize to that but 3.5 is pretty dam good and so that\u2019s do you have anything David.","David Greenbaum","No that\u2019s exactly right as you look at the combined leasing of the entire space and we can retain extraordinarily prime store right next to Victoria\u2019s Secret.","John Bejjani","Okay great that\u2019s helpful and David just one last question you site us that on the leasing contribution of TAMI tenants in the New York market can you give us a sense of your office portfolio and leasing demand is coming from TAMI versus FIRE today?","Steven Roth","So if you across the city, TAMI is actually generating city-wide today in the probably low 30, 34 or 35% of total leasing velocity as compared to what I call the traditional fire sector which was and has been kind of the mid-20% range. We\u2019ve seen the fire sector become more active this year city-wide again what I call the boutique financial services firms a number of deals which obviously we have done in our own portfolio fiduciary truck, harvest partners, medley capital, a number of other deals.","I think as we look at demand in our portfolio today we\u2019re seeing in all sectors I will tell you we\u2019re seeing some extraordinary situations where we have two TAMI tenants, two tech tenants both of which effectively are looking to grow in one of our buildings where somehow I wish I could take the building and add another million square feet to it. So we really are seeing very strong growth as Steve said, very constructive in the kind of tenants that are attracted to our portfolio generally around the market place.","John Bejjani","Alright, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Your line is open.","Ross Nussbaum","Hey, good morning everyone. Steve I'm curious back in the doldrums late August early September when the stock was around 85 why did Vornado like not to repurchase shares at that level I'm assuming it was well below what you saw the companies were at?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is we prefer to keep the liquidity and not lever up our balance sheet or the marginal increase in per share value that could be created by a stock buyback so the stock is 85 and so you have to pay a premium if you want to buy anything in size and if you split that over in the remaining shares the numbers doesn\u2019t move the needle. And I think of most probably team was asked the similar question yesterday the day before and gave a similar answer.","Ross Nussbaum","Okay.","Steven Roth","That doesn\u2019t make - right by the way.","Ross Nussbaum","No, it helps to understand your thinking.","Steven Roth","If you go back to my letter to shareholders this year, I think it was this year, there was an extensive section not only on street retail and not only comparing the increases in market rents for office by submarket and retail by submarket in Manhattan, there was an extensive section on share issuance and share buybacks and what have you. And I think in there I said that if you go back to the early days we did the largest capturing buyback in the history of the New York Stock Exchange we bought back 65% of the company when the stock was selling at huge 50%, 40% of what it was worth. So if you use a billion dollars of liquidity to buy back stock in one of these big companies and you pick up $0.40 or $0.50 a share it was, it's my judgment and the judgment of our board that the use of that liquidity and return to that marginal uptick in NAV or per share value is not sufficient when you may very well be at the wrong time of the cycle to sync your liquidity.","Ross Nussbaum","Got it appreciate that. If I can go back to 220 Central Park sale for a minute in the 10-Q because one of this quarter three from a billion in 2Q can you just comment on what drove that 300 million sequential increase and then separately just comment a little about what we should be expecting or may be assuming for a kind of all in tax rate on your gains given what happened with the deferred tax asset last quarter?","Steven Roth","I think I answered that exact question about what happened with the $300 million for John Guinee two seconds ago. Basically it\u2019s I think I answered.","Ross Nussbaum","I thought you were talking about another asset. Okay.","Steven Roth","No, no I was talking about that. Okay what the tax rate is going to be?","Stephen Theriot","It\u2019s complicated, very complicated. The TRS that the condo is in has tax NOLs federal tax NOLs that\u2019s what generated a deferred tax assets we talked about. So FTU met those and you have intercompany charges supplementing the actual course of construction, the tax rate is going to be 15%.","Ross Nussbaum","15, 15?","Stephen Theriot","15.","Steven Roth","So you think 15% on a 100%.","Stephen Theriot","50% on gain.","Steven Roth","100% on gain. So let me supplemental slide to that, if you take the gain which is X and we\u2019re not going to predict what the gain is okay but if you pick the gain of X it will be divided into three or four different buckets. One bucket is there are most carry forwards which will protect the certain portion of the gain so that has a tax rate of zero although from an opportunity pause point of view you\u2019re using up an NOL. Then there are other parts of the gain which basically are affected by inter-company transactions and charges so that will also reduce the gain by X in that.","The remaining gain will be fully taxed at corporate tax rates of what are you 35% and so what Joe is doing on the fly is he\u2019s saying if you take 35% that\u2019s sort of like a 100%, a 15% or something basically like that and that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to also give a complicated answer to a complicated question.","Ross Nussbaum","Okay. I\u2019ll try to ask a kind of simple one, do you have any - this is actually not a simple question 660, at what point do you think you\u2019re going to be able to talk definitely to the market about some of the plans of the press reporting in terms of the retail mall with hotel and condo?","Steven Roth","We don\u2019t know, basically 660 Avenue go take a drive and take a look, I mean it\u2019s a magnificent asset brilliantly located on Fifth Avenue right in the heart of Fifth Avenue it\u2019s a full block probably it\u2019s a massive asset. It\u2019s - we own Vornado owns a 100% of the retail from each except for this [indiscernible] which that owns and 50% of the office building together with a joint venture partner. It\u2019s truly obvious that the dirt to the ground unencumbered would be worth more than the building is worth.","And so and that the highest and best use for this property if it was not an office it was not encumbered by a building would be a series of mix uses which are different than what exist there now. And so the profit shift is trying to figure all that out understand what our options are and understand what the optimum business plan for that is.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Peterson from Sandler O\u2019Neil. Your line is open.","Ryan Peterson","Sorry, I meant to remove myself from the queue I'm all set, thank you.","Steven Roth","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brad Burke","Hey good morning guys. Just another one on 220 Central Park South in terms of the timing. Looks like you have over $1 billion left to spend. And I think you're still targeting completion by the end of next year and just seems like a lot of capital to get out the door particularly when you look at how much you've been deploying over the last couple quarters. So wanted to get an update on what we should be thinking about in terms of timing and whether there is a risk that we might see the timing slipped.","Steven Roth","Well the timing is not going to slip, your timing is a little bit too early. This is - there is a two and a quarter years left to go.","Brad Burke","Two and a quarter until completion.","Steven Roth","Two and quarter from now to completion.","Brad Burke","Got it, okay. And then just on --.","Steven Roth","Brad just go back for a minute. So just let me restate again our financing plans for that asset. We had a $600 million project specific loan from Bank of China around the asset. We upsized that and reduce the interest rate by the way to 200 basis points over LIBOR we upsized that by $350 million to $950 million. We then had we have a range some time ago a $500 million mez loan which was at an interest rate of hovering just close to double-digits. So it's expensive. And which is the appropriate rate in the marketplace.","We've replaced that paid a contractual $15 million termination fee because it wasn't a standby mez loan and then we've replaced that with an almost special purpose term bank loan facility. Now that term bank loan is in addition to what get a two whole $5 billion of revolvers which are currently undrawn. And that we described that term bank loan as a delayed drawn term bank loan and we've never seen that those to anywhere. So we saw them we invented them. And the reason we invented them was so that you also understand that we will take that money down overtime as we needed to build the 220.","And so the way we look upon this that $750 million piece of finance is in addition to our regular balance sheet and is basically directed at the financing of 220 Central Park South and the Broadway down in the Northern Virginia. So that's our capital plan and we've obviously brought our cost of capital down very significantly by doing all that.","Brad Burke","Okay, that's helpful and actually is a segue to my next question just thinking about total floating rate debt exposure. You're up about over $1 billion from last year and to your point that will probably increases you will continue to fund your construction at 220. But then you also have a lot of refinancing activity coming up. So I was just hoping for an update on how you're thinking about your total level of floating rate debt of what you think is at a total appropriate level.","Steven Roth","The answer is I don't know that we have any guideline we understand that people like the certainty of fixed rate debt. I can tell you that fixed rate debt is as risky as floating rate debt maybe even more risky. Because it's a much more expensive and B it has lockout so that it has large penalties if you want to pay it off. And so we believe my personal feeling is that interest rates will be lower from longer. I've been making that call for a year\u2019s ad years although I'm not an economist it is not my job to make that call. My job is to protect our balance sheet and our company and you all and so we think we do that. So we have a very low level of debt.","We have a huge massive amount of liquidity. And so we feel that we can handle easily 20% floating rate debt in our capital structure and what have you. And so we don't do that. Basically the most important part of our balance sheet statistics is the debt level. The second most important part of our balance sheet metrics is the liquidity level the third most important is the mix of floating to by the way third most important is our line of maturities and then the lost is the floating rate statistics mix.","Joseph Macnow","And Brad one of the things you want to think about as it relates to the fix in floating is, we look at the financing related to the 220 project as we match to that project because it\u2019s going to liquidated from the sale of the condos and so what I gave our liquidity statistics, we back out the 220 financing and doing those statistics and we think that\u2019s the best way to look at our capital structure.","Brad Burke","Sure. I mean you would still have the exposure to higher floating rates over the next two in the quarter\u2019s years I suppose?","Joseph Macnow","Correct.","Operator","And our next question comes from Derek Van Dijkum from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. It\u2019s actually Ian Wiseman [ph] with Derek. Just a quick question on the Penn Station submarket you picked up another asset on 34 street I think you have the corner now on the Eighth Avenue maybe you could just talk about plans for that site overtime and maybe just give us an idea on broader or master plan for Penn Station overall. Thank you.","Steven Roth","As we've said many times the Penn Station market, the Penn Plaza marketplaces the Big Kahuna we have a very large investment there, we invested early, we have a huge profit already on our investment in the very, very large numbers and so we\u2019re very pleased with where we are.","The timing of this submarket is perfect now, the perfect storm whereas the Penn Plaza was always the cheapest submarket in Manhattan and [indiscernible] still is. The confluence of the events surrounding Penn Plaza is nothing sure of extraordinary and validate our investment strategy and so I have said before the islands of Manhattan is changing to the west and changing to the south and I think that\u2019s now become to consensus view.","I\u2019ve also said that the submarkets the pricing of office space in the various submarkets is flattening meaning its conversing, meaning that the higher ARPU from the Plaza district being the highest rent down and working lower as you go south is starting to evaporate and [indiscernible] rents are in Chelsea and as well as on Park Avenue.","So, we think that the opportunity both for retail and even more for office in the Penn Plaza district is extraordinary and so by the way we\u2019re full now, we\u2019ve been full there every months for the last 15 years what\u2019s so highest rents we\u2019re getting now in Penn Plaza David?","David Greenbaum","Mid 60s.","Steven Roth","So, rents are creeping up from low 50s to mid-50s to at the top bracket in the mid-60s. And so our job there is to improve our building, improve the streetscape, improve the food offerings, improve the retail offerings and most of all improve the physical plans of our office buildings so that the market rents in those in this market can climb to similar to where it is in the surrounding submarkets which could easily be in $20 or even $30 a foot higher so that\u2019s our objective and we\u2019re busy working on that we have nothing specific to announce now but we hope to before too long.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Steven Roth","Recently. There is one more thing upside keep going on this. Recently, we just completed a three month\u2019s trial where we closed together with the prominent transportation and the city of New York officials, we close pretty extraordinary when you think about it thinking the easterly half of 33rd Street and turn to get into a public plaza and taking the western half of 33rd Street and putting it into service for both our 2.5 main building on one side of Madison square garden and the other. So that was the very successful closure. We look forward to become permanent next year and so we\u2019re offer running.","Unidentified Analyst","That\u2019s helpful. And this is my follow-up question. Just thought on a potential or possible spend of the D.C. portfolio all our urban edge?","Steven Roth","We have nothing to report on that. Although we have not and I said this in my letter, we have not eliminated any possibility everything continues to be on the table.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you very much.","Steven Roth","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao","Good afternoon everyone or good morning, sorry. Just curious we talked a lot about the TAMI tenants and in New York City and I was just curious you had a lease in San Francisco that you did in the quarter. Just any notable change in discussions there tech tender in San Francisco?","Steven Roth","Listen there has been a lot of chatter in the marketplace that with some BC capital potentially drawing up and the IPO marketplace not being as open as it was that we're seeing some pull back in terms of the tech tenancy and the San Francisco market. Our own experience has been that while there has been a lot of chatter and discussion about this we're still seeing very good vibrancy in the marketplace.","We are doing some work right now at the adjacent building to 555 California complex, the 315 Montgomery and 345 Montgomery building's which we think are very attractive to the tech types of tenancy and again we are seeing very good growth in the marketplace their rents in San Francisco have been going up at a clip of around 10% or even higher on an annual basis over the less number of years, seeing good growth and good demand.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thanks for that. And just a question on investment and your buildup of liquidity. I know we've been talking about that for quite a long time. Just being the right time to build some cash here. But just curious if there has been any notable early warning signs now something that's changed in the markets from your perspective or if it's just still consistent with the what you've been talking about for the last several quarters.","Steven Roth","Trees don't grow it in the sky and pricing has - the easy money clearly been made, pricing is very aggressive, I don't know which way interest rates are going but people think that they are going up. I don't know which way cap rates are going but 50% they can't go much lower. So it seems that this is the time to begin to think about prepared for the next cycle. If you are in a position like we are running company like ours and you don't stop thinking like that you are not being responsible.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sumit Sharma [ph] form Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thank you so much for taking my question. Vance send his apology as he is not able to attend. So a quick question about the Mart I guess we are 60% almost or slightly above for the office mix up from 50% last year and I was wondering and I think you once mentioned that soft goal of about over 60% of office mix. I was wondering if there is any room for greater office mix beyond this point or the stage or I guess what are the said differently what are the other avenues for harvesting value in that property.","David Greenbaum","Our target as we said in the past has been to transform these assets so that the mix of the building today is about 60% office, as I said earlier in my remarks the remaining showroom tenancies in the building are high performing businesses that today are healthy vibrant and pay rents in showroom building where tenants generally to be congregated within a building within a class of showrooms is going to be paying premium rents. So today I will tell you we think that mix that we are trying to get to of about 60% feels right to the extent the businesses are dislocated in the future similar to what we saw in giftware business with that business basically was changed by reason obviously internet electronics will obviously be able to capitalize on that.","The other piece of the building I will say is there is a number of what I referred to his old office tenants in the building still with very low rents where we see the ability to significantly to capitalize on those tenancies as they come up and bring in what we will refer to as higher tenancies whether it's Corporate America coming from the outside or TAMI types of tenancies go attracted to the unique fore place to the unique building.","Steven Roth","So when you think about the Mart building, its enormous I mean its 3.6 million square feet net ratable that those numbers is over 4 million square feet. So it's an enormous asset it has these unbelievably unique and in high demand 200,000 square foot - place. It's in a spectacular spot that the Bull's Eye of River Dorf [ph] and it's basically almost it's try to say it's according to say is it's almost the no replaceable asset it's got high sealing, it's got everything that you could want. It's got heavy loading, it's got everything that you could want in terms of a massive asset like this. So it was suffering under the - it was basically for a bunch of [indiscernible] that when in business had a business have been that all kinds of things.","So what David and his teams have done is more did so that we are changing the mix it's a very stable industry showroom tenants who pay who need to be in this [indiscernible] monopolistic building that they want to be in that industry. And to a cagy [ph] of very important fortune 100 tenants who are both principally and tech but also in other industries insurance and what have you. So that does two things so as David said it is remarks the income goes from $50 million to $80 million next year and it's going in the triple digits. And most important at all in terms of value creating the cap rate goes from I don't know what's the showroom tenants go for. So we're building a - floor. And 8 cap rate down to 5 cap rate and maybe even a sub 5 cap rate so as the income goes up and the cap rate goes down the value creation is enormous. So we're very pleased with that asset.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you so much for the color. I know that its 90 minutes and we're drawing close to the end of the hour so want to be sensitive if to be permitted to ask another question or I could queue up again later.","Steven Roth","Shoot.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. So I know if that the San Francisco question has been asked. But wondering specifically about your sort of partnerships or alliances or whatever you want to call them with incubator such as rework matter or fraction of leases like REIT especially in the San Francisco market. Given the news about the tech IPO and so on and all that stuff. How do you is there a change in your view or sort of conservative them or concern around it at all?","Steven Roth","555 California Street the so called Bank of America building is the dominant building in San Francisco with all due respect to the traffic what's in end of the new - building? With all due respect to the salesforce tower it's the dominant building it has the best roster of our financial services tenants of any building anywhere in the United States including in Manhattan. It is an iconic building it has long-term values and we're drilled on it for the long-term. Now we sale it but then again we might not. It is not on for sale or lease today and we believe that we believe the building a great building we believe it's a best state are certainly in front of it.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Operator","And our last question comes from Manny Korchman from Citi. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Thanks for taking the follow up. Just wanted to just on a Central Park South, could you share what your gross sales goal is and also the total saleable square footage in that project.","Steven Roth","The saleable square footage is 396,000 square feet and I will decline to give those proprietary numbers for the competitive reasons.","Manny Korchman","Thanks.","Operator","And we have no further questions.","Steven Roth","John that I just make one comment as an end comment. My guys are a little bit we note a negative comments that at the beginning this quarter and last quarter, which specifically relates to same-store a lower than our normal industry leading same-store number. There are lot of reasons for that. But it's leading to us also, but the numbers are what the numbers are and it relates principally to small picks of occupancy changes which are really pretty insignificant and the buildings coming in to service are coming out of service.","So I would just give you one statistic and that is that if you take four buildings that have been, that have gone out of service and that have come into service 7 West 34th Street, 330 West 33rd Street, 280 Park Avenue and 15 35 Broadway. Those three buildings which have come into service during different parts of the calendar this year will have $44 million of income this year throughout the year obviously loaded more towards the beginning of the year because they came into service over the course of the year.","As next year and those buildings are not in same store that other than same store pool, obviously are directly because of the accounting policies. Next year those four buildings are budgeted to have a $114 million of income of which $70 million will be same store next year. So we\u2019d expect that next year same store in addition to these buildings which are off the charge and so we apologize for the weaker than normal same store this year.","We\u2019re very sensitive, we consider all of this to be out of the port cause we love being at the head of the class, we are sorry that the numbers are low number and it\u2019s going to get a lot better, I mean a lot better enormously better next year. So that\u2019s all I have to say and so thank you all for participating. This was a long call, our policy on this call is to take every question in the queue, I feel the queue was exhausted and I think that\u2019s probably the most transparent the best policy we can have.","So thank you for participating. Next year, fourth quarter call will be on Wednesday February 17th which is a Wednesday and our queue will be published on the 16th which is the Tuesday of February. So thank you all very much we\u2019ll talk to you then, have a great day.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"21961":["Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) Q1 2014 Earnings Call May  6, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Catherine Creswell - ","Steven Roth - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Executive Committee","Stephen W.

My name is Vivian, and I'll be your operator for today's call. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Catherine Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust first quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our first quarter earnings release and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents, as well as our supplemental financial information package, are available on our website, www.vno.com, under the Investor Relations section.","In these documents and during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Also in the room are Wendy Silverstein and Michael Franco, Executive Vice Presidents, Co-Heads of Acquisitions and Capital Markets; and Joseph Macnow, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Administrative Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's first quarter call.","Let me start by saying that we remain committed to simplifying and focusing our business, and that we have made remarkable progress in that regard. It has been only 3 weeks since of the release of my annual letter to shareholders, and our announcement and call relating to the spinoff of our shopping center business. So my opening remarks this morning will be brief. We intend to file the Form-10 registration statement for SpinCo by the end of the second quarter, and expect the SpinCo -- the SpinCo spinoff to be completed by the end of 2014.","In the first quarter, we had $819 million of sales activity. We sold Broadway Mall for $94 million. We announced an agreement to transfer the redeveloped Springfield Town Center to Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust for $465 million, comprised of $340 million of cash, $125 million of PREIT Operating Partnership units. We also announced an agreement to sell Beverly Connection for $260 million. We currently have about $400 million in the market for sale, including 20 small non-Manhattan retail assets that don't fit in SpinCo, and our share of One Park Avenue and Georgetown Park.","As of today, we have $4 billion in liquidity, comprised of $1.6 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, and $2.4 billion of undrawn under our revolving credit facility. These amounts don\u2019t include the proceeds of the pending or perspective sales I just mentioned. Our financial capacity will allow us to take advantage of whatever external opportunities present themselves. In the short-term, we will use $445 million of cash to repay our 7% and 7.88% senior unsecured notes due in 2039, which are initially callable in October 2014. This debt repayment alone will increase FFO by $0.18 per share.","Our pipeline of internal value creating opportunities is extremely robust. I will just kickoff here, those projects that are currently in construction are now in construction. David will cover the New York projects in slightly more detail in his remarks.","Under construction. Our super tall 220 Central Park South residential condominium tower. Our massive retail and signage transformation of the Marriott Marquis site at the bull's-eye of the Times Square Bow Tie, across the street from our 1540 Broadway full block retail and signage. Our 1.1 million square-foot redevelopments at 330 West 34th Street and 7 West 34th Street, which are targeted to the creative class market.","The transformation of the 1.2 million square-foot 280 Park Avenue, of which we own 15%. The 44,000 square-foot Top Shop 4 level flagship at 608 Fifth Avenue. Our 699 unit residential project in Pentagon City, which has Whole Foods at its base. The 1.4 million square-foot Springfield Mall total redevelopment, which is on schedule for holiday opening to this year. The redevelopment of Wayne Town Center in Wayne, New Jersey. This is a very significant construction redevelopment program, indeed, and this list doesn't include any of the opportunities in the Penn Plaza District.","Now to leasing. Company-wide in the quarter, we leased 1,746 thousand square feet in 144 transactions with positive mark-to-markets of 7.9% cash and 12.6% GAAP. In the quarter, we leased 947,000 square feet in Manhattan alone -- 947,000 square feet in Manhattan alone.","Turning to operations. We had a strong first quarter, I'm very pleased with our financial results. In our first quarter, comparable FFO was $1.20 per share, 6.2% higher than last year's first quarter. Our New York business continues to put up very strong industry-leading metrics.","Our Washington business continues to bump along the bottom. Recently we have seen an uptick in activity. As I've said before, we believe there is no value in our share price for the vacancy in Washington. As such, we anticipate tremendous value creation as we lease up this space. To sum it up, I'm very pleased with both our operating performance and our progress on simplification and focusing the business.","Now I turn it over to Steve Theriot, CFO, to cover our financial results.","Stephen W. Theriot","Thank you, Steve. Yesterday we reported first quarter comparable FFO of a $1.20 per share, up from a $1.13 in the prior year's first quarter, a 6.2% increase. First quarter comparable EBITDA was $397.2 million.","Starting with New York. Our New York business produced $233.8 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, ahead of last year's first quarter of 8.7%, primarily driven by a very strong same-store increase of 6.2% in property acquisitions.","Our Washington business produced $84.1 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter behind last year's first quarter by just $2.2 million. As we did mention on last quarter's call, we expect Washington's 2014 comparable EBITDA to be approximately $10 million to $15 million behind 2013. While we were expecting a slight increase in occupancy in Washington during 2014, the lag between the signing of the leases we expect and the contribution to our earnings from these leases will push the full effect of the expected leasing activity to 2015. In addition, more than offsetting the expected reduction in comparable EBITDA, during 2014 we will realize an interest expense reduction of $16 million from the restructuring of the Skyline mortgage loan.","In summary, while we expect comparable EBITDA from our Washington segment to be $10 million to $15 million behind last year, we expect that contribution to comparable FFO to be $1 million to $6 million ahead of last year. Our retail strips and malls business produced $52.2 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, ahead of last year's first quarter by 2.8%. We leased 233,000 square feet at the strip shopping centers, with a positive marked-to-market of 9.4% GAAP and 3.1% cash. We leased 25,000 square feet at the malls, with a positive marked-to-market of 14.7% GAAP and 5.3% cash. Occupancy at the strip centers was 93.9% at quarter end, down 40 basis points on a sequential basis from the fourth quarter, and down 30 basis points from the 2013's first quarter. Occupancy for the malls was 95.7%, down 20 basis points from the fourth quarter, and up 80 basis points from 2013's first quarter.","Total first quarter FFO was $1.31 per share, as compared to $1.08 per share in the prior year's first quarter. Noncomparable items in this quarter, were positive $20.2 million, or $0.11 per share of income, compared to negative $9.8 million, or $0.05 per share of loss for the first quarter of last year. This year's first quarter noncomparable items included $9.6 million of net gains on the sale of a land parcel and residential condominiums, $9.3 million for our share of Toys FFO and $4.1 million of FFO from discontinued operations. The $9.3 million of Toys FFO represents management fees and real property depreciation, as we completely offset our $75.2 million share of Toy's equity in earnings with a $75.2 million impairment loss. To continue to carry our investment in Toys at $80 million estimate of fair value.","In the last year's first quarter, we similarly impaired our share of Toys' earnings. Please see our press release or the overview in MD&A on Page 33 of our Form 10-Q for a complete summary of noncomparable items.","Let we take a moment to explain the change in our total revenues line. While it looks like total revenues decreased for the quarter, like-for-like, total revenues actually increased $28 million, or 4.4% over the prior year's first quarter, when adjusted to exclude last year's onetime, $59.6 million of income from the Stop & Shop litigation, $14.4 million of revenue from Independence Plaza, which was de-consolidated in last year's second quarter, and $12.1 million of fees from the Cleveland Medical Mart development project, which we sold.","Now turning to capital to markets. In January, we completed a $600 million loan secured by our 220 Central Park South development site. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% and has the final maturity of January 2019. In April, we completed a $350 million refinancing of 909 Third Avenue. With interest only loan is at 9. -- I'm sorry, is at 3.91% fixed and matures in May 2021. We realized net proceeds of $145 million after repaying the existing 5.64%, $193 million mortgage, defeasance costs and other closing costs. We also completed a $300 million refinancing of the office portion of 731 Lexington Avenue, owned by Alexander's, our 32.4% affiliate. The interest only loan is at LIBOR plus 0.95%, currently 1.10%. It has a final maturity of March 2021. The proceeds of the new loan were used to repay the existing $312 million, 5.33% fixed rate loan and closing cost.","Our consolidated debt-to-enterprise value is 34.5%, and our consolidated debt-to-EBITDA is 6.9x. Our debt mix is balanced with fixed-rate debt accounting for 86% of the total, with a weighted average rate of 4.73%, and weighted average term of 6.6 years. Our floated rate debt -- floating-rate debt accounted for 14% of the total, with a current weighted average interest rate of 2.47% and a weighted average term of 4.3 years.","Our 2014 maturities are just $133.7 million, and our 2015 maturities are $941 million, including $500 million of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due April 2015. As Steve mentioned, we intend to repay the $445 million of 7% and 7.88% senior unsecured notes due 2039, which were initially callable in October 2014. This repayment alone will generate incremental FFO of $0.18 per share per year. Each of the rating agencies has reaffirmed our ratings, subsequent to the -- to our announcement of the retail spend transaction.","And with that, I'll turn it over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business.","David R. Greenbaum","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Before I turn to our results for the quarter, I'll spend a minute on the market.","Since year end, leasing velocity has continued to accelerate. In fact, absorption in the first quarter was the highest quarterly total we've seen in the past 10 years from 1.5 million square feet of positive absorption.","Let me highlight several of the headlines from the various market reports produced by the brokerage community, that sum up our view of the market. One request states, \"the Manhattan office market keeps on motoring.\" While another brokerage advices its tenants, \"a brisk beginning to the year means fewer options and rising rents.\"","Let me now focus on our performance for the first quarter. We had an exceptionally productive first quarter with 947,000 square feet of office leasing in 45 transactions, with an average term of 11.7 years. This 947,000 square feet is for the first quarter only, and does not include the 355,000 square-foot Neuberger Berman lease we announced just last week. Activities was well balanced throughout the portfolio, not concentrated in any one submarket. Of the 947,000 square feet, 45% of their activity was new tenants or expansions by existing tenants, and 55% was renewals. First quarter office occupancy was 96.9%, up 30 basis points from the fourth quarter. Basically, we are full. Our average starting rent this quarter was a healthy $62.39 with very strong positive mark-to-markets of 18.2% GAAP and 14.8% cash.","The first quarter leasing activity included a 102,000 square-foot lease renewal at 90 Park Avenue with FactSet Research Systems, the financial analytical software company. I have not spent any time on prior calls discussing this 41-story, 932,000 square foot tower, the entire block front between 39th and 40th streets on the West side of Park Avenue. 90 Park Avenue was originally known as the Sterling Winthrop pharmaceuticals building. Sterling Winthrop, which is now a subsidiary of Bare Pharmaceuticals, was the lead tenant in the building when we acquired it in 1987, occupying over 50% of the building. Over the years, Bare has subleased much of its space. With 450,000 square feet of scheduled lease expirations over the next 2 years, 2015 and 2016, we've commenced a capital program to reposition the building, similar to what we recently completed a 1290 Avenue of the Americas. Our plans for this building include new mechanical systems, modernized elevators, and a total lobby transformation. We're excited to have kicked off our leasing program with FactSet, and have very good activity here.","In Midtown South, at 1.1 million square-foot 770 Broadway, located between 8th and 9th Street, Facebook expanded by 58,000 square feet just weeks after moving into their new premises, and now leases a total of 160,000 square feet with Creative Hub, which is the headquarters of J. Crew, AOL, and Facebook. And we're now working with Facebook to produce even more space for their growth. Tenants love this building.","In Penn Plaza this quarter, we completed some really important transactions. Old tech, a term I recently heard on CNBC, has also been active. At our 2.5 million square-foot One Penn Plaza, technology giant Cisco recommitted long-term, with an 80,000 square-foot renewal for its New York headquarters, and ADP also renewed its 32,000 square-foot New York headquarters' lease.","At our 330 West 34th Street redevelopment, we kicked off the leasing program with a 178,000 square-foot headquarters lease with New York and company, which will be occupying 4 full floors in the building. We have a lease out now with a technology tenant for another 80,000 square feet. Activity at both 330 West and 7 West 34th street is high, and we are pleased with the market's reaction to our building transformation programs. Our entire $7.5 million square-foot Penn Plaza portfolio continues to be full, with our occupancy at 97.3%.","At 650 Madison Avenue, the 600,000 square-foot trophy office and retail asset we acquired a 21. -- a 20.1% interest in last fall. We continued making triple digit deals. In our first quarter, we completed one lease and subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed a second lease for a total of 32,000 square feet. All average rents of $150 per square foot.","And finally, and importantly, just last week, obviously, after the end of the first quarter, we announced that Capstone of our 2.1 million square-foot 1290 Avenue of the Americas transformation. Neuberger Berman, one of the leading investment managers, has committed to 355,000 square feet. Entire floors 22 to 29 and 38 to 43 for 20 years, taking the space currently occupied by Morrison & Forester, as well as the space leased to Warner Music through 2017. To produce this space for Neuberger Berman, we entered into a surrender agreement with Warner Music, which will be paying an $11.7 million lease termination fee. The marked-to-market on the Neuberger Berman lease is a positive 12.3% GAAP and 6.6% cash.","When originally constructed in 1963, 1290 was known as the Sperry Rain building, then Axa Financial center and it's now Neuberger Berman building, primely [ph] located on Sixth Avenue's Corporate Row. Since our acquisition of 1290 Avenue of the Americas in 2007, we have now leased over 1.5 million square feet in this 2.1 million square-foot building, raising rents by some $22 per square foot, or 40% higher in growing the NOI from below $60 millions to north of $100 million stabilized.","Let me now turn to our Manhattan Street retail, where we completed in April, a long-term lease renewal with Coach at 595 Madison Avenue, on the corner at 57th Street. We achieved very strong mark-to-markets of 83.1% GAAP and 44.2% cash for this 11,500 square-foot, 3-level flagship lease to Coach. In the first quarter we completed 3 small retail leases totaling 11,000 square feet with marked-to-markets of 44.3% cash and 7% GAAP. As Steve mentioned, we have development and redevelopment projects underway, all over our New York portfolio. At 220 Central Park South, excavation for a luxury condominium tower is now down 30 feet, well into rock. The Bow Tie of Times Square at 1535 Broadway at Marriott site, with the steel we have already erected, we could begin to visualize the enormity of the full block 8-story high LED screen we're constructing. At 7 West 34th and 330 West 34th Street, you can poke your head into lobbies and witness the transformation of these buildings into 1.1 million square feet of tech creative space. At 280 Park Avenue, our joint venture with SL Green, the mid-box dual box atrium, we will be delivering this fall to complement the full block Park Avenue lobby. At 608 Fifth Avenue, we're delivering possession next week to Topshop-Topman, with 44,000 square-foot, 4 level flagship. At 689 Fifth Avenue, working together with the Landmarks Preservation Commission, we are restoring the base of the building to its original limestone grandeur. And for our Alexander's affiliate, tower crane is up and concrete is now being poured for the 300 units rental apartment tower being constructed on top of the Rego Park new shopping center. We expect to top out in the fall and begin leasing apartments next spring. I invite you to drive around the city and see all this activity firsthand.","I spent some time on our last call discussing the strong activity we've had at our 1.8 million square-foot 555 California Street. This massive granite building dominates the Skyline and is the best office building in San Francisco.","In the first quarter, we signed 4 leases totaling 114,000 square feet, the highlight of which was a 49,000 square-foot lease with Microsoft, which will be moving its San Francisco office into the second and third floors. The second floor has 27-foot ceilings allowing Microsoft to establish a unique presence visible from the street. We also signed a 30,000 square-foot lease renewal with Wells Fargo and a 28,000 square-foot lease with Regis. At the 3.5 million square-foot Chicago Mark building, located at the center of the hot River North submarket, we completed 31,000 square feet of leasing this quarter.","Motorola, Google also completed moving to 600,000 square feet of space in the building. And on April 22, celebrated by hosting a ribbon cutting reception with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, delivering the key note remarks. And its space is really cool, really transformative. A combination of R&D, lab, tech and office space to Motorola's over 2,000 employees. Images of Motorola's space are now posted on the link on our home page at www.vno.com. And just last night, we teed up for execution an additional 60,000 square-foot lease with a major technology tenant, which we expect to sign in the next couple of days, continuing the transformation of our iconic Mart building into a hub for tech office tenants. This building is a buzz of activity.","To conclude my remarks, let me summarize the entire New York division. It had a very strong quarter. Our key performance metrics are industry-leading with same-store EBITDA increases for the overall division of 6.2% GAAP and 10.1% cash. Isolating just the New York Office business, our same-store EBITDA increased 7.8% GAAP and 10.4% cash.","And I am now going to turn the call over to Mitchell to cover Washington.","Mitchell N. Schear","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our first quarter results. We've seen an uptick in activity, and we continue to think we'll see meaningful traction in the later part of this year and into the next. We completed 365,000 square feet of office and retail leases in 62 separate transactions. Overall, office leases signed in the first quarter generated a GAAP marked-to-market of positive 3.9% and a cash mark-to-market of negative 3.1%. Our total occupancy, including residential, was down slightly by 10 basis points from Q4 to 83.3%, which is way down by Skyline's 58.7% occupancy. Excluding skyline, our overall occupancy actually increased by 40 basis points to 88.1% and office -- office only occupancy increased by 30 basis points to 85.7%. Quarter-over-quarter, we reported flattish same-store EBITDA changes equal to positive 0.5% cash and negative 2.5% GAAP. In addition to our 365,000 square feet of office leasing, we signed a lease this quarter with WeWork to repurpose a 165,000 square-foot vacant office building in Crystal City into their exacting new residential concept. By the middle of next year, they will open 250 community style residential units, with an imaginative design and dynamic shared social space. We believe this concept will attract a whole new dynamic demographic to Crystal City, complementing our tech creative cost initiatives, that I will elaborate on shortly.","Crystal City is an irreplaceable location. It is contiguous to DC on the shores of the Potomac with superb transportation and excellent views. With its live-work-play infrastructure, we see enormous potential for Crystal City to become a new hub for the tech and creative community. These smart millennials are in high demand by employers and infuse fresh energy into neighborhoods. On the last call, I introduced several transformative moves to attract this important growing demographic to Crystal City. Over the past 60 days, we put several things into motion.","First, in mid-March we launched our design lab at 251 18th Street. We created 6 prebuilt office suites for lease, each designed by a different architect, specifically for creative companies. Marketed as a showcase for office innovation, design lab drew over 1,500 people in its first 30 days and has generated great press. Already several of those suites are leased, and we started planning for design lab 2. In April we launched Crystal Tech, the home of a new $50 million technology fund. Crystal Tech has joined the creative community in 2 ways. First, the fund is headed by 500 Startup's founder, Paul Singh, a global expert in the venture capital and tech world. The fund is investing in high growth post seed companies who are co-locating Crystal City. Six different tech companies have already moved in. The idea is over time, they will take root, track others and mature here.","In addition, events for the tech community are being hosted regularly in the space by Tech Cocktail, a well-known tech media company that acts as the magnet for bringing together the millennials.","On our opening night, hundreds of entrepreneurs packed into Crystal City. Also in April, TechShop opened their new 22,000 square-foot prototyping studio in Crystal City. This studio provides tools, equipment, technology and classes for inventors, engineers and entrepreneurs. These openings, along with the bringing WeWork to Crystal City, are generating just a kind of action we are seeking, and we believe these initiatives will help drive tenants and users to Crystal City.","In addition, Crystal City continues to attract associations and nonprofitable organizations. The combination of our proximity to Capitol Hill, adjacency to Reagan National and an abundance of hotels has made Crystal City a location of choice for this sector. Today Crystal City is home to over 20 major associations and nonprofits. In the first quarter we completed new and extension leases in Crystal City with several associations, including a new lease with American Public Power Association for 22,700 square feet, an extension and expansion of the Food Marketing Institute to now 44,200 square feet and an extension and expansion of communities in schools to now 16,500 square feet. In April, MSI, an international development consulting firm, moved from Washington, DC into their new 51,000 square-foot space in Crystal City.","Our residential portfolio continues to deliver strong results with 96.8% occupancy. We own more than 2,400 apartments, clustered in very desirable urban submarkets in Crystal City, Pentagon city, Rosslyn and Georgetown.","In summary, as we lease up and change we will create value. We will lease our vacancy, an effort that is continuing. We are actively transforming Crystal City into a new hub for tech and creative. We're place making here and this is happening now.","And we look forward to harvesting our $7 million square-foot pipeline of new development, some of which is underway right now in Pentagon City. We are currently excavating a 2-acre site, the first step in the construction of our 700 unit apartment delivery in the middle of 2015. We're excited about our many internal opportunities to create value.","Thank you very much. And I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Michael Knott from Green Street Advisors is on the line with a question.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Steve, question for you on New York retail, or David. I think, Steve in your annual letter you said you're working on the mother of all rollovers. I would suspect that you are talking about 645 Fifth Avenue and also we saw in e-mail trade rag the other day a speculation about the first $4,000 per foot rent. Just curious if there is any progress that you can report on that lease.","David R. Greenbaum","The mother of all rollovers is trying to drive up to the hospital and get into the delivery room. So we have nothing yet to report, Michael. But we love that property.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, just moving to DC, Mitchel, curious if you're still thinking that you're going to end the year higher on occupancy. And then also, I guess for Steve Theriot, I'm wondering, if you guys have sort of the equivalent for your DC guidance for this year on a cash EBITDA basis, since it was picked up this quarter that was slightly positive surprise for me. And I'm just curious if the down guidance on EBITDA for the share, if you have sort of the equivalent on a cash basis.","Mitchell N. Schear","Michael, this is Mitchell. I would continue to believe that based on the activity we have, we will in fact end the year in a positive position from where we are.","Stephen W. Theriot","And to answer the question, Michael, about do we have a comparable cash EBITDA forecast or guidance for the year, we've not issued -- we're not planning to issue other guidance beyond the GAAP EBITDA guidance.","David R. Greenbaum","Michael -- Michael, let me go back to your first point about the mother of all retail rollovers. So just as I mentioned a little bit of math for you, that building has 10,000 square feet on the grade in the H&M space. And another scant 2,000 feet adjacent to it, and which is occupied by Citibank. So it's a scant 12,000 square feet. So you could put a dimension on what market rents are and prime, prime, prime Fifth Avenue, and then say it has a 3 as the first number. And the incumbency in there is less than probably somewhere in the $7 billion net rent number. So this is going to be at market rents, 4 or more times -- 400% or more times marked to market. And those are -- so we have been in our short-term future, something that we're extremely excited about it. It's an enormously important property. And here we go.","Operator","Michael Bilerman from Citi is online with a question.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Steve, you talked about the significant amount of liquidity that you have today. Certainly, you can include all the liquidity in cash that still want to come up next 12 months from the deals you've already executed. And I'm just curious, how you think, I know you've talked about tendering for the debt that comes due later this year. And how do you think about the investment and putting that cash to work now that you've made tremendous progress on the certification.","Stephen W. Theriot","Michael, first of all we love cash. We love liquidity. We love to have the liquidity when markets are in chaos or when markets are allowing giving us bargains. We are rigorous. We are disciplined. We are not going to spend cash because we have it. So we have -- we have learned over the 40 years that we've been doing this that you have to act counter-cyclically, meaning you have to raise cash when money is easy, as it is now, and spend it when money is tight and nobody else has it. So with respect to investing, I've said over the last year or 2, that investing is difficult, prices are high. It's a better market for selling than it is for investing. And I have said over the recent past that we will be a net seller as we have been. We do not fear holding cash, in fact we like it. Having said that, somehow or other, we always manage to scrape together the better part of a billion dollars even in a snowy year, even when prices are high of opportunistic investments, which we think fit into our portfolio. So the answer is to your question, which I think is a very good one, we are not adverse to holding cash. We think that, that creates an enormous strategic advantage to our firm, number one. Number two is that we will be very rigorous and we will be very disciplined in investing. Number three, we think that there will be better times for investing, meeting better values in the future. We can't proportion when that is. And having said all that, we are a very large and important party in the New York and Washington markets. We see every deal and we manage to, in this market, get a few, but we don't really want to get every deal because we think it's not the best optimum buying time.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just a follow-up for David Greenbaum, so your signage income keeps on going up as you move to the LED lighting. You're up about $12 million last year, up almost $3 million in the first quarter. I'm just curious how big of a business that has become for you, if you think about $730 million of New York NOI. How much does signage now represent and how much further can that number go? And is there a big capital investment that goes along with the change to LED where effectively you're getting increased NOI, but you're having to put some capital for it?","Stephen W. Theriot","Michael, I'll handle the beginning of that, and David can come in and correct me. First of all, most of the signs that we -- first of all, we love the signage business, okay, we love it. We think it's a very unique and very important business. Second, most of the signs that we own are throw-ins, if you can use that word, to the real estate assets that we own. So they're augmentary to that. On occasion we have brought some signs, but very, very rarely. On occasion, certainly in the Marriott deal, the signage was important in the value, but the -- it was really a tag along, it wasn't the main determinant of the value, although that sign would be incredible. And we did make a payment to buy back the long-term contract to a signage operator in that deal. The signs do require a capital investment. We are anxious to make that investment, and the payback on that investment is -- on those capital investments are less than 2 years. So having said all that, now David, you can go ahead.","David R. Greenbaum","The only thing I'll add Michael is, as Steve said, substantially, the substantial portion of the sign business, effectively is keyed into the retailers. So that is called \"recurring income\". There are a couple of signs at 1540 Broadway that came online, which is the reason for the increase, but that's the recurring increase. A small portion of the business is attributable to effectively selling slots on the LEDs and that business is a little bit more seasonal. We did well in the first quarter because we were able to take advantage of the Super Bowl opportunity at 1540 at the Bow Tie in Times Square.","Stephen W. Theriot","Michael, think about it for a second. The signs have value. This street signs have value in the highest traffic locations. So that if you're in a low traffic location, they have less value. So where we traffic is in Times Square and in Penn Station, the 2 highest traffic locations in the city. And so definitionally, the signs have enormous value. And as David said, most of the signage income comes from retailers, who'll make package deals where we rent them space and we rent the sign to them above their store around their store or whatever on a long-term basis. So the fact that we have a thriving signage business is indicative of the fact that we have a thriving street retail business that connects to it.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I asked the question on a positive light, because it is growing.","Stephen W. Theriot","I'm trying to -- we're trying to tell you that the strategy of it and how we see the business.","Operator","Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill is online with a question.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess, continuing on the street retail theme, if you could just talk a little bit about Topshop and if we should expect it -- almost sounds like the income we should expect to -- you guys start recognizing income this year or maybe give some perspective on that? In addition, the Marriott retail, there's a bunch of more capital to spend but in the Q talks about all -- everything completes at the end of this year. So if you can just help us give our framework for how we should think about the NOI coming online over the next year or 2, as well as, I guess, it's a follow-up on Michael's question. How we should think about trying to guestimate what a 300 foot wide 6-story Times Square LED sign, what kind of NOI that's going to throw up?","Stephen W. Theriot","Okay. Let me see if I can catch your questions in order. I am going to ask David on the technical -- our financial guys to chime in. The Topshop lease will -- we are turning over space to them next week. In fact, the British owner of Topshop will be in our office this afternoon. And the -- so when will we begin rent commencement for that.","David R. Greenbaum","When we turn over the space next week.","Stephen W. Theriot","And also the GAAP rent will commence next week. Cash rent will commence when they open, and they will open right around Halloween and maybe, so either Halloween or a week later. I can tell you that this is an unbelievably interesting and important fashion tenant. If you've been in any of the stores, and I hope you had been, and so they're pretty theatrical, and there is going to be, to use a phrase that I've used recently, the mother of all Halloween parties in connection with that opening. With respect to Marriott, Marriott is proceeding the pace for a, probably, end of October beginning of November completion of the sign, which we're very excited about. And the retail leasing is proceeding. We are shifting through offers and deals now. We do not that expect to have it 100% occupied or actually even near that at the opening, but it will be -- it will lease extraordinarily -- extraordinarily well. We're getting a great reception from the market place. In terms of the mentioning, what the incomes are from those transactions, I think, that's not something that we normally disclose store-by-store or asset-by-asset.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I just have one follow-up question, actually. We have one colleague on our floor, who's very excited for the Topshop to open, it's just about a block away. But I think in the opening comments, it was either Steve or Mitch who mentioned about DC picking up next year that there is lot of leasing activity this year, where we won't see the benefit until next year. And again, if you could just sort of help us quantify how much pickup is going to be, we should look forward to you next year, clearly, we've all been waiting for Crystal City and Skyline to turnaround. So any bit of positive incremental is big, it's just trying to get everyone's perspective. Is it going to be a little bit, and we need to wait longer or is there some material stuff coming that could make it seem as though, we'll start to read better things about the DC portfolio.","Stephen W. Theriot","Alex, we're not prepared to give the guidance beyond what we have already given, which is where -- we're kind of skimpy on guidance, as you know. We don't think that there is a boom coming in next year. We think that there will be a gradual and slow uptick in activity. There is activity, but the market is extremely competitive. So we continue to be conservative in what we are budgeting, going forward through this year and next year.","Operator","Steve Sakwa from ISI Group is online with a question.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","David, I just wonder, if you could expand a little bit more on the New York City leasing momentum. And maybe just talk a little bit about the submarkets where you're seeing the best rent kind of Penn Station versus Grand Central versus the Plaza District? And how that might be impacting kind of the rents that you're thinking about for the 2 redevelopments on 34th Street?","Steven Roth","Generally, I'll tell you, we're seeing very good action in New York, as they say in my pipeline in terms of leases that we're working on for Q2, Q3. Very active. We've already chipped away significantly at our 15 expirations, I think, if -- we were talking a year ago, originally our 2015 expirations were north of 2 million square feet, 2.1 million, 2.2 million square feet. That's now down to somewhere a little over 1 million square feet. So again, aggressively we're working on that. And in terms of where we're seeing some real strengths, the high, high-end of the market, we're seeing very good activity, witness some of the deals that we've done at 280, 350 park, 280 park. We have 650 Madison Avenue, of course. But we've got space that's coming back to us next year at our little jewel box, 640 Fifth Avenue. We're excited to see some of those leases rollover. Generally I would tell you, at 7 West 34th Street and 330 West 34th Street, we are seeing there, again, very good activity and we're getting more aggressive in terms of what our expectations are for market rents for that space. So what we're doing generally across the portfolio, I would tell you, is reevaluating all of our rents. And we, right now, as part of that revaluation are looking at picking those rents up somewhat significantly. I would tell you, to have pockets of space in Penn Plaza and other creative type of space that we have around the portfolio, we've seen rent increases compared to where we are today from a year ago, probably a good 10% and 15%, and again, looking at taking those rents up a notch again.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess, second question, maybe to direct to Steve. I mean, you guys have obviously done a very good job pruning the portfolio and raising cash. I'm just wondering, given the strong appetite for core assets from overseas buyers where they're willing to accept maybe returns as low as 6%, and maybe even sub-6 in some markets. How do you think about potentially pruning some of the core assets in Washington and New York?","Stephen W. Theriot","The answer to that is that we get incomings weekly. The assets that we have, which are core and are in our New York and Washington portfolio are extremely in demand and in high demand, and we consider what to, whether to hold or to sell, et cetera, all the time. We are extremely confident that the majority of the assets that we have in Manhattan and in Washington have growth in front of them. And the way we look at it, Steve, is that would we rather have the cash or would we rather have the assets. So the answer is that we have not yet begun to prune anything, really anything substantially in New York or Washington. And we may very well sell a few assets, selectively, but not wholesale.","Operator","James Feldman from Bank of America is online with a question.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess going back to the Street retail portfolio, what are your latest thoughts on current mark-to-market across all of the assets?","Stephen W. Theriot","I don't really know, and I don't really think I can hazard a guess. I mean, the increase in rents over the last 10 years has been startling. The increase in rents in the markets that we're in has over the last 5 years, has been double startling or startling to the second power or the fourth power. And so we have a very, very substantial increase. And we benefit, by the way, from having amassed most of our portfolio before the rents rose, so that we have low basis and most of our incumbent tenants are at very low risk. So I don't really know what that number is. I mean, we budgeted out 3 or 4 years, and I don't really want to hazard a guess. I think we should do that as a product -- as a project, Joe. Anyway, so I really can't -- I can't really respond to the good question, it's a good question. But I can tell you it's enormous.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, thinking about the Neuberger release, can you talk a little bit about how many pieces like that are still in the market? And then, just the Neuberger decision specifically how they ended up at Sixth Avenue, what else they're considering and what we can read through to how maybe Midtown is holding in there versus Hudson Yards and downtown and some of the other options out there?","Stephen W. Theriot","Jamie, as you imagine a lease like this is going to be hotly, hotly contested in the marketplace. Neuberger had any number of options. They looked at new construction. They looked at multiple buildings on Sixth Avenue. I would tell you that when Neuberger first came to the building and recognized the transformation that we had undertaking in redeveloping this asset, I'd like to say they fell in love with it, and I think they did. I think the key to a lease like that was the major transformation we had undertaken in this building. And that means not only the cosmetic aspects, the lobby transformation, but all the mechanical infrastructure, which really has made a building like 1296 Avenue competitive with a brand-new asset in terms of the backup generation, power, HVAC and all the requirements that are critical for tenants in the marketplace. So hotly contested transaction. And candidly we were up against, as I said, really everybody in New York in getting this deal, we're thrilled with it.","Steven Roth","I just want to add one thing and that's a flunk for the Neuberger Berman management team and of course our management team. This is a major, major financial services money-management firm, really important, very well-known in the marketplace. They made a decision to consider real estate options. And one of which, of course, was to stay at a building that they've been in for 20 or 30 years. They were thorough, they were rapid, they were decisive, they were demanding, of course, once they made decisions, they moved very quickly. So some of the deals we make are torture, some of the deals we make are -- they're all tough but are a pleasure, and dealing with their team was a pleasure. And we're delighted to have them. And we think, of course, obviously they made the right choice. David and his team did a spectacular job in lassoing this tenant.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, how many leases like that would you say are still out there? Major, very large leases that are trying to decide between the thing on the east side maybe going to West side, what's the depth of demand right now?","Stephen W. Theriot","There are many number of large tenants that are running around. What we did see in the first quarter, which is encouraging, is that a significant number of these first quarter leases, large leases were, in fact, relocations not tenants just staying in place. So tenants are recognizing the need to update their space. Neuberger Berman, for example, is going to be reevaluating all of its space needs, as it looks to its next 20 years in the future. I think, generally, the very positive thing that we're seeing in the marketplace, in fact, we discussed this yesterday with one of the research houses, one of the brokerage firms, is that tenants once again in this cycle are beginning to recognize the way they grow their businesses by focusing on the topline. The way they focus on the topline is with their personnel. So I think we're out of that portion of the cycle where tenants are only looking at cutting expenses. Tenants are looking to the future, are looking to some health in the economy, and most importantly, are looking to where they should be putting their people over the next 20 years. So we are seeing some very good activity in the marketplace with tenants considering alternatives.","Operator","Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs is online with a question.","Bradley K. Burke - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Obviously, a lot of progress in the quarter, getting focused on New York office and retail in Washington office. But should we still thinking about California and Chicago as being long-term markets at this point, be as they -- I realize you've made, you're at an interesting point in the cycle for Merchandise Mart, but you made a lot progress at 555 California. I don't know if this is something that you could find itself in the on deck circle at any point for dispositions?","Stephen W. Theriot","These are -- to focus on those 2 assets, these are enormous assets. So we have 1.8 million square feet in at 555 California, which you know is the Bank of America building. It is the dominant, largest, tallest building in California, until Morris finishes up his Transbay building. And it's a great asset. It's been a -- real estate can't be done in the office, it has to be done in the field. And So David and I were out there recently. We try to go on out, it's just a great asset. So we believe that San Francisco is an extremely hot, aggressive market. We are realizing very, very positive marked-to-markets income increased out of that building. And we currently have no plans other than to realize the rental income in that building and realize the growth and enjoy it. Similarly, in Chicago, we own one asset there, it's another one asset town, but it's an enormous asset. It's a 3.5 million square-foot building, that we are totally transforming from a showroom building to an office building and to a tech creative type office building. It happens to be situated in the hottest submarket in town and when you think about it from a value creation point of view, that building will get a double or a triple whammy. The -- we will realize very substantial rent income growth there as we transition, and we will realize a value, a cap rate improvement, which you can just guess as to what a showroom with 5,000-foot, hundreds and hundreds of 5,000-foot, 4,000-foot showrooms than it gets, versus a building that has Google and the like. So both of these buildings have -- we have value creation too, in front of us. Very substantial value creation and these buildings are not on the for sale list.","Bradley K. Burke - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, actually just one on the weather, which is something that we've heard about impacting costs in the first quarter. I was wondering whether this was something that was meaningful for your portfolio. I mean, do you still had good same-store numbers in New York, but I don't know if this would have been meaningfully higher if we had a more normal year for weather.","Stephen W. Theriot","I grew up in the retail business, and I was -- I learned early on that anybody that uses the weather as an excuse is not a good -- not a good manager. So I'm not aware of anything. Do you have something in there, Mark?","David R. Greenbaum","No. Virtually, all of our retail leases -- the substantial portion our New York leases are best releases, so more snow removal, of course, which we certainly had, will be offset by accruals due from tenants.","Stephen W. Theriot","Let me put it this way. It's an interesting question. It would be an insubstantial number. For sure, the freezing winter that New York had, had to cause our energy and heating bills to go up. And why don't we take the project, as we mentioned that, okay. And for sure, our snow removal costs for our shopping centers went up. But I can tell you that it's not something that I'm aware of. Maybe I should be, but it's not. So if I'm not aware of it, it was insubstantial. We'll get that number together.","Operator","John Guinee from Stifel is on the line with a question.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great. We have zillions of questions, but let me just give a couple. First, David, I'm a huge fan of Manhattan, et cetera. But I'm actually a little bit surprised on the Neuberger Berman lease, that is up 12% on GAAP and 6% on cash. Can you talk a little bit more about the underlying details there, because I expected you had to write a big TI check. I got to believe there's a big leasing commission in there. You've outlined a lot of money you're putting into the base building. Can you talk about the upfront capital you're going to incur on that lease? And then also, talk maybe about how the expensed stock changes? And what is actually happened on a net rent basis for the space?","Stephen W. Theriot","John, we don't get into details of leases like that on individual tenants, rather we report in the aggregate. I can tell you that the lease was a market TI package and that the rent is market or maybe just executive market or maybe just a hair above market for this space that this customer has taken. So we're happy with the deal. We think it's a market deal, and whatever. Now if you look at the building overall, okay, David mentioned in his remarks that over the short-term ownership period that we've had we've relet 1.5 million square feet of this 2.1 million-square-foot building. This is an enormous building. We've taken the income level from a running rate of $60 million, when we bought it, to over $100 million today. And if you wanted to just do a little exercise, just for kicks, put a market cap rate on that $100 million plus income stream and that will give you a rough idea of what the building is worth and what it's worth per square foot. So we have a very, very substantial financial performance in the building as a whole, okay. Very, very acceptable.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Right. Okay. And then sort of, multipart.","Stephen W. Theriot","John, John. In numbers, this is a multibillion dollar building.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Big numbers, okay. And then my sort of a multipart second question, with all the asset sales, any taxable gain or special dividend issues? Second, we've known that -- noticed that your mezz loan portfolio is running off. Is that temporary or you're getting out of that business? Third, can you give us a quick update on Hotel Pennsylvania? And fourth, if we were trying to value Crystal City on an as is basis standalone do you think the number is 200 a foot, 300 a foot, 400 a foot, just any thoughts on that?","Steven Roth","Okay. Millions of questions. Thank you. Let\u2019s start. What was the first one again?","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","But they're quick answers. Taxable gain issues, special dividend issues, given all of the asset sales.","Steven Roth","I'm sad to tell you that our JCPenney situation created a capital loss carryforward so that retrospect, we have recognized gains on other sales, which will be washed out against that. So I don't anticipate a capital gain special dividend this year, although we are realizing substantial capital gains. Second question? What's that?","Catherine Creswell","Mezz loan portfolio.","Steven Roth","Yes, your observation is correct. We are letting our mezz loan portfolio run down. We're letting it run down for a couple of reasons. Number one, we've been busy as beavers in the big picture of focusing our big, huge, enormous $30 billion businesses. So that's step one. Step two is, is that the mezz loan business is a very interesting business. There are a handful of -- a small handful of specialty brands companies that do it. And to my knowledge, there's maybe 1 or -- I don't know, maybe more than 1, but I'm only aware of 1 REIT that really does the business other than ourselves. When you think about it for a second, it's really -- we believe in creating NAV as opposed to income. Both are important, but let's just focus. We believe our stock price trades on NAV. And if you -- mezz loans or a lending business inside a REIT is properly priced at book, so if you have a $100 million and you have it on cash, it will be valued at $100 million. Or if you have $100 million and you put it into a loan, it's valued similarly at par. So I think, recently, days ago, one of the analysts, I think Green Street, said that they were going to assign a 5% premium to book our mezz loan portfolio. So you can take that conclusion, we're not a 100% sure that the energy and risk that goes into mezz loans, it gets reflected in our stock price, and we're all about creating value for our shareholders and ourselves as shareholders. Most importantly, having said that, most importantly, we love to do -- to get into do loans and mezz loans or buy loans when the markets are really soft and you can buy loans at a discount, which has a shot at creating real estate at a discount. So once again, we're all about cyclicality. We're all about judging when do we -- what market timing is. And so we are building cash. When the markets get weak and we can buy other people's loans at discounts, you will be sure we will reenter that business with both feet. Having said all that, I think that the guys that do the business now are doing -- do a great job. They have a big business and it's all very terrific. But I think the strategy of the way we want to run our business and when we want it timed, we're in the real estate business. We want to buy loans to create real estate. Next question?","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Hotel Pennsylvania status, and then also if someone was looking at just value on Crystal City on a standalone as is basis, is the number $200, $300, $400 a square-foot?","Steven Roth","I'm not going to get into that question. I mean, if I gave you an answer to that question, they'd probably throw me in jail. So you're going to have to value Crystal City on your own. I can tell you, and I've said this multiple times over the last year or more, the way I do the math in our stock -- and that's very important to me. As I've said before, that's our report card. That's really -- we work all day to get a good report card. I do not believe that there is any value at all in our share trading price for the Crystal City vacancy. So the answer to that is, is that I believe the public market value of Crystal City, which has low value for the vacancy, okay, and skepticism for the balance of it, is less than the private market value. But we have no intention of selling that asset. We have every intention of working our ass off and leasing up that space and getting the value. With respect to the Hotel Pennsylvania, the Hotel Pennsylvania is a, as I said I think in my letter that was released 3 weeks ago, the big kahuna in our company -- and by the way, we have lots of enormous value creation things that we're working on, including marking up our retail portfolio and the developments that we kicked off and what have you, et cetera. The big kahuna is the Penn Plaza District, which has lots of extraordinary things going for it. So we have the busiest train station in North America in the middle of our holdings. We have the biggest and most highest volume department store, that's Macy's, in the world, in the middle of our holdings. We have Madison Square Garden in the middle of our holdings. We have the catwalk on the streets, et cetera. Retail rents have climbed to $1,000 a foot on the street, et cetera. So but most importantly, Penn Plaza District is the home of the better part of 8 million square feet of office space that we own. And so the big value creation is that office space is now in demand. As David has said over and over again, we are full and have been full down there at a 97% average occupancy for 15 years. We have a similar occupancy today. So the big kahuna is to get the average rents to move up in that district, which is what we're all about. And we will invest significant capital dollars and rehabilitate the streets, the buildings, et cetera to do that. The Hotel Penn is an integral part of that, and we're in the throes of the decision-making process. We've been slow, we've been tardy, all for good reasons. And you can -- you will begin to see significant stuff happening in the Hotel Penn and the Penn Plaza District over the next years. I'm going to say, this is a 2, 3, 4 year project that we're about to embark upon. We would benefit enormously, as I've said before, from what Vornado is doing in Hudson Yards and we have benefited enormously from the shift in the geography of Manhattan's sliding -- tilting slightly to the South and significantly to the West. So state zones there, we're really excited. This is the big kahuna, which, once again, also has the no value whatsoever in our stock.","Operator","Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley is on the line with a question.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just back on the street-level retail, you've mentioned the enormous potential, and I know it's tough to gauge, but when you think about the ability to raise rents even further, do you think the best locations that already have the most impressive rents, is that where the best upside is? Or does your gut tell you that really needs to plateau some and perhaps there's more upside from the lower-rent locations that might follow in the footsteps of the more expensive properties? Is that what really moves the needle from here, or is it both?","Steven Roth","That's a very interesting question, which we ask ourselves daily and weekly. The rule of the jungle is the best gets better more quickly than mediocre gets good. So if you think about any investing, buying securities, buying property, buying art, whatever it might be, you always buy the best. So the way we do it is it's a very, very -- a very, very -- business isn't that complicated. When you buy a retail asset, you know what the sales volume of the incumbent tenant is doing, and you can gauge what the rent potential of that asset is from that. So our job is to buy under rented and raise the rents, buy in great places where there's enormous traffic. So we know what the sales volumes are, we can work on the streets, we see the traffic on the streets, okay? So having said all that, so we believe in the future of the dominant shopping streets, our neighborhoods in New York are, going from North to South, Madison Avenue, Fifth Avenue, Times Square, 34th Street, 14th Street and SoHo. Those are the neighborhoods which where all the traffic are -- where all the traffic is, and that's where we try to invest. Now we have been toying with the idea of saying, with a company of our size, we should have some R&D, like every major non-real estate company has. So what would R&D be? R&D would be, for us, taking a measured amount of capital, not a lot, but not insubstantial, and looking for the cutting next edge, which we do all the time. So having said that, we're really happy with investing in the tried and proven neighborhoods.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, I know you are excited about 220 Central Park South. So I just wanted to give you a chance to discuss it a little further. Could you remind us of the proposed construction schedule? Are you already getting any early indications of interest in the condos about when can you realistically think about pre-leasing? Could that be something for us to look forward to in 2015?","Steven Roth","So first of all, we are really excited about this. This is the best for sale apartment project in New York. It is in the front-row, directly on Central Park. It's adjacent to the Columbus Circle neighborhood, which has had enormous improvements. And so this is the real McCoy. We have -- it's been a struggle, but it's been a joyous and worthwhile struggle. And so we've been at it for 8 years. We are, as David said and I said, we are under massive construction. We have, I think, 6 pieces of equipment in this little -- in this hole which is getting deeper and deeper and bigger and bigger. So the answer is that we have enjoyed a significant uplift in our basis as to what the market value of the land is. I would mention that has easily 2.5x our basis. So that puts us into a very, very attractive financial position. We had chosen to finance the land basically at approximately what our basis is. So you all know that, that's been disclosed. You all know that arithmetic. We have gotten a very significant, very significant number of incomings about people who want to see, understand and purchase in the building; nothing binding, of course. We expect that we will be in full blast sales of the selling of the project, probably in the first quarter of next year. And we expect the building to take about 3 years or perhaps a smidge longer to complete. We're really excited about it. If you give me a call, I'd like to sell you a very expensive apartment.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'll look into it.","Operator","Ross Nussbaum from UBS is now on the line.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit more about the WeWork lease down in Crystal City from a number of different perspectives? I guess, first is, to my understanding, this will be the first residential buildout that they have done. Historically, they've done all these collaborative office situations. So just talk a little bit about your comfort in their executing on that. And then, second, just the economics of this lease, because the rent is perhaps lower than what I would, frankly, expect office space would lease for in Crystal City. So should we be thinking about this from the standpoint of being a little bit of a loss leader in terms of what the end game is in Crystal City?","Steven Roth","You're 100% correct. It is -- if you put down a pro forma as to what an office building might lease for versus this, you're 100% correct. It looks kind of like a loss leader. But let me tell you the way our management team looks at this. Number one, this is a scant 2% of our inventory down there. Number two, it's transformative. It's really important that we get this kind of clientele coursing through Crystal City. We believe we have been dancing with the WeWork management team for several years now. We believe these are -- these folks are extraordinarily gifted. They have great ideas, great execution. We believe -- you're right, this is going to be their launch of an residential WeLive [ph] kind of a project. We believe it will attract the same demographic as the WeWork project -- the WeWork office counter party. And we think it's an essential to our strategy of changing slightly or even more than slightly, the major complexion and -- of Crystal City's demographic, and it's essential in place making. So having said all that, now, think about it. 165,000 foot building. It's a higher building. It's a building we would have had to put enormous capital in to convert to an office building. And it would have been at the end of the Q and maybe it wouldn't have rented for 3 or 4 or 5 years, okay? But we think that this is an enlightened transaction, which is important. I can tell you that Mitchell Schear is the proponent of all this, and he believes in it and our whole team believes in it.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And will the rent gross or net at $25 a foot lease?","Steven Roth","That is a -- let me just think about that for a minute. That is a net lease.","David R. Greenbaum","Right. So there will be some additional expenses on top of that to get to the full service equivalent.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. My second question is, just on the simplification front. This hasn\u2019t really been talked a lot about in the past, but can you talk about the timeline for monetizing the real estate fund. What's the endgame there?","Steven Roth","Michael and Wendy are in the room to run the funds for us. The first 2 assets are in the market now. I think in my remarks, I said that one part, which is the fund asset, is in the market now. And Georgetown Park, which is the largest single hunk of retail in Georgetown in the Washington, DC district, is also in the market now. So as we feel that the assets in the fund are ripe and are ready to market, I mean, our business in the fund is to sell them and realize the proceeds, okay? So the first 2 are in the market now.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And lastly, is there a world in which Alexander's is going to be a part of Vornado, or should we stop having those silly thoughts?","Steven Roth","No. I wouldn't call it silly, but I said there is no world that, that would happen, I don't think.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","There's no world where -- I'm trying to get through double negative there. So you're saying it is still a possibility?","Steven Roth","I had a problem in my college application, 800-Math, 0-English, okay? So let me try it again, there is no -- there is no way that I would foresee that Alexander's and Vornado would combine.","Operator","David Harris from Imperial Capital is on the line with a question.","David Bryan Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Just one question for Steve Theriot. You're capitalizing cost at about 40 -- an annual rate of about $0.40 a year. I'm just thinking, if that -- is that a good go-forward number? In particular, could you sort of talk about how much capital costs are being capitalized with regard to the spinout properties and also things that we know are going to go away, like Springfield Town Center?","Stephen W. Theriot","Well, David, the amount of capitalized cost interest and taxes is going to be variable based on the amount of development that we've got going in any one point in time. And so at 220 Central Park and as Springfield Mall got into development, big -- the capital -- for GAAP purposes, the basic instruments, we've got a capitalized interest, was significant. That will be lumpy as those projects come out of development as Springfield Mall come -- goes online holiday season this year. So that's going to be a lumpy number and won't -- it's hard to say if there's going to be a constant run rate for that. I'm not sure if that's exactly what you were getting at David?","David Bryan Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Well, let me take it to Steve and ask a question with regard to setting the dividend. Steve, when you and the Board consider setting the dividend, do you just ignore the capitalized costs or do you take them into account?","Steven Roth","We take in -- we are -- our dividend is guided, first and foremost, by taxable income, okay, which is a different calculation. It's not exact calculation.","Joseph Macnow","David, it's Joe. That does include, of course -- taxable income does include charging projects and development with interest. And typically, between 5% and 6% on the asset value -- not the equity value, the asset value is what we're capitalizing. So at Springfield, if a job is $250 million, 10% is $12.5 million -- 5% is $12.5 million a year...","David Bryan Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I'm just thinking -- I don\u2019t want to prolong the conversation, but the -- I'm just thinking in terms of your consideration of what's the real cash flow cover on the dividend that you and the Board might set? Is that inclusive of the capitalized cost or exclusive of the capitalized cost? Or are you saying you don't look at that at all because you're looking at taxable income as your first point of reference.","Steven Roth","Yes, that's correct. And then to the extent that we pay interest, that's a tax reduction, okay? So the fact that we capitalize it in our GAAP statement doesn't really have very much effect on our taxable financial statements. So the answer is, is that our taxable income would be reduced by the interest that we pay on a cash basis, which is so that the answer is, is we do take into effect the capitalized interest, yes, as a deduction to capitalized -- to taxable income.","David Bryan Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","And remind me, have you made any commitments with regard to the common dividend as we go forward beyond the split?","Steven Roth","We have said in the material that we put out and in the call that the combined dividend from the -- SpinCo and RemainCo Will not be less than the dividend that is the currently being paid by Vornado.","Operator","Our last question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mitchell, just on the space taking out for redevelopment in Crystal City, so that went up by 45,000 square feet sequentially. I already thought 221 South Clark, the WeWork lease, was already in that, so I didn't know what caused that increase, about 48,000 square feet?","Mitchell N. Schear","You're -- so if you take the total square footage of the building, the building in through March of 2014 was half occupied. So the balance of the building was taken out. I think the square footage that you're then specifically referring to, about half of that was related to BRAC lease, and half of it was non-BRAC space. Does that answer your question?","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So going from 340 to 393 was the fact that the leases hadn't rolled yet at the end of 2013, and as those leases rolled, it was taken out for redevelopment.","Mitchell N. Schear","That's correct.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Is there any more -- out of the balance of the 1.2 million square feet to be resolved, is any more moving up to the redevelopment piece?","Mitchell N. Schear","We don't anticipate any other space being moved into that redevelopment category.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just sticking with Mitchell, we talked a lot about this uptick in activity, and you went through all the significant tech initiatives that you have going on, and the WeWork stuff. Is there anything else? And you talked about the associations. Is there anything else from -- because the leases pending really didn't shift that much in terms of sort of pipeline of leasing that could support other than the things that you had discussed. Is there anything -- any other color in terms of these negotiations that support that comment about uptick in activity and that you really see this end of year pick up?","Mitchell N. Schear","So what I would say is, if you think of the legs of the Crystal City stool, there really are a number of them. So you'll still see government activity as one of the demand drivers, notwithstanding all that we've read and heard about government, there will be government activity. There will be government contractor activity. So if you think of that as a second leg. If you think of the third leg, as we talked about, there's a variety of the non-for-profits and some of the value-driven tenants, Crystal City becomes an incredibly great value proposition to some space in downtown Washington or some of the other submarket. And then if you add the new layer that we've been discussing in terms of some of the creative types as well as the tech types, we think that there is demand from that sector, and we're sort of adding another layer to the whole puzzle. But at the end of the day, I think we'll see activity come from a variety of those sectors.","Steven Roth","But Michael, those are the things that Mitchell and the team are doing to attract tenants and to make Crystal City the more -- place making in Crystal City and what have you. But more directly to your question, there are more showings, there are more inquiries, there is more life, there's more activity, including a couple of fairly large 0.5 million square foot folks that are cruising around looking to either buy or to rent. So there is activity, whereas 2 years ago, there was almost -- the phone didn't ring. Now the phone is ringing.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then, Steve, just last question for you. In early March, you announced the Springfield transaction with PREIT. It was structured with big upfront cash payment and then stock or units from a tax perspective. Since doing that deal, PREIT stock has come off about $2. It's sitting $1.50 below the collared price of $18.50 that you had struck to provide security for Vornado shareholders given the fact that the deal was struck at $20, but you protected your shareholders down to $18.50. I'm just curious, you're going to be a 10% holder of PREIT. The market reaction to that transaction has wiped off almost $140 million of market cap to them. And I'm just curious, it's a great deal for Vornado, but you're also a shareholder. I'm just trying to figure out how you think about it today and...","Steven Roth","I'll tell you how we think about it. So first thing is, is that if we were not exiting the mall business, which we are, we would not have sold this asset, okay? So we have high aspirations for this asset. We like the asset. And as I said, we would not be selling this asset other than the fact that we really are exiting the mall business for lots of different reasons, okay? So that's step one. Step two is, is that, I think I said a little while ago on the call, you really have to kick the tires and see the real estate and walk the real estate to appreciate what it is. And so, I myself was in Springfield exactly 1 week ago last Tuesday. I was sort of work -- I worked the asset and spent several hours down there. It is spectacular. It is a huge asset. It has great bones. The esthetics of it are terrific. The design of it is terrific. It's a big, impressive, imposing asset in a very underserved niche in the Washington market and we believe we'll do extremely well. So that's the second. So it's a real McCoy. The third part of the asset is that the first run of leasing of the asset -- by the way, we took this asset down to the steel, and we moved half of the steel around. We left the anchor standing. The other thing to note is if when you go down there and inspect the asset, which I hope you all do, you will see that Vornado over-built this asset. We spent I think, knowledgeably, I'm going to guess $15 million more on this asset than I think a normal developer would have done. By the way, we did the same thing with the Bloomberg, and you see how that worked out. We're doing the same thing with 220 Central Park South, and you see how that works out. So creating great physical assets is really important. So anyway. So -- the mark -- we believe that the income on stabilization will be in the high-20s, and based upon the purchased price that PREIT is paying this asset, that translates to a scant 6%. I don't know whether 5.5%, 5.7%, 5.8%. I don't know what that will be on stabilization, okay? We believe, Vornado believes, that this asset will stabilize on the second roll, which happens in the seventh, eighth, ninth, 10th year at the better part of $40 million if it performs in the midrange of what our expectation is, which will turn out to be an 8-plus cap on what the purchase price is. And so we believe that there is an enormous potential profit in this asset for Mr. and Mrs. PREIT. Furthermore, there's 3 million square feet of peripheral development entitlements in this property, which are not right now, but will be right somewhere over the 10 year cycle. So we think -- I mean, look, we are -- we're happy to sell it. We sold it with our eyes open. We think that we made a fair sale. We think the buyer made a fair buy, all things considered. And so we think that the market is -- the market's always right. But we're actually quite surprised that the reaction in the market to -- in PREIT's stock. We expect the transaction to close. If it closes and we're below the collar, we will suffer a relatively modest loss of a $1 a share or whatever it might be. We're happy -- we're not happy, but we'll do that. That's what the deal is. So the long and the short of it now, From PREIT's point of view, they have 3 or 4 or 5 different options, okay? The first option is they can tough it out and try to continue to run their business and try to explain to their investors why they made the transaction or why they think it's good for their company. And by the way, I was on the asset on site Tuesday, I understand that the day before, that's a week ago, Monday, the CEO of PREIT was there with 3 of his investors, touring the asset as well. And that's his job and I think that's the right thing. So that's the first thing. The second thing they can do is take your suggestion in PREIT's last call, Michael, and default and leave them with the $46 million deposit and walk away. If that happens from -- by the way, we have no expectation that, that would happen. That would not be a good thing for anybody. If that happens, we will be fine. We'll figure that out, okay, although we don't expect that to happen at all. The third thing is, is they can take an investor into that -- into the Springfield asset, which is a possibility. The next thing they can do is they can say, \"Well, gee, this is kind of silly. Let's buyback some stock.\" So they have lots of different things that they can do. And I'm pretty confident that they're very alert, very attentive, and thinking about this very hard. Vornado is supportive of the deal. Vornado is happy to own the $125 million stake in their company. And Vornado is supportive of PREIT.","I think that's the end of the queue?

These documents as well as our supplemental financial information package are available on our website www.vno.com under the Investor Relations section.","In these documents and during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release Form 10-Q and financial supplement. Please be aware that statements made during this call maybe deemed forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.","Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our Form 10-K for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. The call may include time-sensitive information that maybe accurate only as of today's date. The company does not undertake the duty to update any forward-looking statements.","On the call today from management for our opening comments is Michael Franco President. In addition, Steven Roth and our senior team are present and available for questions.","I will now turn the call over to Michael Franco.","Michael Franco","Thank you, Cathy, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a few comments on our second quarter financial results before giving some thoughts on the markets and our portfolio and the important new disclosure we provided on our Penn District redevelopments in our earnings release and supplement.","While FFO as adjusted on a GAAP basis for the second quarter was $0.91 per share $0.07 lower than last year's second quarter, cash basis FFO was up 2.1% reflecting the underlying strength of our core business with strong same-store results, which I will review shortly.","Let me explain the GAAP numbers as they contain a little noise. First, this year so far we have sold assets which aggregated almost $3 billion. Notably, the 45.4% stake in our Upper Fifth Avenue and Times Square assets and our stock interest in Lexington Realty Trust and Urban Edge Properties. Even though these sales were applauded by all and they were done at NAV and should have been accretive to our share price earnings go down as a result.","As an aside, we were surprised and disappointed by the stock market's ho-hum reaction. FFO decreased by $10 million, or $0.05 per share in the second quarter, due to these sales partially offset by $5 million, or $0.02 per share of interest savings from the retirement of the 5% $400 million unsecured notes, so that accounts for a $0.03 per share net decrease.","Next, FFO was reduced by almost $0.02 per share from the non-cash impact of one-time equity award issued to the new leadership group, net of the savings from the accelerated vesting of restrictive stock awards in the first quarter. We also had a couple of retail tenant issues impact our second quarter results.","At the end of June, Topshop closed all its U.S. stores including our two locations at 608 Fifth Avenue and 478 Broadway following the Topshop U.S. retail operating entity being placed in U.K. administration and the commencement by the U.K. administrators of a Chapter 15 case in New York. While we were paid rent to the end of June, we wrote-off the straight-line rent balances associated with this tenant. The increase in the straight-line write-offs in this year's second quarter over last year's second quarter amounted to $9.9 million, or $0.05 per share, which is included in both same-store NOI and comparable FFO results, primarily attributable to Topshop at Broadway.","We treated as non-comparable the write-off at 608 Fifth Avenue of the straight-line rent and the right of use asset at this location. Under the new lease accounting standard on January 1, of this year we recorded as an asset the present value of the rents we pay under this 14-year non-recourse building and ground lease. We have the right to cancel this non-recourse ground lease.","In terms of the bottom line impact of Topshop, upon such cancellation of the ground lease at 608 Fifth Avenue, we will no longer have the asset. And in such event FFO will be permanently reduced by $10 million per year, which will nick our NAV by roughly $1 per share. At 478 Broadway, FFO will be temporarily reduced by $8 million per year from the vacancy. This is great space, which we will release in the ordinary course. We may convert some of the upper floors to office given the attractiveness of this bull's eye location in SoHo to creative types.","So to summarize, the aggregate of all these items that affected second quarter comparable results was a $0.10 per share decrease. This was partially offset by $0.03 of growth in the core business, which I will cover in a minute.","In our July 12 press release, we covered the details of the non-comparable items in the quarter, which includes a $2.559 billion net gain on the retail joint venture, the previously discussed non-cash charge on 608 Fifth Avenue, which was $77.2 million, and an $88.9 million after-tax net gain on unit closings at 220 Central Park South. Speaking of 220 Central Park South, sales continue apace. To-date, we have closed on 38 units for net proceeds of $1.03 billion, and earlier this month paid off the remainder of the $950 million loan. The property is now debt-free.","Closings will continue throughout 2019 and 2020. And importantly, from here, we will retain all future net proceeds, which will be redeployed primarily into the Penn District redevelopments turning this capital into highly accretive ratings.","On July 11, just after the close of the second quarter, we sold our interest \u2013 our 25% interest in 330 Madison Avenue to our partner at a $900 million valuation, netting us approximately $100 million after our share of the mortgage. This asset was the subject of a buy-sell. And at the pricing offered, we concluded it was a better sale than a buy.","Over our 20-year hold period, we made eight times our investment. And by the way, we have quite a few like this. The taxable gain related to this sale coming on top of the big retail deal will increase the special dividend requirement at year-end, which as of now looks like it will be approximately $1.75 per share.","To give you some visibility into comparable FFO for the second half of the year, the aforementioned asset sales after the unsecured note repayment will reduce FFO by approximately $21 million, or $0.10 per share and the lost rent from Topshop will reduce FFO by approximately $13 million, or $0.06 per share. We expect 2019 will represent a trough year for comparable FFO per share.","As we continually say cash NOI is the most important metric in our business. That's how real estate is traditionally valued. Company-wide our second quarter cash basis, same-store NOI increased by a healthy 4.3% broken down as follows: New York office was up 3.3%; Street retail was up 4.2%; theMART was up 15.5%; and 555 California Street was up 12.9%.","Let me now turn to the New York market. New York's deep pool of talent and the fact that they want to live and work here coupled with record venture capital investment has led to enormous technology sector employment growth of 80% since 2009. This has played an important role in attracting large tech tenants to the city and continues to feed their insatiable appetite to grow their footprints in Manhattan.","These tenant funnel they want to be in New York, they need to be in New York. Just think of the names in the last 90 days who have either committed or are actively looking for space. It's a Who's Who. In fact, almost all the well-managed companies in every other industry are copying this template in their efforts to attract the best talent.","As a result, the New York City economy continues to enjoy sustained job growth, driving strong tenant demand for office space. Private sector jobs increased 54,000 in the first six months as compared to 76,000 for all of 2018 with six-month office sector jobs increasing 12,000 as compared to 20,000 again for all of 2018. Overall, our office portfolio is in great shape and continues to perform well.","Occupancy stands at 96.7% with only 132,000 square feet of remaining expirations in 2019. Our Midtown portfolio, which has been completely modernized and redeveloped for the long-term remains very resilient and highly sought after by tenants. In the second quarter, our leasing team completed 221,000 square feet of office leases and 29 separate transactions in New York at a very healthy average starting rent of $83.54 per square foot.","Our mark-to-market rents were positive 3.3% cash and 5.9% GAAP. While the first half leasing activity of 617,000 square feet is on the wider side for us historically, realistically our portfolio is substantially full. But there is more to the story. We have a robust leasing pipeline with more than two million square feet of deals in various stages of negotiation. We are experiencing strong leasing activity across all submarkets from tenants in all industry sectors. We have our first leases out at the recently delivered 512 West 22nd Street including one with a leading media company all at triple-digit rents.","Now turning to the next major driver of growth and value creation in our business the Penn District. First and most importantly, yesterday we published on page 8 of our earnings release and page 30 of our supplement the projected costs and returns for the Farley Building PENN1 and PENN2 redevelopments. In total, these three projects comprised 5.2 million square feet consisting of an 845,000 square foot new build at Farley and 4.3 million square feet of renovated and new space at PENN1 and PENN2. The redevelopments will be transformative for these buildings and for the district overall. Please see our latest renderings and videos of these projects on our website.","We are projecting to spend $2.2 billion to redevelop these assets along with other district-wide improvements of which we have spent $514 million to date. We project these redevelopments will generate $183 million of incremental cash NOI on stabilization, a very strong 8.3% initial stabilized yield on costs. This is before ground lease rent reset on PENN1 in 2023, which will be comfortably absorbed by that asset's increased NOI.","Overall, we expect to replace $60 plus per square foot office rents at PENN1 and PENN2 with $90 plus per square foot rents and expect to achieve triple-digit rents at Farley. These redevelopments will begin to contribute to earnings in 2022 and accelerate over time as the projects are finished and leased up. As we have mentioned previously, the capital for these projects will be funded from the net proceeds of 220 Central Park South without the need for any new debt, which will be very accretive to earnings. We expect that this will put our earnings growth at the head of the pack.","Notably, the projected returns in these projects do not include the knock on effects on all of our other existing assets in the Penn District and the multiple additional development opportunities we control. All will clearly benefit enormously. As the Penn District transformation takes hold, we believe that the Hotel Pennsylvania will be one of the best development sites in the city.","Once redeveloped, we are confident the Penn District, which is located directly on top of all major transportation serving the city and region will become the heart of the new West Side where companies will plant their flag in order to attract and retain talent by creating new workplace environments in our buildings.","Looking towards 2020, our lease expiration stands at 1.1 million square feet with 560,000 of this amount coming at PENN2, primarily McGraw-Hill, which will be taken out of service as this redevelopment kicks into high gear. It is here at PENN1 and PENN2 where we are creating a unique campus and we'll be providing today's workforce with the office of tomorrow.","The scale of our 4.3 million square foot campus at these buildings enables us to provide our tenants with an unrivaled amenity package. These buildings will operate and feel much like a full service hotel with fitness and wellness centers, conferencing facilities, large town hall spaces, food and beverage facilities as well as many communal spaces to work alongside colleagues.","Anticipating our redevelopment program, during the second quarter, we signed a 38,000 square foot lease at PENN1 with a Fortune 200 company at a starting rent of $93 per square foot a sign of things to come. This is a first-generation lease. If this lease would have been included in our mark-to-markets the mark-to-market for New York Office would have been approximately 20% on a cash basis.","In addition, both at Farley and PENN2, we are deep in negotiations with multiple large users for anchor spaces all in the triple digits. All of this validates the unique nature of what we're delivering here and our underwritten pricing for space in the new Penn District.","In addition to the capital, we are spending in the Penn District, the government is also investing an estimated $3 billion on various infrastructure improvements including the Moynihan Train Hall, the West End Concourse, 34th Street subway station improvements and the new 33rd Street train station entrance.","In addition, we have entered into a memorandum of understanding with New York State to redevelop the Long Island Rail Road Concourse under PENN1. This redevelopment will tie together Seventh and Eighth Avenues underground, dramatically widen the corridor and raise the ceiling height allow natural light into the Concourse and substantially improve the user experience. Overall, we couldn't be more excited about what we're doing here.","At theMART in Chicago, occupancy was 94.8% at quarter end. We have strong leasing activity with term sheets in negotiation for much of the 125,000 square feet of vacant space on floors four and five in addition to discussions with two large tenants regarding early renewals fueled by their expansion needs.","During the quarter we completed 30,000 square feet of showroom leases at an average starting rent of $63.83 per square foot. Our mark-to-market rents were positive 6% cash and 14.9% GAAP. At our 555 California Street complex in San Francisco we are 100% leased. During the quarter, we completed a 30,000 square foot renewal, with one of our blue chip financial services tenants at an initial starting rent of $86 per square foot. Our mark-to-market rents were positive 12.8% cash and 32.2% GAAP. As an aside, we believe rents at 555 California are under market by, say, 25% which will result in continued strong growth over the next few years as leases roll.","Finally turning now to our New York Street Retail business. Overall, the retail market continues to be challenging with leasing velocity slow and assets prone to negative surprises, \u00e0 la Topshop. I will also point out Forever 21 has hired restructuring advisers and is working with the mall owners to provide rent relief to help stabilize the company.","They are a continuing tenant of ours at 1540 Broadway and 435 Seventh Avenue. Their lease at 4 Union Square expires this November and we chose not to renew them. We have released a portion to Whole Foods for an expansion of its store and are actively negotiating to release the balance of their space at higher rents. 435 Seventh Avenue is a new five-year lease where they recently opened. At 1540 Broadway, we will likely participate with the mall owners for rent relief in some small measure.","Retail occupancy was 94.7% at quarter end down from 97.1% last quarter, all due to Topshop and the Four Seasons restaurant. In the second quarter, we leased a total of 70,000 square feet of retail space, achieving mark-to-markets of 18.7% cash and 44.4% GAAP. The highlight was the significant 20-year 61,000 square foot renewal and expansion with Whole Foods at 4 Union Square South, the premier asset in that submarket. They are enlarging and remodeling this high volume store.","To conclude, we continue to maintain a fortress balance sheet with reasonable leverage and an abundance of liquidity today and growing over the next few years. Our current liquidity is $3.77 billion, comprised of $1.1 billion in cash, restricted cash and securities and $2.6 billion undrawn on our revolving credit facilities.","With that I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Each caller will be allowed to ask question and a follow-up question, before we move to the next caller. The first caller in the queue is from Manny Korchman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Manny Korchman","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Michael, I think you mentioned that 2019 would be a trough year for FFO, just given the bigger move-outs like McGraw-Hill and some of the retail vacancies that are going to come into the year. Can you walk us through why 2020 wouldn't dip versus 2019?","Michael Franco","Joe?","Joe Macnow","Manny, it's Joe. Our forecast shows a substantial recruitment of this year's diminution next year. So when you did that pencil to paper and took Michael's one-timers that affect the rest of this year that puts our comparable FFO in the $1.40 somewhere -- I'm sorry $3.40, somewhere around there. Our projections are next year, notwithstanding that, a bigger piece of 2 Penn will be out of service, it's greater than that. Don't forget, we have two of the other West Side assets coming back into service. We have growth in the core business. We have steps. We have many pluses offsetting those minuses.","Manny Korchman","Thank you, Joe. And then, on Farley it looks like the costs sort of on a pro forma basis ticked up versus where you had them the last time you talked about cost. Can you tell us what's going into that project that\u2019s maybe taking a little bit more money to get done?","Michael Franco","So, Manny, look, we probably could have done a little bit better, given the road map here. But I think the short answer is that, the costs we publish now include the initial land contribution of $230 million, plus the amount we paid related, which was I think $41.5 million. So when you take the previous costs, which when you gross it up was $800 million, plus the $230 million, plus related et cetera, you essentially get back to the number we publish now. There are some minor scope changes, but net-net you're pretty close with all those additions.","Manny Korchman","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. I guess I wanted to first touch on kind of the ground lease at 1 Penn. I know you probably can't get into a lot of detail. But could you -- just whatever you can sort of tell us me about, maybe, what you're paying today and maybe how we think about the fair market value reset. And then, are there any other ground leases in the next say 10 or 15 years that have any kind of renewals or resets that we should be aware of?","Joe Macnow","The current rent at 1 Penn is $2.5 million. The reset is in 2023. The term of that lease goes all the way out to 2098, so it is a true -- truly a long-term control over the land. It's a fairly standard fair market value reset and we don't really have very much else to say about the -- where we'll end up. One thing is that, if you look at 1 Penn as an asset, the income is in round numbers, the better part of $100 million today. We project that that income is going to go up by another $40 million $50 million-odd as a result of the redevelopment and neighborhood improvements.","So somewhere around the reset date, the income will be on that building somewhere around $140 million $150 million maybe a pinch less maybe a pinch more, so that that asset can easily and comfortably withstand an increase in the land value. We have three other ground leases that I can recall. We have one at 330 West 34th Street, which has a reset coming up in 2020, which will be it's a small asset so whatever the rent reset might be it's going to be immaterial. We have another one at 888 Seventh Avenue which comes out for a reset at the end of the decade of -- late in the 2020s. And we have a third ground lease at 909 Third Avenue which has an expiry of when David?","David Greenbaum","2063. Flat.","Joe Macnow","2063. And that is flat from now there are no resets whatever. And the rent is an extraordinarily low and favorable number. One comment about the ground lease reset process. There are plenty of these kicking around. And the recent resets over the last year or two have been in my mind pretty stupid. I mean you just take the Barney's reset and take a look at that that has basically -- the numbers had no reality and basically will bankrupt Mr. Barney's. So, we believe that there will be more reality in the reset process coming -- going forward.","The issue that really caused the issue and the problem is that retail rents went crazy and therefore land for retail became extremely inflated, hyperinflated a bubble. And similarly, the condo market went crazy and that was a bubble. Those -- we expect those two bubbles are coming out of the market. So we can -- so the answer is that we believe that the resets will be more realistic, whatever they happen to be, we can handle economically easily. And I think that's a pretty fulsome explanation Steve.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thank you. And then I guess the second question just to kind of circle back on kind of McGraw-Hill and some of the move-outs. As we think about two PENN going into kind of redevelopment, you're showing about 1.3 million square feet in service of the kind of 1.6 million. Outside of the McGraw-Hill space coming off-line, is there really any other space in that building that needs to come off-line for you to effectuate this redevelopment?","Steven Roth","Joe, you have an answer for that one?","Joe Macnow","So Steve, you were right without getting too specific we did disclose almost 300,000 square feet out of service today. We project that will go up to about 0.5 million feet at the end of this year. It will go up in 2020 as more of the building is taken out of service. Approximately two-thirds of the building will be taken out of service at peak. And then of course start to come back in as the offices are filled the top two floors are rented et cetera, et cetera.","Steven Roth","So -- but look Steve, I know you can't do this because I know modeling is the essence of what you do. But I would ask you to look at the real estate business that we're in from a different point of view, okay? We will be taking this building and we will be transforming the building from $60 rents to $90 and $100 rents, okay. We will be taking the building which has -- is long of tooth and bringing it into the modern age and making it be one of the most competitive buildings in terms of a work environment for our tenants, okay. We believe that this will be extremely -- an extremely profitable activity. And I'm not even getting into how it will help to transform the entire neighborhood. It's an enormous undertaking. The building has 400-odd feet of frontage on Seventh Avenue from 31st Street to 33rd Street, all of which will look totally different when we complete it. You've seen the pictures. I'm sure you've seen the pictures.","So this will be -- in the interim, while we do our work, it will have a slight dilution, but the objective is to convert $60 space to $90 space which will be extremely accretive to earnings and NAV when we complete this in just a few years. So, I know that you have to be extremely interested and model what happens month by month and quarter by quarter. Our perspective is on the endgame as to what the product will look like when they're done and how it will increase our earnings and our NAV.","Furthermore, the market is -- has been -- the market, the tenants and brokers community have been extensively exposed to the product and they love it. And the example of which is, is that we are going to lease now with the first very large anchor tenant at a triple-digit number. So, the building will be a success. It is a success and just while you have to model take a look at the long view, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. The next question in queue comes from James Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","James Feldman","Great. Thank you and good morning. I was just hoping to dig a little deeper into your yield assumptions. Can you just talk about kind of what gives you comfort on those rents and what the leasing pipeline looks like in detail for these projects?","Steven Roth","We have -- Michael did a great job. Michael, thank you. I thank you for multiple reasons, okay. First you did a great job and second of all I didn't do it. So Michael said in his remarks that we have executed a lease with a Fortune 200 company, so a large important company at PENN2 at $93...","Michael Franco","PENN1. PENN1.","Steven Roth","I'm sorry at PENN1 pardon me. At PENN1 for $93 a foot. Now obviously that's a significant gap from the market value or the perceived market value of the building today. The reason for that is that this tenant and the community believe in what we're doing and is willing to pay a fair price. So, we believe the market price for the buildings with -- as we lease it up now and as we complete our redevelopment is well into the 90s, okay. So think about where it is. Okay. We are in the West side of New York which is the hottest area of New York. And we're directly on top of the transportation network. So we have that as a -- for a skeptic we have that as a validation.","In PENN2, we have as validation that we are going to lease with an anchor tenant at a triple-digit number. With respect to Farley, we are in the market. I think one of the analysts wrote in a report that I read overnight that his -- while, we haven't announced any leasing at Farley, his broker checks indicate that there is intense activity on the building. That is correct. The activity is at triple digits. And that's all -- I think that's all we have to say about these important negotiations going on in Farley. So we have our view. We have the market's view. We have lead tenants executing leases at our underwritten numbers. By the way there's nothing that says that we won't exceed our underwriting.","James Feldman","Okay. Thank you. Could you talk about operating expenses in those buildings and whether they'll change post renovation?","Steven Roth","Somebody has going to have to do that other than me.","Joe Macnow","I mean, I think Jamie our general view is that -- not meaningfully right? There's -- we're, obviously, expanding and dramatically enhancing the plazas et cetera. So at PENN1 there's probably a little bit additional increase from an OpEx standpoint, obviously, taxes go up in proportion with rents. But from an OpEx standpoint, I think the answer is not meaningfully other than maybe a little bit on PENN1.","Steven Roth","Let me handle the question slightly differently. The increase in space rent that we are underwriting almost all of it will drop to the bottom. What will not drop is a marginal increase in taxes and the maintenance expense of the building will remain basically the same. The building is the building. The cleaning is the cleaning. The common area is in the common area.","So we believe that almost all of call it 90% or whatever of the increase in space rent will go to -- will drop the FFO. By the way that's an important comment. I say drop the FFO because there will be no interest against any of this incremental increase in income because we are funding it with cash coming in from 220 and other places off our balance sheet with no new debt between them, which is an extraordinary thing.","James Feldman","Okay. Thank you. Do I get another or that counted as my second?","Steven Roth","What's that?","James Feldman","Do I get another question or that counted as my second?","Steven Roth","Yes sir.","James Feldman","So can you just talk about anyway TopShop bankruptcy? Just some thoughts on credit risk in the retail portfolio going forward?","Steven Roth","Well the first thing is that somebody asked the question about what -- whether -- who's on our watch list and the answer is everybody is on our watch list. So that's the way we run the business.","The second thing is by and large, almost all of the retailers that we do business with are large and important creditworthy companies. The issue is not their creditworthiness, although TopShop was obviously an issue. And Forever 21 by the way is a little shaky. But the issue really is like what happens when the leases expire. So the answer is that we have few retailers of course as everybody does. But by and large the credit of the portfolio is pretty cool.","James Feldman","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from John Kim with BMO. Please proceed.","John Kim","Thank you. On the incremental cash yield of 8.3% at PENN, can you clarify what -- how you calculate that number? Is it new rent over incremental cost, or is it the incremental rent over the incremental cost?","Michael Franco","It's basically the -- Farley is a new build, right? So that's NOI over the budget. And then for the balance, it's the incremental NOI over the costs to be spent.","John Kim","Okay. So the numerator would be the $30 difference in rents between 60 and 90 that lies over there?","Michael Franco","That's right.","John Kim","Okay.","Michael Franco","That's right. The sense is decent, right? It's the incremental rents multiplied by the square footage. Obviously we're adding some square footage at PENN2 with the addition of the bustle and then converting some of the top two floors from mechanical to office. But excepting that it's the incremental rent with a slight leakage for taxes and OpEx.","John Kim","Okay, great. Thank you. And can you also describe what is in the $100 million of district-wide improvements? Are those investments in your assets or is that infrastructure cost basically?","Steven Roth","Principally common area in between the buildings the -- putting -- plazas and plinths in the common areas and not inside the building. So it's principally exterior work. It includes safety bollards, it includes some other miscellaneous improvements in connecting the building.","John Kim","Has that increased more than you expected or was that within budget?","Steven Roth","This is the first time that we had published anything about this. And it was -- we thought it was appropriate to list it in the budgeting that we released, but we can't allocate it and we didn't allocate it to any specific building. We didn't allocate a return on it either, so we just put it in together as part of the net -- as part of the neighborhood block.","Joe Macnow","And, of course, John it's Joe. We gave you the yield on the total cost inclusive of that.","John Kim","All right. Very helpful. Thank you.","Joe Macnow","Yes sir.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks for taking the question. So just around Street retail, you had cash NOI of about $66 million this quarter. And if I adjust for the full quarterly impact of the JV, it's probably closer to the $60 million, maybe low $60 million. Given sort of all the move-outs you mentioned and the potential moving pieces including Forever 21, how should we think about a run rate heading into 2020? I know you've given some -- you had given disclosure earlier. But just now post the JV in the numbers, how should we think about the run rate even if there's a range you can provide that will be helpful going into 2020.","Steven Roth","Vikram give me the question again please.","Vikram Malhotra","Your Street retail cash NOI was $66 million this quarter. But if I adjust for the full quarter because the JV occurred in April, mid-April. So if I adjust for that, I think your cash NOI should be closer to the low $60 million range. But if we look forward, you talked about TopShop, Forever 21 potentially just looking at\u2026?","Steven Roth","Okay. I got it, I got it. Thank you. So let me give you some numbers, which may -- which I think is a direct -- a very direct answer to your question. Last year, we gave guidance on the retail income. We started out with a $304 million number. We then raised it to $309 million as a result of some space at 770 Broadway coming out of the Kmart store and another retail lease that was converted from the retail segment and the office segments. So we then got up to $309 million. In midyear, we -- is it the other way around?","Joe Macnow","Yes. It's the other way around.","Steven Roth","Oh gosh.","Joe Macnow","Even I went to $304 million.","Steven Roth","So we started out with $309 million. We reduced it to $304 million because we took space out of the retail segment into the office segment. We then raised it to $315 million on performance during the year. And we ended up the year at $324 million on performance. So that's the starting point. Okay?","The retail JV, which we believe was a monumentally -- a monumental deal, a superb execution and very important, okay, Will reduce the running rate NOI of the retail segment by $84 million, okay.","And that basically is simplistically taking the income that was included in that venture, and saying we lose 45% of it. Now, that's not an economically good number because that is offset by the proceeds, the cash that we got and the huge preferred dividend that we're getting et cetera.","So but that is just -- if you just look at the retail segment that's our number. The Topshop so that's an $84 million deduct. The Topshop, the two stores in Topshop that left will nick the income stream by a running -- or an annual running rate of $17 million.","So if you take those $324 million which was the actual, less $84 million which is the loss of the 45% of the JV retail less $17 million for the two TopShops you get to a $223 million number, okay?","I'm not comfortable with that number. But I am comfortable with something in the low 200s. So that's where we think, that that will go. Now understand this is only the retail segment.","It doesn't account for several ins and outs on the financial side of our balance sheet et cetera, so that the economic number is actually much higher. But anyway that's the way -- that's where we see it.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay.","Steven Roth","And Vikram, Joe, is going to prove my answer.","Joe Macnow","Just to clarify, two things. When you look at Steve's Chairman, letter as it was amended he talked about $109 million if $84 million, is the retail piece of that.","Vikram Malhotra","Yes, the retail. Got it, and then the $223 million that may be adjusted, I mean, I'm assuming there is no assumption there for potentially the -- per the Massimo space or any other of the -- like the Madison Avenue assets.","This $223 million just as the math that you gave, there's no other assumption behind those two...","Steven Roth","Vikram, when I went to $223 million. And I said, I'm not comfortable with that number yet. But I'm low comfortable in the low 200s...","Vikram Malhotra","Low -- okay got it.","Steven Roth","That in my mind for move ins, move outs and other things that may happen, which will affect it but not in a significant amount.","Vikram Malhotra","Got it, okay, and then just a bigger picture question, okay.","Steven Roth","Yes, sir.","Vikram Malhotra","Just a bigger, just a bigger picture question, you sort of mentioned or I think maybe Michael mentioned you were disappointed with sort of the ho-hum sort of reaction to the retail JV which, was indeed very good execution.","I'm just sort of thinking bigger picture, either similar to -- are you thinking about similar structures on the office side or tactically, strategically, anything else just to kind of start to close this NAV gap?","I know you have a lot operationally going on. But just more strategically, anything else you can sort of offer in terms of thoughts around closing the NAV gap?","Steven Roth","There is obviously we were extremely disappointed with the reaction to the retail there which we thought was a spectacular deal. And a spectacular execution in a challenging market.","And obviously, we continue to work away at all -- many different alternatives to create value, nothing that we are prepared to discuss today or hint that or get into.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. And no changes on the buyback in your -- from your perspective on a buyback?","Steven Roth","Since you mentioned it, let's spend a second on buyback. So I wrote extensively about it in my shareholder's letter 18 months ago. And there's a paragraph in there on page 30 \u2026","Joe Macnow","\u202623.","Steven Roth","23 of that letter that if you have a mind go back and reread it. But basically what it says is that buybacks are very useful, if you have -- if they are funded out of a recurring, stream of earnings on which you can continuously do it.","And there's lots of Fortune 500 companies that -- are in continuous buyback mode, but they are doing out of retained earnings, recurring retained earnings. We don't have that. So we have to do it out of -- basically off of our balance sheet by selling assets or whatever.","So -- and I think, I said in my letter that, if we did a $1 billion buyback it would increase our NAV by maybe -- for the remaining shareholders, by maybe $1.5 or some such number. And that our management or our Board would rather have the $1 billion that the $1.5 NAV increase when we're already selling at some huge number below NAV.","But now there's a better way to look at it. Okay? So when I said if we used -- if we took cash off our balance sheet or we sold an asset or whatever it is and we bought back our shares.","My math is -- is that, for every $1 billion that we would do it we would increase, NAV to the remaining shareholders by $1.5. But we're not doing that. We may do it, but we're not doing that.","What we are doing is, we're going to spend $1 billion at an 18.3% return on our own assets. And that doesn't take the knock-on effect of the value we will create on the building sets around the buildings that we are redeveloping at Penn Plaza.","Now if you take that math, if you can invest the $1 billion at 8% that generates $80 million of income. At a 4.5% cap rate that's $1.7 billion of value creation. That $1.7 billion divided by 200-odd million shares is rounded $9 a share.","So, would you rather invest $1 billion in buying back your stock, where by the way the $1 billion goes away you lose the liquidity and you increase your NAV by $1.5 or would you rather invest it in the buildings, where you will be creating $9 a share for the remaining shareholders of NAV? I don't think that's a difficult question.","Now what's more, when we get done with this, we will have a Farley with no debt whatsoever, we will have One Penn with no debt whatsoever. And Two Penn with debt of about $500 million, which is debt that is on there now and we're not going to increase.","So with those three buildings alone, there are multiple billions of dollars of additional liquidity available to the company for whatever corporate purpose we have. So, we think that our -- we're on the right track here. We're not inflexible.","Vikram Malhotra","Fair enough, thanks. Fair enough that's fair.","Steven Roth","Hang on, hang on. I'm not done yet. Okay?","Vikram Malhotra","Oh! Sorry.","Steven Roth","We're not inflexible. And we think we get what we try to learn. One of our pals is doing a buyback, okay? Very committed to it, okay? It hasn't worked yet. But if it -- if as and when it does work, we will learn from that, okay?","But as of right now, we would rather invest a couple of billion dollars on our own assets. And create $150-odd million of new earnings, rather than buying back our stock. That's where we are.","Vikram Malhotra","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from John Guinee with Stifel. Please proceed.","John Guinee","Well, thank you for all the information on PENN Station, PENN District campus. I'm convinced, it's going to be a spectacular product. Steve, why would anybody want to be in Hudson Yards or Manhattan West, if they can be at PENN Station?","Joe Macnow","Welcome to the team John.","Steven Roth","Hey John, that's not a serious question. But the answer to that is first of all look, my pal Steve Ross did a great job and Jeff and the boys they did a great job at Hudson Yards. I mean, all of our friends that are in developing in our neighborhood, we're all friends. It all plays off each other. It all makes the entire district of the west side of Manhattan better, okay?","So I'm not sure that we would be able to -- no I am sure. I am sure that we would not be able to create the value that we are going to create at our Penn Plaza assets had not Hudson Yards preceded us. So that's just one.","By the way John since I got you, you wrote something on June 12 and normally I'm not about what you write, okay? But this one I'm going to read out loud because I love you, okay? You said on June 12, expect Phase one of Penn Plaza to be extremely well done, sparing no expense to create a transformative environment and a landmark on the west side. We expect the finished product to be completely different than the current landscape. The costs and return on costs -- the costs and return on costs are as of now unknown, but now you'll know them by the way. So anyway thank you for that. We appreciate your support.","John Guinee","Thank you. Can I ask one more question?","Steven Roth","No. I'm going to stop while I'm at it. Go ahead.","John Guinee","Okay. So Farley, $1220 a square foot, if you take out the land and the payment to relaid it about $900 a foot. Manhattan, what I understand x the land newbuild is about $1200 to $1300 a foot. But your budget for PENN2 is only $416 a foot. And it seems to me just kind of difficult to demo down to the frame, beef up the steel all new skin couple of hundred thousand square feet of new space, elevators MEP TI lease and commission soft costs for $416 a foot seems like a really low number. Is that fair?","Steven Roth","No, it's not a low number. It's an accurate number. So let me give you, barely wish you -- hang on. I'm looking for something here in a big stack of paper. So here is our budget, okay? So the $750 million now remember that doesn't include Farley because we're basically funding it with cash, okay?","So our budget in the round numbers is that, we're going to be creating 90,000 square feet call it 100,000 square feet of new space in the bustle and at the top of the building where we're converting mechanical space into a highly leasable, a triple-digit rent space. And adding round, round numbers there's a couple of hundred million dollars, okay?","We're going to skin the building. We're not taking it down to the frame, we're going to take portions of the frame off and reimage it. We're going to skin the building and put a new beautiful glass front on it. And that in round numbers is $200 million in our budget. That budget also includes the heating and convectors at the glass -- or at the perimeter of the building, okay?","So there's $200 million to create new space which is income-producing and return space and there's a good return on that $200 million to do the basics curtain, wall project. And then the balance of the $350 million is for lobbies, elevators, new bathrooms new corridors etcetera and the new amenity space.","So you've been yelling at me for quarter after quarter after quarter for not having costs in the -- not having made our cost projections and our budgets public. And the reason for that is, is that, it's a big project. We've been working on it. We're trying to get them accurate and this is our best guess as to what those numbers are, okay?","By the way a significant portion of this job is already in construction drawings and already bought, okay? And when you drive by it you'll see that the first mockup of what this enormous bustle which projects 45 feet off the plaza and 75 feet off the ground which includes the better part of a couple of hundred thousand square feet of new space is already mocked up, so we can get -- you can get a feel for it. So this is our budget. We're happy with our budget.","John Guinee","Great, all right. Thank you and good luck. Great job.","Steven Roth","Thanks John. One last thing. To be totally clear, the budget includes TIs and leasing commissions for the new bustle created space, okay? It does not include, TI and leasing commissions in the normal course where we rent in all of the other space in the building which we think is an appropriate way to do the cost of accounting.","John Guinee","Great, okay. Thank you.","Steven Roth","Thanks. I love what you wrote on June 12, John. Thanks.","Operator","And the next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Just wanted to go back to Farley. We have heard that there's good interest in the building's high floors. And even if I look at your website right now the fifth floor is not showing as being available. And earlier this month, the fourth floor wasn't showing as being available though it is now. I mean is it fair to say that these two floors are spoken for?","Steven Roth","We have nothing more to say about Farley other than what we've already said, okay? We have activity. It does us no good to speculate on what these important negotiations are that are ongoing now. It does us no good to speculate on that in this venue.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And then going back to 110, I think you gave the annual rent on the ground lease being $2.5 million. Can you give us the formula about how that works? Is it a percentage of the value of the land on a fair market value reset? I mean for some other companies you've seen it or buildings it could be 4% to 5% of land value. What's the formula calculation here?","Steven Roth","I think we've disclosed -- what we are prepared to disclose at the present time. The current rent is $2.5 million. It's a normal fair market value reset. It happens in 2023.","Nick Yulico","Yes, I guess I mean the reason I asked is if you actually do assume it's 4.5% of land value then it looks like the land value is about, it's less than $50 a foot which seems pretty low and would require -- you could be facing as you've mentioned your supplemental and material reset on the ground lease. So I think it would be pretty helpful for us to understand how that could work so we could think about the ultimate yield on the project.","Steven Roth","Well, the answer is it will be material and -- but we are not prepared to speculate. This is a reset which is subject to arbitration four years from now. It's impossible to predict what the land values will be four years from now. I have already said in my comments 10, 15 minutes ago, we strongly believe that the land value is coming in and coming our way. And I really don't want to say anything more about it.","Nick Yulico","Thanks.","Steven Roth","But I will say one last thing. In the last comments, I've made about that I said that the income of this building is going to go up to the sunny side of $150 million a year. Whatever the land resets to will be a material number, but it will not be significant in the scheme of the huge income coming in from this great building.","Operator","Okay. The next question in the queue comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning, everybody. So two questions. First, Steve yes sort of, a two-part on PENN. You talked about the $100 million of just say sort of, catchall development. So sort of, curious one, I don't know who the landowner is I don't know if it's the MTA. But I'm assuming that that $100 million captures whatever public mandated improvements whether it's subway or train or whatever. I'm assuming that that $100 million includes that in that budget. And then two, I still -- maybe I missed it earlier, but I don't think that you guys have quantified the NOI that's going to come off-line when you start work on PENN1 and PENN2 just as we think about our 2020 earnings?","Steven Roth","You know, the first is that the $100 million of neighborhood improvements really is improvements. It does include improving the street that we have closed in between the two buildings. But the rest of them basically is capital that we are spending on behalf of our building, okay? There is another project that's in the works, which will enhance our situation in the underground in PENN Station, which is not yet ready for a disclosure and that'll probably come out next quarter and the quarter after. It's not a big deal, but it's -- it's incrementally better and better and better.","With respect to what comes off-line, what comes online et cetera and the timing of it quarter-by-quarter we do not give guidance. And we have not basically said other than some brief remarks that Joe made about what is going to happen in terms of the details of that. I did make what I consider to be an important comment half an hour ago that says I know that you have the model, I know it's important.","But the big picture here is that over a short period of development time we're going to transform up a neighborhood. We are going to add all the surrounding land that we have assets that we own and we are going to take a $60 building and take it into the 90s. That's the big picture, okay? We have not given guidance about quarter-by-quarter results, okay? Quarter-by-quarter in service -- out of service, et cetera.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is on the Topshop on Fifth Avenue. You guys wrote-off the value of your improvements for that ground lease position just based on sort of the market-value being equivalent to what the ground rent is, which I believe you guys said is $5.5 million. So just, sort of, curious just given that that rent seems really low especially given what your neighbors signed with Puma across the street. Just sort of curious more about how you made the determination that the ground rent effectively represents market value. I don't know maybe it's counting all the fit out that you have to do or maybe it's the length of time left on that ground lease that drives it just more than the actual -- what the actual street retail rents would be there.","Steven Roth","Alex, it's all of the above. First of all, we have not said that we are abandoning the ground lease. That may cause -- it's an option that we have in the future. That's that one. The accounting is that there is a liability and an asset for this right to use is that the terminology...","Joe Macnow","Right of use.","Steven Roth","Right of use. And so we wrote-off the asset right of use. We retained the liability. If as and when we cancel the non-recourse lease that will be -- that liability will be taken as the income and extinguished. So that's the accounting.","In terms of the business side of it, the way we do the math if you take the ground rent payments and the expenses of operating the building and you take the expensive income that comes from the small office portion and what we might get from the market vis-\u00e0-vis a retail, the building is pushed to slightly underwater.","If you then take the fact that there's a 14-year ground lease and you will have to amortize the tenant improvements it becomes underwater more. And if you take the fact that the ground lease goes up by its terms I know that $2 million to $3 million a year shortly then the build from the -- on the whole when you get done with the math there's even negative economics or no economics. And the likelihood is this is not something that we want to spend our energy and time on.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Now you -- with the 14 years left you answered the question. Thank you, Steve.","Steven Roth","Thanks, Alex. See you.","Operator","Your next question in the queue comes from Daniel Ismail with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Daniel Ismail","Thanks and good morning. Just two quick ones on PENN Plaza. I appreciate all the new disclosure. But can you give an update on the refresher on the air rights that you own in PENN Plaza and these ability and perhaps the ability to monetize those air rights in the future?","Steven Roth","There's plenty of air rights. We own lots of them. There is air rights that are on top of Madison Square Garden that we own a share of. There's air rights on top of the landmark Farley Building that we have -- are we contracted to move those? That we have access to. We don't have legal access but we have access to. So there's plenty of air rights, okay? And then now ready for, and so we have multiple sites that we have -- that are in the future the both interesting one of which is obviously the Hotel Pennsylvania which has a current ULURP approval for a 2.8 million square foot?","Joe Macnow","2.8 rent.","Steven Roth","What?","Joe Macnow","2.8 rentable.","Steven Roth","Okay. That\u2019s it. For 2.8 million square feet, which would be a tear down and a rebuild et cetera. And then we have multiple other sites in the neighborhood. So there is not a shortage of air rights. We own plenty of them. And there are plenty of them available to be repurchased and moved from different government sources and private owners.","Daniel Ismail","And can you remind us like how many air rights you directly own currently?","Steven Roth","I don't think so. I don't have that in my head. So we will have to get back to you. But I don't think it's a material calculation.","Daniel Ismail","Okay. And just one on the redevelopment of Penn Plaza. With the new green New York building standards, did that cause any material uplift in total costs? And will the new redevelopments be in compliance with the new standards?","Steven Roth","Barry?","Barry Langer","There's not a material increase in cost today. And yes, the new developments will be in compliance with those standards.","Steven Roth","So the answer is there is not compliance. There is a goal of -- let's say emission standard and if you do not meet the goal there are penalties. So actually there's not a binary comply or don't comply. What there is, is that the assets will be measured for their emission. And based upon that result, there will be a penalty tax if you will. The interesting thing about it and we said this I think on the last call and that is that we believe that we are already in substantial compliance with the 2024 requirements, so ones that come at the end of the decade are more strenuous. We -- but if we maintain our current position, the tax would be deminimis for noncompliance.","Now, there's two things that are going on with respect to the regulation. And by the way this is in New York, but it's going to go universal across the whole country and probably the world as well. But first is that 80% or 85% of the energy usage from our buildings is under the control of our tenants, not under the control of the landlord. So therefore -- and we've been talking to the government authorities about this, but more needs to be modified, so that it gives incentives to the tenants to comply. And that will happen over time.","The second is even more important. To the extent that alternative sources of energy are going to go into the creation of electricity, a transmission of it from where it's created down into New York City and other major cities that will cause the carbon footprint to decrease substantially, okay? So there's all of that kind of stuff that's going on.","Daniel Ismail","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","The next question in the queue comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Mike Bilerman","Mike Bilerman up with Manny. Michael or Joe, just to think about the sources and uses from a just timing perspective. You think about you had $1 billion today, another $1 billion coming in from 220, the $100 million that closed post quarter from 330 Madison and then the eventual $1.8 billion redemption of the preferred a couple of years out. You've outlined $1.7 billion which is quite helpful to have the costs and the returns. That incremental $1.7 billion that needs to go out the door, plus another $360 million for the dividend towards the end of the year, how should we think about the timing of that $2 billion going out and then the drawdown of cash and the influx of cash just as we think about the ins and outs going on?","Joe Macnow","Michael, it's Joe. That's a pretty complicated question to do by phone. But at least, I want to clarify one thing. You said $1 billion on -- coming in from 220. That's $2 billion not $1 billion, $2 billion.","Mike Bilerman","Well of net -- net of the debt that you're going to repay. $1 billion of net cash.","Joe Macnow","No. there's no -- that whole $950 million is zero today. And from that point forward, we get $2 billion, $1 billion of profit, $1 billion of our cost that we put into the project recouped in the sales process. The right number for you to take off is $2 billion. Now, our NAV shows it properly, but the incremental cash coming to the company is $2 billion against $1.7 billion that you've accurately portrayed needs in the three projects in the Penn Plaza and Penn District area in the catalog. Of course, the capital needs if we were to do the Hotel Penn would be much, much larger or any of the other add-ons that we hadn't talked about like the question on the air rights felt would.","Michael Franco","I don't know if you were -- I mean we can come back to you with a little more specificity on timing of the outflows. Obviously Farley is well underway. PENN2 will be generally let's call it '20 through '22 and PENN1 over a couple of year period beginning next year. But I think that the most -- what I think you're trying to get and I think the most important point is the cash will be in the door before that money has to be spent, right? So 220, I think we said on today, Joe correct me if I'm wrong, $1.1 billion of liquidity as of quarter end right? That number will go well north of $2 billion by year end Michael. And so when you look at the...","Joe Macnow","After the dividend.","Michael Franco","Post the special dividend. That's exactly right. So net of the special dividend, it will still be well north of $2 billion, right? So that gives you a sense of the amount of money that's going to flow out of 220 the balance of this year. And so as we look at the ins and outs, right, all the money will be in the door in advance of needing to spend the $1.7 billion that's laid out in the supplement. All right. And that's what I'll need to tuck in the retail preferred ever et cetera the money will be in the door.","Mike Bilerman","Right, which gives you even more liquidity as you start thinking about the $1.8 billion preferred, but then also the refinancings that occur in 2020, and I don't know if you want to talk about 11 Penn and maybe 888 Seventh whether as you think about upsizing those mortgages or you're thinking about using cash to repay and distribute leverage further. How should we start thinking about incremental cash that could -- that potentially could come from that or use of cash?","Steven Roth","Michael, I don't -- the answer is, first of all, with respect to 220, the sellout, published sellout is three -- maybe $3.25 billion, okay? We've sold $1 billion so far. That means there is $2-odd billion coming out of that with no debt requirements that all comes into our treasury, okay? That's step 1.","Step two is, our internal budget shows that our -- that we are able to spend as it comes due over the next number of years, the $1.7 billion incremental that's going into PENN1, PENN2 and Farley. And at the same time our cash balances will fund it out of -- off our balance sheet with no new debt and our cash balances will grow, okay?","With respect to our balance sheet, we have been showing pro formas to you all. That shows that our debt ratios are -- actually if you pro forma for what's happening with certainty, our debt ratios are low and going lower, and we're very comfortable with that. We have an enormous opportunity on our balance sheet and we have an enormous queue of un-financed assets, and even underfinanced assets that we can increase our liquidity for.","So for example, I mean the right strategy, we are principally a secured vendor, okay? We do that for lots of reasons that I have written about, which have to do with non-recourse debt and safety and whatever. And we have -- we're actually encasing an internal conversation about this now.","We have -- we rather than encumber a new asset, which is currently unencumbered and we have $10 billion or $15 billion of those, we would rather increase the debt on an underlevered asset, which is encumbered.","So all of that what we consider, but right now we have --we are in a spectacular financial condition, and we're very happy with where we stand. And we are delighted to be able to deliver PENN1, PENN2 and Farley off our balance sheet with no debt.","Mike Bilerman","Yeah. Last question. Michael, in your prepared remarks, I think you made the comment, it's better to be a seller than a buyer. Is there anything else that's less than the disposition program today? Any other cleanup? And anything else that you're contemplating from that perspective?","Michael Franco","The answer is yes, Michael. We've got -- there's still a few cleanup items from the original $1 billion, Steve referenced, I don't know 18 months ago or what not, small one of which we just put under contract. But $70 million, we've got two, three others in the works as well. So, we're finishing that original $1 billion of non-core assets. Team is hard at work on those.","Steven Roth","It's interesting. First of all, the community has been suggesting that we sell our non-New York City assets out there in, what I'd call, the suburbs of New York, mainly The Martin Chicago; the 555 California Street in San Francisco for years now. But the fact of the matter is that those two are two of our best assets with the highest growth trajectory.","And when we have sold 555 California three, four years ago when there was a big drumbeat to do it, we would have undervalued the asset by $500 million, $700 million at least. I think Michael said in his remarks that that asset is underrated by pick a number 25%, and so whatever. So we -- those two assets are not on the for-sale list today.","The other thing is that I think one of the analysts wrote with some assets, you dilute earnings. You -- and so if you take our retail sale, we sold it at NAV. We sold it at a number which we thought and the market I think thought was a very strong execution.","But nonetheless, you are selling the income to the buyer and you are losing that income, so it's dilutive income. So there is a tension between selling assets when you dilute your income and your analyst want to take your stock down for that. So it's a complicated thing.","Mike Bilerman","I appreciate the color.","Steven Roth","Let me add a little take onto that Michael, and that is that it's good to have cash, but cash doesn't appreciate, okay? Assets appreciate. So if you have well-chosen assets that have a great future, they can appreciate. So -- I mean that's just sort of a little bit about that. But you can be sure we look at every assets and every -- at every asset and every piece of debt in the company at least once a month.","Mike Bilerman","Yeah. It was helpful to get your thoughts regarding using cash on the buyback versus investing it in new as well as redeveloped assets and harvesting net value. It definitely sounds as though there's additional cash coming in, and we'll continue to look for ways that the balance sheet and that cash can be used to drive value for existing and new shareholders.","Steven Roth","Yeah, and we too. Look, we're investing the money and creating $9 of value versus $1.5 from $1 billion is a no-brainer, right? The point that you're making is that that's not our only cash. We've got more assets. We've got more financial flexibility. We couldn't be more well aware of that. Thank you for pointing it out.","Mike Bilerman","All right, guys. Have a great rest of the summer.","Steven Roth","Thank you, too.","Operator","And gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time.","Michael Franco","Great. Thank you everybody for listening, participating on our call today. We look forward to your participation on our third quarter earnings call, which will be on Tuesday, October 29. Enjoy the rest of the summer as well. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Vanessa, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Cathy Creswell. You may begin.","Catherine Creswell","Thank you, Vanessa. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our fourth quarter earnings release and filed our annual report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents, as well as our supplemental financial information package, are available on our website, www.vno.com, under the Investor Relations section.","In these documents and during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Also in the room are Wendy Silverstein and Michael Franco, Executive Vice Presidents, Co-Heads of Acquisitions and Capital Markets.","I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's fourth quarter call. I'd like to begin by again affirming our commitment to our strategy of simplifying, pruning and focusing the business. We have made significant progress in that regard and there is more that we will do. Here are some of the specifics.","We have sold down the Mart business, retaining only the 3.6 million square-foot Chicago Mart building. We will continue to create value here by converting underperforming showroom and trade show space to conventional office tech space anchored by Motorola Mobility\/Google's 600,000 square feet. We have made great progress exiting the mall business. Green Acres and Kings Plaza were sold in prior periods for an -- for aggregate proceeds of $1.25 billion. We closed the sale of Broadway Mall yesterday for proceeds of $94 million. We have trimmed nonstrategic strip shopping centers, single tenant retail assets and other non-keepers by selling 28 properties for $415 million. We have exited JCPenney. We have exited LNR. We have strategically combined all of our Manhattan assets, including our office and street retail and Hotel Pennsylvania and Alexander's properties, into one focused best-in-class operating segment. We have completed in the fourth quarter the sale of 866 U.N. Plaza for $200 million, Harlem Park land for $66 million and exited the Cleveland Medical Mart. We have in total so far sold 44 assets for $3.6 billion, we have about $1.1 billion in the market for sale, much of which is now under negotiation, and we have more on deck.","As I said before, in this market, we will buy carefully and, again this year, likely sell more than we buy. We will continue to build cash reserves for opportunities that will undoubtedly present themselves in the future. We have used $1 billion of sales proceeds in like-kind exchanges to partially fund $2.3 billion of acquisitions, all of which were in Manhattan, building our core office, retail and residential assets and enhancing the quality of our portfolio.","Now to leasing. Company-wide, in the quarter, we leased 1.27 million (sic) square feet in 140 transactions with positive mark-to-markets of 11.2% cash and 12.5% GAAP. For the year, we leased 6.45 million square feet in 576 transactions, with positive mark-to-markets of 6.1% cash and 11.8% GAAP. Leasing performance of our best-in-class 2.4 million square-foot Manhattan Street retail portfolio deserves special mention. Here, we achieved full year mark-to-markets of 123.7% cash and 92.6% GAAP. That means that rents for these new retail leases were more than double the old rents. We are focusing hard on our large development pipeline including the redevelopment of 1.1 million square feet in 2 buildings on 34th Street, both of which will be repositioned for creative technology tenants; the New York Marriott Marquis retail and signage project at the bull's eye of the Bow Tie in Times Square, which is now under construction; the 1.4 million square-foot Springfield Mall renovation, which is under construction for a holiday 2014 opening; the transformation of 280 Park Avenue at 48th Street; the 699-unit residential project in Pentagon City with Whole Foods is now under construction; 220 Central Park South where we are developing a tall residential tower; and, of course, the Penn Plaza District.","The Manhattan office market continues to improve. The islands of Manhattan is now tilting slightly to the south and slightly to the west, greatly inuring to the benefit of the Penn Plaza district where we are the dominant owner with over 7 million square feet of office and retail space and the Hotel Pennsylvania. Creating more value from our Penn Plaza holdings will be a major focus of our company over the coming years.","Turning to operations. We had a very strong fourth quarter, and I'm very pleased with our financial results. Our fourth quarter comparable FFO was $1.33 per share, 19.8% higher than last year's fourth quarter. Our full year comparable FFO was 19.9% better.","Our New York business continues to put up very strong industry-leading metrics. Everybody knows my roots are in retail, and I'm particularly pleased with our recently signed 44,000 square-foot, 4-level Topshop flagship at 608 Fifth Avenue, across the street from Saks Fifth Avenue. This highly important high-volume, high-fashion emporium will open on Halloween.","Our Washington business is now bumping along the bottom. As CFO Steve Theriot will tell you, we are estimating that Washington's comparable EBITDA for 2014 will be $10 million to $15 million lower than 2013. As Steve will also tell you, we are estimating that FFO will be slightly higher in 2014, the result of interest reduction we renegotiated -- we negotiated on the Skyline loan.","As I've said before, I believe the vacant square footage in Washington is not valued at all in our stock and therefore, represents tremendous upside that we will realize as we lease this space up.","A word about capital markets. Capital markets continue to be robust with debt plentiful at historic low interest rates and equity investors aggressively bidding for high-quality assets.","To sum up, I'm very pleased with both our operating performance and our progress on simplification and focusing the business.","Now I will turn it over to Steve Theriot who will cover financials.","Stephen W. Theriot","Thank you, Steve. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter comparable FFO of $1.33 per share, up from $1.11 in the prior year's fourth quarter, a 19.8% increase. Full year 2013 comparable FFO was $5.01 per share, up from $4.18 in the prior year, a 19.9% increase. Fourth quarter comparable EBITDA was $424.9 million, ahead of last year's fourth quarter by $38.4 million or 9.9%. Full year 2013 comparable EBITDA was $1 billion -- $1.66 billion, ahead of last year by 149 -- $159 million, or 10.6%.","Our New York business produced $246.1 million of comparable EBITDA for the fourth quarter and $942.8 million for the year. These amounts are ahead of last year's fourth quarter by $30.3 million, or 14.1%, and ahead of the full year 2012 by $132.6 million, or 16.4%, primarily driven by strong same-store increases of 6.7% for the quarter and 5.5% for the year and property acquisitions.","Our Washington business produced $83.3 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, ahead of last year's fourth quarter by $2.6 million. For the full year, our Washington business produced $341.2 million of comparable EBITDA, behind last year by $14.3 million, primarily due to the effects of BRAC move-outs and the sluggish leasing environment in Washington. These results were in line with our revised guidance of down $10 million to $15 million. We expect that Washington's 2014 comparable EBITDA will be approximately $10 million to $15 million behind 2013.","To give a little color on the expected Washington results during 2014, while we are expecting a slight increase in occupancy in Washington during 2014, the lag between the signing of leases that we expect and the contribution of these leases to our earnings will push the full effect of the expected benefit to 2015. In addition, more than offsetting the reduction in comparable EBITDA during 2014, we will realize an incremental interest expense reduction of $16 million from the restructuring of the Skyline mortgage loan. Net-net, we expect the Washington segment will contribute slightly higher FFO in 2014 as compared to 2013.","Our strips and malls business produced $58.1 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter and $223 million for the year. These amounts were ahead of last year's fourth quarter and full year by $0.5 million and $6.5 million, respectively.","Total fourth quarter FFO was negative $0.04 per share, down from positive $0.30 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter. Noncomparable items in this year's fourth quarter were a loss of $270.9 million, or $1.37 per share, as compared to a loss of $161 million, or $0.81 per share, in the fourth quarter last year.","This year's fourth quarter noncomparable items included $282 million of negative FFO from our investment in Toys\"R\"Us, reducing the carrying amount to our $80 million estimate of fair value. This year's fourth quarter noncomparable items also included $18.1 million of transaction costs, primarily related to our acquisition of 655 Fifth Avenue, offset by a $24 million in net gains from the sale of land parcels, primarily Harlem Park. Please see our press release or overview of MD&A on Page 39 of our Form 10-K for a complete summary of noncomparable items.","And with that, I'll turn it over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business.","David R. Greenbaum","Steve, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Before I turn to our results for the quarter, I want to spend a couple of minutes recapping the overall market's performance in 2013 and what we're expecting for 2014. I'm sure many of you on this call read the various market reports produced by the brokerage community. Let me pick out some of the highlights.","The most recent headline was \"market stays warm amidst the January chill.\" A year-end market report described 2013 as the year with a \"surge\" in leasing, where tech and media continued to be the primary driver of the market. Other reports highlighted the improving sentiment and the continuing momentum in the market. These headlines sum up our view of where we are in the marketplace. The New York City economy added 93,000 private-sector jobs in 2013. Since the recession, the city has gained 330,000 private-sector jobs, which puts total employment at 200,000 more jobs than prior to the financial downturn. Office-using jobs are up 102,000 since the recession, having fully recovered, but the rate of growth slowed in 2013 with 8,700 office jobs added. The tech sector in general was the strongest, accounting for nearly half of all net new jobs in 2013. Anecdotally, we hear that Google alone is planning on adding 1,000 new jobs in New York in 2014.","I read an interesting article the other day that I thought captured the technology sector perfectly. Tech, effectively, has stopped being an industry and has turned into a way of life for all of us, permeating all aspects of urban culture. Within our portfolio, technology, advertising, media and information companies, TAMI, accounted for some 25% of our 2.4 million square feet of leasing activity in 2013 with names such as Facebook, Rocket Fuel, Symantec, IPG, Sapient, Mitel, Ericsson, Netsmart and Presidio Networking. Some of the pundits talk about weakness in financial services. Let me state emphatically, there is life in the financial services sector. Looking at our own portfolio, midsized financial services firms made up another 25% of our 2013 leasing activity, some 600,000 square feet in 36 transactions, of which some 300,000 square feet, fully half of the activity, represented real growth in the marketplace.","The Manhattan office market ended 2013 with positive absorption in the 4 million to 6 million square-foot range, depending upon the brokerage report, and the highest volume of leasing activity since the financial crisis, over 37 million square feet. The top end of the market was also strong with 60 deals over $100 per square foot. Seven of those deals were ours.","Looking at 2014, economic and employment forecasts for the New York region remain modestly positive. Consensus in the brokerage community is that the positive momentum will continue with job growth driving New York's office-using, media, advertising, fashion retail and technology companies.","Let me now turn to Vornado's performance. Office leasing in the fourth quarter totaled 559,000 square feet in 47 transactions, taking our total leasing for the year to 2.4 million square feet in 159 transactions. Activity was well-balanced throughout the portfolio, not concentrated in any one submarket. Consistent with the market-wide positive absorption over the past 12 months, 26% of our activity represented tenants new to, or expanding in, New York. Real growth, real expansion. Year-end occupancy was 96.6%, up 70 basis points from the third quarter. Basically, we are full. Our average starting rent this quarter was a healthy $59.45, with very strong positive mark-to-markets of 13.3% GAAP and 10.2% cash. For the year, our mark-to-markets were 14% GAAP and 5.6% cash.","Our fourth quarter leasing activity was highlighted by a 130,000 square-foot lease we executed with Hachette at 1290 Avenue of the Americas. This deal, along with the State Street Bank lease that we previously announced, completed our re-leasing of the 181,000 square feet of Microsoft space. We leased the space in advance of Microsoft's move-out, which took place just this past weekend, and really speaks volumes to the success of the building transformation program we have completed here.","Since our acquisition of 1290 in 2007, we have leased 1.4 million square feet in this 2.1 million square-foot building, taking rents from an average of $52 per square foot at acquisition to $72 today. At 330 Madison, another one of our recent successful transformations, we leased 74,000 square feet to HSBC, joining other marquee tenants in the building including Guggenheim Partners and Jones Lang LaSalle. At 280 Park Avenue, our joint venture with SL Green, the full block lobby is now opened, revealing the quality of our transformation program. We have very good leasing momentum here where we recently completed 2 new leases. Mount Kellet Capital Management took 30,000 square feet on the fourth floor in the fourth quarter and already this quarter, we have signed Napier Park Global Capital, a spin-off from Citigroup, for 25,000 square feet on the third floor.","At 650 Madison Avenue, the 600,000 square-foot trophy and retail asset we acquired in the fall, we kicked off our leasing with a triple-digit deal with Lakewood Capital Management. In Midtown South at 770 Broadway, we expect to sign in days a long-term lease expansion with J.Crew for 80,000 square feet, which takes J.Crew's total space to 380,000 feet. Along with Facebook, which moved into its new Manhattan headquarter space yesterday, Monday, and AOL, this building is a cutting edge creative hub in Midtown South.","In Penn Plaza, our occupancy is 97.3%. Most importantly, over the last 15 years, our Penn Plaza portfolio consistently has been fully leased, averaging 96.5% occupancy. In the fourth quarter, a diverse group of tenants continue to expand with our Penn Plaza portfolio. Rocket Fuel, a technology tenant I mentioned on the second quarter call, expanded by 40,000 square feet at 100 West 33rd Street, now occupying 90,000 feet. Rainbow Media expanded by 21,000 feet at 11 Penn, and Valley National Bank expanded at One Penn. Construction is also well underway for our building redevelopments at 7 West 34th Street and 330 West 34th Street, whereas Steve mentioned we will be delivering over 1.1 million square feet of space. These buildings are being repositioned to attract technology, fashion and media tenants in the Midtown South market. Taking lessons we learned from the buildouts by Facebook at 770 Broadway and Motorola at the Mart, we are creating communal spaces for all of the tenants to use.","Just yesterday, we kicked off our leasing at 330 West 34th Street, signing our first lease for 180,000 square feet.","Let me now turn to our Manhattan street retail where in the fourth quarter we completed a deal for 44,000 square-foot, 4-level flagship lease with Topshop Topman at 608 Fifth Avenue. As you may recall, in the fall of 2012, we purchased a note leading to the acquisition of the leasehold interest in this landmark property on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 49th Street at Rockefeller Center and across the street from Saks Fifth Avenue. We then made a deal to buy out the existing retail tenant and relocated all of the office tenants on the second and third floors to allow us to create Topshop's Fifth Avenue flagship store. Of course, we also own the Topshop flagship in SoHo. For the quarter, we completed 6 retail leases totaling 63,000 square feet with very strong mark-to-markets, 109.7% cash and 43.3% GAAP, capping a year where we leased 138,000 square feet at mark-to-markets of 123.7% cash and 92.6% GAAP.","In Times Square, our 1540 Broadway property and 1535 Broadway, the Marriott site, bookends of the Times Square Bow Tie, were prominently featured during Super Bowl week as the backdrop in much of the national TV coverage. I'm sure that all of you saw our construction barricade in the front of the Marriott. Concentrated in the best submarkets, Times Square, Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue, SoHo and Penn Plaza, the street retail business is a jewel in our New York portfolio. While the retail portfolio accounts for 10% of our total Manhattan square footage, it generates some 26% of the New York division EBITDA.","The Hotel Pennsylvania continued to capitalize on New York's record tourism, over 54 million visitors to New York in 2013. Occupancy for the year averaged 93.4%, quite a feat for the 1,700-room hotel, with RevPAR up 8.4% to $148, the highest levels we have ever achieved.","Let me now turn to the 3.5 million square-foot Chicago Merchandise Mart building located at the center of the hot River North market. There's been a lot of attention resulting from Google's announced sale of Motorola to Lenovo. Motorola started moving its 2,300 employees into the space 2 weeks ago, with all groups expected to be in the building by the third week in March. The space is really cool. If any of you are going to be in Chicago, let us know and we'd be happy to arrange a tour for you. And since I'm sure someone on this call is going to ask, Google remains the full guarantor under the lease for its entire term. There are significant moneymaking opportunities at the Mart to create value by continuing the conversion of several hundred thousand square feet of underperforming showroom and trade show space to office space for both traditional users and creative tech tenants.","The Governor of Illinois recently announced a state investment in a medical technology incubator called Matter that will be taking 25,000 square feet of space in the building. Modeled after 1871, the incubator for digital startups that is also in the building, Matter will offer office space for biotech and pharmaceutical startups combined with events for entrepreneurs and industry professionals. With all of this activity, the Mart is quickly becoming the home to Chicago's most creative and technologically innovative companies.","I haven't said much on past calls regarding our 1.8 million square-foot 555 California, the best office building in San Francisco. In 2013, we had a very, very active year. We signed 418,000 square feet of leases in 14 transactions, with average starting rents of $63 a foot and a cash mark-to-market of 22%. The highlight of our leasing activity was a 261,000 square-foot renewal with BofA, Bank of America. BofA is actually expanding its occupancy in the building while we'll be giving back in 2015 the space it previously subleased. We currently are in negotiation with many of these BofA subtenants.","We also saw a renewal expansion lease with Morgan Stanley, which now leases 130,000 square feet in the building, and a renewal with UBS, which leases 93,000 feet. Our tenant roster also includes Goldman Sachs, KKR, Dodge & Cox and MacKenzie. Importantly, the tech guys have now also come our way. We leased the 52nd floor, the top of the building with what is arguably the most spectacular view space in San Francisco, to Supercell, a mobile gaming company, for just shy of a triple-digit rent. Our pipeline also includes a 50,000 square-foot lease in final lease negotiation with a tech giant.","To conclude my remarks, let me summarize the entire New York division. We had a very strong quarter. Our key performance metrics are industry-leading, with same-store EBITDA increases to the overall division of 6.7% GAAP and 4.4% cash. Isolating just the New York office business, our same-store EBITDA increased 6.9% GAAP and 5.8% cash.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Mitchell to cover Washington.","Mitchell N. Schear","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. All in all, in the Washington market, 2013 as we expected it to be. The already-weakened real estate market was further stymied as the federal government struggled to put its house in order. We survived sequestration, a 16-day government shutdown and a debt ceiling deal finalized in the 23rd hour. Now with the newly approved 2-year federal budget deal and with the debt ceiling raised, we are hopeful for a smoother road ahead. Despite the tumult of 2013, the Washington economy remained resilient. We grew by 25,800 jobs last year, and the unemployment rate remains the lowest in the nation at 4.6%. Towards the end of 2013, we began to see a thawing of the office market and activity has picked up. We are optimistic that it will carry on throughout 2014. For 2013, the brokerage reports show positive net absorption at 1.8 million square feet. While this is lower than the 10-year average of 4.4 million, it is substantially better than the negative 2 point million -- 2.6 million square feet in 2012. All in all, we'll take it.","Now turning to the performance of our Washington division. In 2013, we leased over 2 million square feet office and retail space in 232 deals at average office rents of $39.91, marginally down from the $40.55 in 2012. Government activity accounted for 26% and private sector leases accounted for the remaining 74%. Renewals accounted for 60% and new tenants accounted for 40%.","Our 2013 leasing performance included some of the largest transactions in the market, the 183,000 square-foot Fish and Wildlife lease at Skyline, the 384,000 square-foot Sidley renewal at 1501 K Street where we own 5%, and 247,000 square feet renewal of Family Health International at 1825 Connecticut Avenue.","In addition to our big deals in 2013, we also completed several brand-builder deals. These are leases that do more than add to our occupancy metrics. They are brands that elevate and reposition our buildings and our neighborhoods. They include our deals with Facebook, Goober, TechShop and Whole Foods. We own 2,400 apartments clustered in Crystal City, Pentagon City, Rosslyn and Georgetown. This business continues to deliver strong results with 96.3% occupancy.","Now for our quarterly results. In the fourth quarter, we completed 380,000 square feet of office and retail leases. Overall, office leases signed in the fourth quarter generated a GAAP mark-to-market of 3.4% and a cash mark-to-market of negative 2.5%, a very satisfactory performance in this market. So our total occupancy, including residential at 83.4%, was down 20 basis points from Q3. Office occupancy was even with Q3 at 80.7%. I'd like to reiterate what Steve said earlier. Our vacancy is a huge opportunity for us. As we lease the space, it will unlock tremendous value for us. Quarter-over-quarter, we reported positive same-store EBITDA growth equal to 4.1% GAAP and 2.8% cash. We are predicting another active year of leasing and an uptick in occupancy during the second half of 2014.","Our job is to see every deal, execute aggressively and think strategically. With the highest concentration of engineers and advanced degrees in the country in a Metro area that's among the top 5 for venture capital, D.C. is a top market for tech growth. But to us, technology is more than a sector, it's a growing demographic of smart, mobile, young workers. This is an important target audience that we are focusing on.","In Crystal City, where we own a city of over 7 million square feet, we are making several transformative moves to attempt -- several transformative moves to attract young creatives to shape a dynamic community. Our first move involves a partnership with WeWork in Crystal City and in Dupont Circle. In 2013, CNN Money named WeWork's founders as the next Mark Zuckerburg. WeWork provides work for startup small companies to collocate in furnished fully wired environments that inspire collaboration and community. WeWork spaces are becoming change agents for their neighborhoods, infusing fresh energy and attracting talented people and growing companies. We believe they are the leaders in creative collocating space. In D.C., we just signed a 44,000 square-foot lease with WeWork that could expand to 160,000 square feet at our 1875 Connecticut Avenue building in Dupont Circle. The space will open later this year. And in Crystal City, we will venture with WeWork to re-purpose an existing 164,000 square-foot office building at 2221 South Clark Street into approximately 300 rental residential units. These apartments are designed for today's mobile and collaborative workers. They will combine small, furnished units, a full technology package and dynamic social spaces like shared dining and lounge areas. We believe that WeWork will add an important new layer to our Crystal City neighborhood, and their residents will be a magnet for others like them. Currently in final design, the units will be opened in the middle of 2015. In addition, we expect a new WeWork office location will also be open in Crystal City by 2016.","Our second strategic transaction is Crystal Tech. Crystal Tech will combine 27,000 square feet of Crystal City office space with a $50 million technology fund. The fund will be managed by Paul Singh, a former partner of 500 Startups and a global leader in tech investment and growth. The fund, seeded by Vornado, will invest in promising early-stage technology companies. These companies will co-locate in Crystal City in a high-energy environment now under construction. Crystal Tech will also feature workshops and events produced by Tech Cocktail, a widely followed media company focused on the tech community. Crystal Tech opens its doors at 2231 Crystal Drive in April, and we invite all of you to come check it out.","Next, in late March, TechShop will open their new 22,000 square-foot Washington area location in Crystal City. TechShop is a leader in maker studios. The birthplace for many startups and inventions, TechShop is a world-class prototyping studio that provides tools, equipment technology and classes for inventors, engineers and entrepreneurs. We see TechShop as a great new amenity and another key piece of our innovation fabric.","And further, next month, we will debut our design lab. Design lab will transform a single floor at 251 18th Street into 6 prebuilt office suites, each designed by a different architect specifically for creative companies. These suites will be furnished and ready to lease. We see design lab as a showcase for innovative new ideas for office space complementing all of our other initiatives to attract the specialized user group. Together, these strategic initiatives will lay the foundation for a new kind of Crystal City. As we're doing at the Mart in Chicago and in Penn Plaza in New York, we are transforming not only our real estate product but entire neighborhoods by attracting creative companies and people.","In Pentagon City, we have now begun construction on our 699-unit residential tower and Whole Foods Market to be delivered in 2016. In total, we have more than 7 million square feet of developable inventory for both office and residential in Rosslyn, Crystal City, Pentagon City and the district on land that we already own. This is, again, huge value-creation potential for our Washington business.","I thank you very much, and I will now turn the call over to Joe Macnow.","Joseph Macnow","Thanks, Mitchell. Let me first touch on our strip shopping centers and malls, both of which had a strong quarter. Strip shopping centers occupancy was 94.3% at quarter end, equal to the third quarter, and up 30 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Occupancy at the remaining malls was 94.3%, also up 30 basis points from the third quarter and up 160 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. We leased 200,000 square feet at the strip shopping centers with a positive mark-to-market of 17.4% GAAP and 10.7% cash. We leased 137,000 square feet at the malls, with a positive mark-to-market of 9% GAAP and 1.7% cash.","Now turning to capital markets. Earlier this month, we completed a $600 million financing of our 220 Central Park South site. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% floating, matures in January 2016, with 3 one-year extensions. In November, we refinanced the mortgage on 11 Penn Plaza. The new $450 million loan bears interest at 3.95% fixed to 7 years, and replaces a $343 million loan, which bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.35% floating. During the quarter, we also repaid the $87.9 million loan on the Universal buildings in Washington and the $52.8 million loan on the Las Catalinas Mall in Puerto Rico, un-encumbering both of these assets.","As of today, we have $3.8 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.5 billion of cash and liquid securities and $2.3 billion of undrawn revolving credit facilities. Overall, $1.3 billion better than at the start of the year. Our objective has been to build liquidity as we continue to sell non-core assets and finance core assets. Our consolidated debt-to-enterprise value is 30.3%, and our consolidated debt to EBITDA is 6.2x. Our debt mix is balanced with fixed-rate debt accounting for 89% of the total, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.73% and a floating-rate debt accounting for 11% of the total, with a current weighted average interest rate of 2.01%. 2014 maturities are just $142.3 million.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just curious if you can give us just a little more color on the EBITDA declines for D.C. It sounds like -- I know you still have some BRAC expiries this year, what part of the year were those? And then it sounds like, Mitchell, you thought occupancy would actually end the year higher. Can you just kind of walk through the components a little more?","Steven Roth","Joe will -- Michael, Joe will start with that and Mitchell can chime in.","Joseph Macnow","Michael, well, you remember that last year, we had a settling fee of $2.4 million, that's not reoccurring in 2014. Real estate taxes, the portion that's unreimbursed by tenants is increasing in 2014 versus 2013 by 1.3 million. As Mitchell mentioned, we're preparing a building at 2221 South Clark Street. So we work, that building's coming out of service, that's costing us $2.2 million in comparable EBITDA. And then Michael as you talked about, well, Mitchell said that he expects occupancy to tick up by the end of the year. During the year, it's actually going to be down by about 100 basis points, plus\/minus. That lower occupancy during the year will reduce EBITDA versus last year by $5.5 million, which will tick up again by the end of the year if our projections are accurate and reasonable, and so 2015 should be much, much stronger.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like '14 is the bottom for your EBITDA there?","Joseph Macnow","That's what we think.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then second question, can you guys just talk generally about your plan, sources and uses of capital? And maybe it sounds like you're going to be funding developments still, and maybe not buying a whole lot. Can you just maybe touch on where you think we should all think about development or redevelopment yields for the projects you're working on?","Steven Roth","Well, let's see. There's multiple questions there, Michael. In terms of our sources and uses, we are highly liquid. We are getting more liquid as we continue to simplify and sell assets. We are using that liquidity to -- we have unencumbered some assets and paid off hundreds of millions of dollars of debt, which is not a long-term strategic imperative, it's principally paying off as early as we can, and assets in -- before we sell it, what-have-you. So we're lowering our debt levels, paying off debt. We're also funding a lot of our development out of our balance sheet as opposed to with loans. So that's sources and uses.","With respect to development returns, did we publish that? We haven't published development returns and so I'll just comment about one, just for interest. We are building 699, let me call it 700, units of apartments on top of the Whole Foods in Pentagon City. We've had some people comment about \"Gee, the residential market is a little soft. Why are you doing that?\" Well, the answer is that if you -- the cost of the land is sunk, we own that, we own it free and clear, and if you take the incremental dollars that we are going to spend on that project -- and by the way, the delivery, that project will deliver in mid-'16, and the market will be, we think, different and better then. We're getting a mid-7% and even higher return on the incremental dollars. So in that kind of product, we think that that's a first-class return. So we think that's a good investment. We think that, that building will finance at much lower rates than that and would sell, if we decided to sell it, at a very favorable spread.","Operator","And our next question comes from George Auerbach with ISI Group.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Steve and Mitchell, you both mentioned the leases opportunity in D.C. I'm interested in how you see the economics of the lease-up. Where do you think net rents are today in TI packages? And how do you see the timing for a lease-up today versus how you would have underwritten it maybe 12 months ago?","Steven Roth","I'll take a little bit of that, and then Mitchell will chime in. So our internal budgets show that we will get to stabilized, meaning we will get back to where we were probably and hopefully in the beginning of 2017. Now that's a very specific statement which is not to be relied on. It's a budget. So the decline in EBITDA that we suffered, if it goes back to where it was, that's about an $80 million increase in our EBITDA from where we are today. So if you put a cap rate on that and you deduct the capital that we will get -- that we will expend to get there, that can give you some idea of value. And so I'll let you do the calculation because I'm not in the business of doing those kinds of projections, but it's an extremely -- it's a large number. And so if you look at it, you can look at it the glass is half-empty, the glass is half-full. You can say that our Washington business is struggling, it's under stress. We believe that our Washington business has bottomed. And if you look at it that it is now -- it has now a vacant space that we will lease over a period of time, a relatively, hopefully predictable period of time, our Washington business now becomes a high-growth segment. So that's an interesting way to look at it, which is actually the way I think the optimist looks at it because we don't believe that we have any credit for that empty space in our stock. You would never sell those buildings getting 0 credit for that space. So we believe that Washington is a growth business from here out. Mitchell, do you have anything to add, my friend?","Mitchell N. Schear","Yes. What I would just add specifically to George's question, and if you remember from my opening comments, our rents were down about $0.50 in terms of the total volume of leasings year-over-year from 2012 to 2013. I think that, generally speaking, the market is at a point where we don't expect concessions to deepen dramatically further, we don't expect rents to drop dramatically further. So I think we're seeing a pickup of both activity, and the activity is at reasonable leasing levels in terms of what we are accustomed to doing.","Steven Roth","Let me tack onto that just a little bit. I have said that I am very pleased that the rents in Washington are holding notwithstanding the soft market, okay? Notwithstanding that, our mission in Washington is to fill up that space. Mitchell is aggressive, his team is aggressive. We are fighting in the trenches for every deal and we are prepared to compete aggressively economically for every deal. Remember that every square foot that we full -- we fill down there is incremental increase to our EBITDA. So our objective is to make deals, be aggressive and fill up the space. A dollar or two, one way or the other, is what it may look in the statistics. Our objective is to be aggressive, and we have been and we will be.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","No, that's helpful. I guess, second question from me. Steve, the team has done a nice job over the last 2 years pruning the portfolio. As you look into 2014, what do you see as the next 2 or 3 steps you'd like to see take place?","Steven Roth","Well, George, we're getting there. We have more to do. We have -- as I said in my opening remarks, we have $1.1 billion in the -- out in the marketplace. Much of that, well more than half of it, is actually in documentation now. So we -- our first objective is to complete that. We have more sales coming. And then let me give you a feel for the way we see it: We will have completed a housecleaning. Toys\"R\"Us is winding down, JCPenney is gone, some of the other assets that we don't want are gone. The Merchandise Mart gone, LNR is gone. And then so we will have, by and large, cleaned house. What we will be left with is the New York business, the Washington business and the strip shopping center business, and let me say a little bit about each of those. In New York, the hot part of the market now, the active part of the market is retail and for-sale residential. Those are the businesses that are really white hot. We think we're in very interesting shape. We have, by far and away, the strongest, most important street retail business. The performance of that business is terrific. It will continue to be terrific as we roll over spaces. And as David said and I said, for the last 3 quarters, we have had triple-digit mark-to-markets, meaning the rents have doubled. So the hottest business in town is retail. Retail rents have grown at very strong compound rates over the last 5 or 10 years, and so we are very, very well positioned there, better than anybody. In terms of for-sale housing, we have the single best site, by far, our 220 Central Park South site. Now we remind you that residential housing, for-sale housing, is not our business. We're not nuts about this business, but on the other hand, we have this unbelievable site which we have spent 8 years assembling and what have you. Now over those 8 years, something very interesting happened, and that is the value of that land has doubled or maybe even tripled. So we will develop a tall residential building there. It will be, we believe, extraordinarily profitable and successful. And so while that's not a business that -- we only do 1 for-sale housing project every 10 years, but it's a lot. But the last one we did was the Beacon Court on top of the Bloomberg Tower. The third thing -- part of the marketplace which is extremely active and probably the most active part of the office sector is the tech, creative sector. There, we think we're also extremely well positioned. I mean we own 770 Broadway, which David talked about, where Facebook is and where AOL is and J.Crew. We think that's maybe arguably the single best building for that type of tenant in town. Interestingly, I -- interestingly, we own that building for about $100 million, maybe a shade, $120 million, something like -- some very -- some number in that regard. That building is worth -- what's the figure [ph]? Is that a -- was it an 8-figure number that I'm thinking of?","Unknown Executive","That's an 8.","Steven Roth","Okay. So that's -- that building is worth 10x what our cost is, just to give you a feel for the dynamics. In addition, as I've said before, the Penn Plaza District is where -- is -- everything seems to be tilting towards the Penn Plaza District. That's a combination of what's going on at Midtown South. It's a combination of what's going on at the Hudson Yards and what have you. And so the Penn Plaza District, with respect to its orientation, et cetera, will be likely the single most important focus of our business. In Washington, we have 2 things going for us. Number one is the vacancies we look upon as an opportunity. And as we fill up those vacancies, our earnings will rise and rise aggressively. We also have a huge development pipeline, all of which is close-in in Arlington County. So we think -- and the interesting thing about everything that I've just mentioned, all of this is on balance sheet now. We don't have to go out and make an acquisition. We don't have to go and pay 3 -- pay a 3 cap for some office building and hope the rents go up. These are growth opportunities which are on balance sheet now and all -- but -- what our job is, is to realize these, focus on these, focusing the business is really important, and sprinkle some CapEx, some development capital into it. Our strip shopping center business, which is the third leg of our three-legged stool, is -- will be shrunk down to basically the Northeast. We are exiting California, I guess. And if you look at the statistics of that business in terms of household incomes and populations and what have you, density of population, it is right up there at the very tippy-top of the strip shopping center competitive set. So there you have it. And that's what our program and our strategy is. I will not comment any more on what we might do beyond that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Steve, maybe just continuing on, on the strip center theme. If we look in your K, on the planned CapEx spend for this year, you have in excess of $200 million allocated for New York City and D.C. yet only $12 million for CapEx for the strip centers. Yes, just listening to your -- this shopping center peers, there's a lot of focus on repositioning, redevelopment, maximizing tenants right now as landlords have the leverage given the lack of supply. Is the $12 million really all that there is to spend? Or this is just sort of releasing money and there's additional monies that are being or potentially allocated towards the strip center to take advantage of the current environment?","Steven Roth","The beauty of the strip shopping center business is that it is a cash cow of the highest order. It requires very little or no maintenance CapEx. I think your observation is correct. In fact, we made a tour recently where we visited in 1 day 12 assets, and we noted that 1 of the assets really needs a facelift and a repositioning. So I think that you're right, we need to spend more money on the strip centers, and we will, okay? We have -- but we don't have enormous embedded repositioning and redevelopments in that portfolio. So we will spend more money, and you're correct to point that out, but it's not as if we can -- I don't expect we're going to have total knockdowns and teardowns and rebuilds. I mean the portfolio is fairly well positioned now. It's very stable, it requires very little maintenance CapEx, but you're -- we will spend more on that portfolio.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Second question is on the Crystal tech fund. If I heard you right, it's a $50 million fund that is seeded by Vornado. If you could just talk a little bit more as far as if you look at this fund as sort of like TI-marketing-type spend to try and spur tenants out to as you reposition Crystal City, and if there are any limits like VNO agrees to give up to $5 million or $10 million to this fund, or -- because I don't think you guys are planning to do, like, another JCPenney type, Toys side investments. So I just want to get better color how we should think about this and that it won't become another side investment like those two.","Steven Roth","You're correct. The -- our seed investment in that fund is $10 million out of a $50 million fund. The way we look at this is our job is to transform Crystal City, and Mitchell is doing a terrific job. The first, most important thing is the location of Crystal City. I mean it's contiguous to the national airport. It's on the shores of the Potomac. You can see the national buildings and the monuments from our buildings. So the location is superb. It had been historically basically a government location; that's changing. It's changing because of the dynamics of the marketplace. Our job is to attract private sector tenants to Crystal City and to our other holdings. And the best way to do that, and that's -- this is all Mitchell's hard work and innovation, is to see Crystal City with the type of tenant that we seek. So we're doing that with WeWork. We're doing it by putting in micro apartments. We're doing it by this tech fund. And we're doing it by numerous other initiatives. And so if we can attract these tenants by hook or by crook, and we look upon this feeding this fund as part of the bait, if you will, to improve the surround, improve the neighborhood, and to transform Crystal City, which we are very, very excited about, by the way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So you had commented that Crystal City -- or that Penn Plaza will be the single most important focus of your business going forward. Can you talk a little bit more about plans there and what we should expect over the next several years?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is no. I don't really think it's appropriate to get specific until we are really able to get specific, but generally speaking, the -- as David said in his remarks, Penn Plaza is full all the time. Penn Plaza is 97% occupied today. Over a 15-year period, through ups and downs, valleys and what have you, we have averaged over 96% occupancy. And when you think about it, that's an extraordinary statistic, and I might even -- if we did some homework, maybe even that's the best of any submarket in town. That's just a guess, I have no idea. The next thing is I think that we said 1 -- 2 quarters ago or whatever that it's the lowest-vacancy submarket in town. I don't really know whether that's still true, but it was a couple of quarters ago. So the demand is there. It's now at the crossroads of where the action is of the island, as I said, before is tilting towards us. So if you use the analogy, I mean I think what's going on around us is you can almost use the London analogy: What's going on around us is, to the west, we have Canary Wharf, I mean an enormous development which will be successful and whatever, but it creates an environment for us. So we are in board of that. We are on the other side of Manhattan South, and we think that we can change the dynamics of that marketplace by spending a fair amount of capital on the Hotel Pennsylvania and on our office buildings and on the streetscape and on the retail and on the restaurants. So we are about to get up to our eyeballs in that and we are extremely excited about it. We think it's the highest-return opportunity that we have in terms of investing capital. Now just to give you an idea of what could happen, I mean we average -- we have average rates -- rents in that district of $55 a foot. The competitive set marketplace is $25 or $30 or even more higher than that. So if you want to get space at Brookfield, if you want to get space at Related, if you want to get that building, rents are in the 70s and 80s. So we are the low-cost producer, which is good, but if we can get the marketplace and the market rents to go up by $10 a foot on 7 million feet of office space, that's $70 million a year. That's something to work very, very focused and hard for. So there's a big payday and we're very excited about our position.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And is this -- I mean how should we think about Hotel Penn? Do you think you keep it hotel? Or is it too early to tell?","Steven Roth","The answer is, while we are zoned for a 3-million-foot tower -- a financial services headquarters tower, and as I tell my children, you have to look at the deals that almost happened, so that was a deal that almost happened when we were -- we had 2 huge investment banks on that at one time. In any event, the -- it looks to me like the math does not support a tower today. We are nothing if not realistic, and our plan is -- I wanted to say our current plan, I'm going take out the word \"current.\" Our plan is to redevelop the Hotel Pennsylvania. Our objective there is multiples. Number one, we own that building for -- in the low hundreds of millions of dollars. It's worth 6x that or more. So our first objective is to get the hotel to be an asset to the neighborhood, not so much to make money in the hotel but to improve the neighborhood so that the value of our 7 million square feet of surrounding office space goes up. So that means we have to focus very hard on the lobby experience, on the hotel -- on the restaurant experience, the nightlife experience, what have you in that. The second is to make money on the hotel. And we believe every dollar that we put into that hotel in terms of renovation will be rewarded with very, very significant double-digit financial returns. Our third objective is to harvest some of the capital that we have in that building because the building is worth a lot of money, will become worth a lot more, and we have no debt on it and what have you. So that's our financial objective and our environmental objective, if you will, with respect to the hotel.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just finally, I guess, sort of just thinking through this simplification plan. As you think about long-term holds for the business, are you saying strip shopping centers you think will be a long-term hold, or you're considering selling those off?","Steven Roth","Now you're getting into a slightly fancier question, Jamie. And so the issue of spit -- spleen -- splits, dividing the company, all of those kinds of issues, which I think you're alluding to, let me attack that head on. And that is we are aware of all of the strategic and financial options that we have. We feel that we are well blessed by having a business that is performing wonderfully, obviously subject to cleaning up but performing wonderfully, has a great future. We are considering every one of the potential financial and strategic options that you can think of at the board level, at the management level and including some third-party advisers. So we have nothing to say now. I'm not alluding to anything, I'm not hinting at anything, I just think it's important that you know, because you asked the question, that this is something that is very high on our thought pattern. We are thinking about and focusing on these kinds of issues very hard. We are unable to predict and it'd be inappropriate to predict what's going to happen, but we're certainly thinking about it hard.","Operator","Our next question is from John Guinee with Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Very insightful comments, guys. Just a kind of a cleanup item. It looks like Toys\"R\"Us is unfortunately being valued by everybody at 0. What's the nature of the debt? It's about $1.86 billion. Is any of that recourse? Or is all of that fully nonrecourse to Vornado?","Steven Roth","There is -- Toys\"R\"Us, there is no recourse debt to Vornado. Vornado has no intention of investing any more money in Toys and Vornado has no liabilities or surprises that will come out of Toys back to the mother ship.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Excellent. And then second, I guess, Steve or Joe, 7 -- or maybe Mitchell, 7 million square feet of FAR [ph] extremely well located in the D.C. area. Is there a way that we can find that FAR [ph] easily on the your balance sheet or your 10-K and get a better sense for your basis so we know what the incremental value is, say, at $50 or $60 per FAR [ph]?","Steven Roth","There's a new page, brand-new, on the supplemental, which is page number...","Stephen W. Theriot","Page #37.","Steven Roth","The bottom half of Page #37, I think, directly answers that question. Those are GAAP book numbers, which in terms of what that fair market value of those assets are is -- I hate to say this with all my accountants in the room, meaningless. So what you will have to do is to take the -- take those item by item and apply your own concept of what each FAR [ph] is worth.","Joseph Macnow","John, as you remember, though, 4 million square feet is the incremental density permitted in Crystal City. So there's no land on -- vacant land to find any place. It's taking the buildings and making them taller.","Steven Roth","No, no, no. Hang on. Let's go into that for a minute, okay? So Mitchell did a spectacular job in getting a -- what do you call it, Mitchell, a rezoning?","Mitchell N. Schear","Are you talking about in the -- where is this, in Pentagon City?","Steven Roth","The Crystal City plan.","Mitchell N. Schear","Three-sector [ph] plan.","Steven Roth","So the sector plan allows us to build, building by building, 4 million feet more than the existing buildings are, but in order to realize that 4 million feet, you have to tear down the old building. So if you will, I think we've already talked about 1900 Crystal Drive, which is a building which is approved, which involves a teardown of a 300,000-foot building and a reconstruction of a 700,000 square-foot building. So from a cost point of view and a value point of view, you are basically -- the cost of the land will be the market value of the 300,000-foot building. That would be the land cost, if you look at it. So it's not for free.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Is that different from 1851 Bell?","Mitchell N. Schear","No, that's the same project.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's what we thought. Okay.","Steven Roth","Mitchell has a tendency of confusing me by readdressing his buildings every 2 or 3 years.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Attie with Citigroup.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Michael Bilerman here with Josh. Steve, I was wondering if you can just provide a little bit of granularity to the $1.1 billion of sales, which I think you said most of them are or a good portion of them are actually in documentation, or half were. I assume that total includes Beverly Connection, but maybe you can just give a little bit of granularity in terms of what's sort of in there, how much is non-income producing versus income producing. Is there a lot of debt on that $1.1 billion at all? And then maybe just talk about the size of the future pipeline. You've sort of said in your opening remarks we got more on deck. Just so we get a sense of sizing.","Steven Roth","Okay. Yes, it includes Beverly Connection, which is free and clear. Beyond that, I don't -- it will be -- a lot of this is in, hopefully, final stages of negotiation. I'm really not -- I don't think it's appropriate to go through the list of what's in that packet while we're negotiating these. The lion's share of it is -- has no debt on it, but it does include One Park -- a proportionate share of One Park Avenue in Manhattan, which we've announced is for sale by the fund. So it includes our proportionate share, which does have debt on it. The balance of it is -- help me here, I think the balance of this is debt free.","Unknown Executive","Yes.","Catherine Creswell","Correct.","Steven Roth","Now with respect to returns, just let me through -- look through this. One Park is income producing now. There's another large asset in there which is not income producing. Beverly Connection is being sold at a very, very low current cap rate because it's in ramp-up in stabilization, so that if you look at it from what our earnings will be penalized by the sale proceeds, so that is probably in the low 4s. Although, that's not a relevant number because the earnings will grow just from executed leases. So I hope that satisfies you, Michael.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful. And then in terms of on -- the on-deck circle in terms of potential sizing as you think about the next stuff that you start to bring into the marketplace and the execution of that. I'm just trying to get a sense of what's -- what else is out there after this 1.1.","Steven Roth","We're starting to huff and puff a little bit. We're running out of toys to sell. So we do have more, they are obviously in the hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars but not in the billions of dollars. Hopefully, we're getting to the end of the house cleaning, and then we're going to really focus on the main event, which is the assets that we own.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just a question. You said Wendy was in the room. I just wanted a question on the financing market. And you're in the process now of refinancing the office piece at 731, downsizing the loan modestly, but just talk about sort of how you're sort of thinking about total proceeds that were available in the overall financing market and as you think about the retail piece on that asset that comes due next year as we just think about overall the financing environment, especially in New York.","Wendy Silverstein","Well, certainly, overall, the financing environment in New York is very robust and for our assets. And one that we have in the marketplace right now that we're working on the loan for was very, very competitively bid. And so I have to say, overall, it\u2019s as robust as I've seen it certainly in the last several years. With respect to the Alexander's asset in particular, 731 Lex, not surprisingly, given the quality of that asset, we were able to achieve what will shortly be announced as a very, very competitive financing. It was the owners of that asset's decision to keep it very modestly leveraged. So essentially, what's being executed against that is a AAA financing, which as you would imagine is, as I said, a very low-priced deal. With respect to going forward on the retail financing, again, it's a little bit further out, but the quality of the assets, the nature of the tenancy, the productivity of the stores, I will again expect that to be extremely competitively financed.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And in terms of rate and term on the $300 million on the office piece and sort of how you think about leverage on that.","Wendy Silverstein","The office piece, as I said, is going to be a AAA financing, so it's very modestly leveraged. It will be done in such a way that there will be enough built-in flexibility because the proceeds on that could probably be easily tripled from where we're going to execute the financing at still relatively attractive rates, but at this point, Alexander's, which has a very liquid balance sheet with cash on the balance sheet and not a lot of activity which they're using to deploy that cash, is really not looking to sit on expensive cash balances. So at this point, it's going to be modest leverage but flexible enough so that if the ownership wants to change their strategy, they'll be in a position where they'll be able to do so easily.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of upside to their loan until they get money...","Steven Roth","But Michael -- is this call FD [ph] for Alexander's? Yes? Okay. So Michael, let me say that all -- let me just say it in a slightly different way, okay? Number one is, equivalent to the word downsizing, we're going to do $300 million for a $314 million loan, so I'll let you decide what that is. As Wendy said, we're doing -- the $300 million is fully all AAA at a very -- I mean it's 25% of the appraised value of the stack that is the collateral or the office deck that's the collateral. It will bear interest at the lowest rate that's in the marketplace, which is very low. The savings between the loan that's being paid off to the loan that's being taken is extremely large, plus this is an interest-only loan as opposed to an amortizing loan, so the change in the cash flow of Alexander's is a very significant number. The -- it's a floater so that -- the main purpose of it being a floater is that we can pay it off basically when we want to so that if we decide we want to get higher leverage or less leverage, we have total flexibility in that balance sheet. I look upon Alexander's as an income-producing security. And I believe Alexander's common stock should trade based upon the dividend yield. And so if we're able to save $1 of interest, and you cap that at, pick a number, 4% or whatever the dividend is, that creates value for our shareholders, one of -- the largest one of which, I guess, is Vornado. So our strategy there is to refinance. We don't want to keep huge balances of cash on our balance sheet with huge negative arbitrage. We want to reflect the interest savings through to our shareholders and create shareholder value. We want to retain flexibility on that balance sheet so that if we do decide we want to invest, we can refinance quickly.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. No, I was just thinking about it from the perspective of being able to tap significant mortgage and then maybe even pay -- effectively distributing the proceeds to its owners, of which Vornado is a large piece, and -- but I understand sort of the rationale that you're talking about. I just wanted to get an understanding of the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Michael just asked my Alexander's question. So Steve, I think the only big topic that hasn't been discussed is you in terms of just an update on timing CEO succession, your thoughts around that topic.","Steven Roth","Thanks, Ross. I think, no change. This is something that I and the board think about all the time. Our plan is to clean up the company, simplify the company, focus the company, make the decisions that need to be made; and when we get through that, then to basically take care of me.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Makes sense. You had an earlier comment before when you were talking about thinking through alternatives, where you said you had been working with advisers, is that something new, or has that been the case for quite some time now?","Steven Roth","Quite some time now.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So first, to follow up on the development returns. Even though you don't publish the numbers, could you comment directionally, as you make progress, any notable movement based on construction costs or pre-leasing activity? Are there any projects that might stand out as likely to be better or worse than originally contemplated, without sharing the absolute levels with us?","Steven Roth","Yes, I mean I can talk around that a little bit. I mean, for example, the deal that we're doing in Times Square, on the Marriott motel site which is across the street from our Forever 21 site or Virgin site, whichever you want to call it, will yield extraordinary returns on capital and create enormous value, but this is not a ground-up development. We're not talking about building in the -- in suburbia. I mean this is right in the heart of Times Square in Manhattan. Our 220 Central Park South, a for-sale condominium project, will yield extraordinary returns on the capital that's being invested in it, if in the end there is any capital investment in it. What am I missing? In -- the Hotel Pennsylvania will add -- will have double-digit returns on capital. Whatever capital we put into the Penn Plaza District, we expect, will yield high returns. We can't quantify them now because basically there's 2 elements to the return in -- of every dollar we invest there. There's the actual return on what we're doing, and then there's the knock-on effect of the return in improving the neighborhood, transforming the neighborhood, carrying onto the office buildings. Our investment in Springfield Mall is principally an investment to regain the sum cost of our land. So our incremental dollars that we're spending there will have double-digit returns, but when you calculate the return based upon 100% of the sum cost of the land and the incremental cost, we get to a market rate of return. The money that we're spending on 280 Park Avenue, as any building on Park Avenue, it's a single-digit return and it basically creates what we believe, together with our pals at SL Green, will be a transformative and best-in-class Park Avenue building. I've already talked about the 700-unit residential project in Pentagon City and the incremental returns on that. And I think that just gives you some color.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then secondly, on the retail side, there's a fairly significant portion of leases coming up for renewal in 2015. Just wanted to give you a chance to comment on the mark-to-market outlook on that portion. Is it too soon to tell? Or are you willing to say that there are strong signs that this is going to be a very favorable situation next year?","Steven Roth","With respect to the street retail expiries, we continue to be extremely pleased and extremely optimistic about the results we'll achieve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a couple of cleanup questions here. Just on the $2.3 million of EBITDA that's coming offline that was mentioned earlier in the call, in D.C., when does that actually come out? And is that an annualized number, or is that the amount for 2014?","Steven Roth","Vincent, I'm sorry, can you repeat the question? I didn't get it.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sure. Just a question on the $2.3 million of EBITDA that's coming offline out of D.C. sometime in 2014, when early in the conversation, you were talking about why or what was the components of the $10 million to $15 million reduction, just curious when that is coming out in the year and if that was an annualized number or that was the 2014 number.","Steven Roth","Okay, that's a great question. It's too technical for me. Joe, or Steve?","Joseph Macnow","Well, it is not an annualized number. It's the comparative diminution in EBITDA between '13 and '14. And the building is going to come offline pretty soon.","Mitchell N. Schear","March 31.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just going back to the CapEx side of things. I know you gave a lot of color on a by-project basis in terms of what you expect to spend in '14 and beyond, on a by-project basis. Just curious if there's much more on top of that you expect to spend in 2014 for projects that maybe are in earlier stages. So maybe said another way, what do you think the total development budget is for '14?","Steven Roth","The -- to the extent that the information is in our supplemental and in our K, that's fine. Other than that, I don't think I'm prepared to go further than that on this call.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Harris with Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Steve, it's been over a year since you raised the dividend. Could you talk about potential for further increases, particularly that the -- with regard to the fair book cover seems to be fairly tight?","Steven Roth","David, I think, as you know, our policy with respect to the dividend -- and by the way, this seems to be the policy of most of the blue chip REITs that I follow, is that our dividend will track our taxable income. And so as our taxable income rises, our dividend will rise. And so I mean I think that's the answer.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. Well, these calls have been such fun over the last 18 months or so. I'm just wondering whether you might take the next step and provide us with earnings guidance, particularly as the focus now is so much on core x Toys\"R\"Us.","Steven Roth","I think we'll take that under advisement, but I think that -- I think we'll take it under advisement, but I -- right now, we're pretty happy with our policies. And I'll give you just an indication of the way our management team thinks: So volatility in Washington and the noise around Washington was something that we thought we needed to have to provide to you all and our friends guidance for that because we thought it was volatile, it was something that everybody was -- it was the eye of the storm everybody's focused on. So we voluntarily provided guidance on that and we will continue to provide updates and guidance on that until we get to our objective. With respect to the balance of our business, as we simplify our business, we understand your point of view, we think it's a -- we understand your point of view. And we will -- certainly, we will talk about it and think about it. Thank you for raising it.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I just wonder how much simplification -- achieving the simplification goal is compatible with exceptionalism. I'll leave that thought with you.","Steven Roth","David, I didn't catch that. Can you give me that again, please?","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Well, I was saying, if the achievement of the goal is simplification, is it truly compatible with exceptionalism?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is that that's a metaphysical question of the highest order. But the answer to that is that if we simplify, okay, and you just take our New York City business, that's an extremely complex business, so by simplifying, might -- what that might mean is we're going to be in just a few geographies, but our New York City business, which has a best-in-class office portfolio, a best-in-class street retail portfolio, a hotel or 2, a -- the Alexander's assets and what have you, is an extremely complex business. Our Washington business is similarly complex with all the development and all of the moving parts there. So by simplification, I think that just means focusing. I prefer that better than simplifying. And I can tell you that the word exceptionalism is not a word in my vocabulary, but I love it and we will adopt it from here on in.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Yes, well, I mean the complexity of a business, I think, actually makes a powerful argument that management should be giving a steer to the investment and the market generally that -- about what future guidance, particularly now that you've removed some very big elements of exceptional volatility. Anyway, that's a whole debate we can perhaps have another time.","Steven Roth","Yes, well, we got you. Thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth for final remarks.","Steven Roth","Thank you, everybody. We spent 1.5 hours on this call. Our policy, as you know, is to answer questions until they are finished. And so we appreciate your attention. We appreciate your interest in our company. We appreciate your coverage. And we'll see you on the next call. When is the next call, by the way?","Catherine Creswell","May 3, 4, 5...","Steven Roth","We're stumbling over that answer, I shouldn't have asked it...","Catherine Creswell","May 5.","Steven Roth","May 5. So we'll see you then. Thank you, all, very much. Have a good day.","Operator","And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. And thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Catherine Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust fourth quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our fourth quarter earnings release and filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents as well as our supplemental financial information package are available on our website, www.vno.com under the Investor Relations section.","In these documents and during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.

The Company does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","On the call today from management for our opening comments are Steven Roth, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and David Greenbaum, President of the New York Division. Also in the room are Michael Franco, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer; Joseph Macnow, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer; Mark Hudspeth, Executive Vice President and Head of Capital Markets; Matt Iocco, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Tom Sanelli, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, New York Division.","I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. 2018 was a good year. Here are some highlights. Our leasing activity for the year across the entire business including New York, theMART, 555 California Street and Retail, totaled over 2.6 million square feet and 230 leases with industry-leading mark-to-markets of 25.6% GAAP and 18.4% cash.","At year-end, office occupancy across the board was 97%; and retail occupancy was 97.3%. These numbers in the very high 90s are typical of our performance year-in and year-out over the past 20 years. Thanks to Glen, and our best in the business leasing team.","We have begun closings that are 220 Central Park South super-tall condominium project. In the fourth quarter, we closed 11 units aggregating $222 million with a $67.3 million after-tax gain. And we have already closed in just the first five weeks of this year, another $290 million. Closings will continue throughout 2019, as we climb up the building. And the last of the 27 large full floor apartments in the tower is now committed and under contract. I'm guessing that this is the most successful project ever, anywhere.","We increased our ownership in the Moynihan Train Hall Farley project from 50% to 95%. We are in full blown construction here. And in 2020, we will deliver the best creative space in Manhattan. We love this asset. It is the link between our Penn Plaza neighborhood and Hudson Yards. It is a doublewide block with 150,000 square foot floor plates and high ceilings. It is a horizontal campus in an iconic landmark building much like the horizontal campuses favored by our fan tenants in the West. It is a truly unique asset.","In the Penn District, we are under way to transform PENN1 and PENN2 to create a two building 4.4 million square foot campus right on top of Penn Station. It will include a three block, Grant Plaza along Seventh Avenue covered by a giant new bustle across the entire 400 foot frontage of PENN2.","This plaza will extend 70 feet out from the building and will be 50 feet above the street. It will serve a dual-purpose. It will be striking, creating a huge covered plaza in front of our 1.8 million square foot PENN2, and the main entrance to PENN Station. It will bring the neighborhood into the modern age.","And at the same time, we will create 140,000 square feet of very valuable new best-in-class creative space. The scale of our campus here will allow us to provide our tenants with the biggest and best unparalleled amenity package. Even a giant step forward from what many of you have seen that we have done at theMART. Considering our redevelopment plans and everything that's happening around us, we expect that incremental $30 uplift in rents here. This financial reward is the main event.","So putting 220 Central Park South and the Penn District together; big picture, our financial plan is to redeploy the proceeds of 220 Central Park South sales into the CapEx of Farley PENN1 and Penn2. Give or take, we expect to finance all this CapEx internally, probably with no or very little new debt. Given that the only cost of the capital coming out of 220 Central Park South is the accounting item capitalized interest, which in round numbers is about $25 million. This will be enormously accretive.","As is our custom, we published management's estimate of NAV in the fourth quarter supplement. Please see Page 22 of the supplement. Our spot NAV is $97 per share versus $96 per share a year-ago. The math here reflects an increase in office NOI, partially offset by an increase in the cap rate on street retail, the 4.5% from 4.25%, which we believe more accurately reflect current market conditions.","Last month, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.66 per share, at an annual rate of $2.64 per share, a 4.8% increase, this after a [7.78%] increase the year before. Based on yesterday's closing price, the dividend yield is 3.8%.","It is very encouraging that Amazon shows New York for half of HQ2 and that Google, Disney, Facebook and many others continue to expand and expand again and again making New York their second home. By the way, the other half of HQ2 is going to Crystal City, Virginia, on land, we contributed to our JBG SMITH spin-off validating investments we made years ago. This is a really big deal. Kudos to Matt Kelley and the JBG Smith team.","Here's an interesting tidbit that bodes really well for the future of New York. As David will tell you in a minute, a research piece just came out with the fact that New York has grown to be the leading tech city in this year's index overtaking San Francisco. The point here is that New York has been steadily growing in creative class workforce, in creative employers, and in creative infrastructure.","Now, I'd like to cover the financial math. Financial results for the full year are as follows: net income was $2.01 per share, compared to $0.85 per share for 2017. Total FFO was $3.82 per diluted share compared to $3.75 for 2017. FFO as adjusted was $3.76, compared to $3.73 for 2017, consistent with our comments at the beginning of the year that 2018 would be flat. 2018 cash basis FFO as adjusted was $3.73, compared to $3.48 for 2017, up a strong 7.2%.","Companywide cash basis NOI for 2018 was $1.338 billion, compared to $1.315 billion for 2017. 2018 cash basis same-store NOI increased 3.9% as follows. New York office was up 7.5%. Retail was essentially flat down two-tenths of a percent. The total New York segment was up 4.3%. Retail produced $324.2 million of cash NOI at 2018, well ahead of the $304 million minimum we guided in the beginning of the year, which we increased to $315 million minimum in the third quarter.","theMART was down a funky 6.5%, as a result of a fourth quarter $12.1 million additional real estate tax accrual. This is essentially a timing mismatch between the GAAP required expense accrual in 2018, and the actual payment which we will make in 2019, which is when we will bill our tenants and collect approximately 80% in reimbursement income. Excluding this mismatch, theMART same-store would have been positive 8.8%. At 555 California Street, same-store was up 18.1%.","For the fourth quarter, our results are as follows: net income was $0.53, compared to $0.14 in the prior year's fourth quarter. Total FFO was $1.10 compared to $0.80 for the prior year's fourth quarter. FFO as adjusted, which excludes non-recurring items was $0.90 compared to $0.98 in the prior year's fourth quarter.","FFO as adjusted for this quarter was negatively impacted by the following items: $12.1 million, or $0.06 from the already mentioned additional real estate tax accrual at theMART. $10.5 million, or $0.05 from expected retail vacancies and lower income from a few short-term deals; and $6.2 million, or $0.03 from expected vacancy as 90 Park Avenue and theMART. Space out of service at PENN2 and 825 Seventh Avenue and lower office termination fees. Of course, there were many positives, which partially offset these items. This is all, the normal EBIT flow of our business.","We run the business for cash. Here are the cash numbers for the quarter. Cash basis FFO was adjusted with $0.91, compared to $0.90 for the prior year's fourth quarter. This quarter's company-wide cash basis NOI was $324 million, compared to $342.3 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. This decrease is primarily due to the additional 12 midpoint one-year real estate tax accrual at theMART in the fourth quarter and the sale of our interest in 666 Fifth Avenue in August.","Cash basis same-store NOI decreased by 1.7%, this flattish number masks a very healthy business. Here are the details. New York office was up a sound 5.8%, retail was down and anticipated 4.1% based on scheduled lease expiries and reduced rents on short-term renewals.","The total New York segment was up 1.9%. theMART same-store number is so heavily skewed by the real estate tax mismatch, that the number is not meaningful. Excluding this mismatch, theMART same-store would have been positive 2.7%. And 555 California Street was up a very healthy 15.8%.","Our Office business continues to perform very well. We continue to experience a robust demand from all matter of industries in all of our sub-markets. As I have said before, our tenants are optimistic, aggressive, growing and upbeat about New York.","Retail continues to be soft, albeit, we are finding sales volumes are leveling and there is increased retailer activity and tours. The two strongest retail sub-markets in town are Time Square and Penn Station, where we are the largest owner with the best assets.","And here I want to make a plug for the 120,000 square feet of retail we are developing in the Moynihan Train Hall at Penn Station. In addition to the teaming streets and the existing traffic in the nation's busiest train station, all the pedestrian traffic to and from Hudson Yards and Manhattan West will funneled through us. As you would expect, we have tremendous retailer interest in this unique space. David will give you more facts and details in a minute.","Turning now to investment sales. After a slow start to 2018, the investment sales market strengthened over the course of the year ending strongly. Investor appetite for New York City office continues to be healthy though disciplined with a good mix of domestic and foreign capital sources easily replacing declining activity from China.","Demand for assets in the West and South of Manhattan and for smaller assets continue to be stronger, but investor interest is also active in midtown. Pricing has stayed fairly constant with cap rates in the mid fours. The market has suffered from a shortage of available quality product on offer and with a fair amount coming out in 2019, should get off to a strong start.","The debt markets continue to be constructive very strong in the first three quarters of 2018, but signaling caution and volatility in the fourth quarter. All in borrowing rates remain low by historical standards. It's interesting to note that for us, secured non-recourse financing which is our main stay is now cheaper than unsecured public market full recourse financing by 25 basis points for sure and maybe even more.","We have a highly liquid fortress balance sheet with $3.3 million in immediate liquidity, measured leveraged and well staggered debt maturities. And this doesn't count a couple of billion dollars to come from 220 closings and non-core asset sales.","Thank you. Now to David.","David Greenbaum","Steve, thank you. Good morning, everyone. 2018 was a historic year in Manhattan. We leased a total of 42.2 million square feet, the most active year in two decades, including 61 leases of 100,000 square feet or greater with 20 of those deals greater than 250,000 square feet. This enormous rising activity is due to the continued strong job growth in New York, both private-sector employment at 3.98 million jobs and office using employment at 1.4 million jobs are at all-time high.","Manhattan's overall average asking rent ended the year at a record $76 per square foot with Class-A midtown rents north of $80 per square foot. The overall availability rate remained steady and actually went down in Midtown, even in the face of the delivery of some 2 million square feet of new construction. Financial service tenants continued to be a strong player in the Midtown market accounting for 41% of all leasing activity.","Large tenants continue to be attracted to new and redeveloped product, which captured significantly almost two-thirds of the year's leasing activity. The Landmark announcements made by JP Morgan Chase to develop a new corporate headquarters on Park Avenue, Google's commitment to a campus on Hudson Square, Disney's announcement to build a new headquarters also in Hudson Square, Deutsche Bank's commitments in Midtown, Pfizer's commitment to Hudson Yards, and finally, Amazon's selection of Long Island City for half of its second headquarters location, all reflect upon the great strength of this city.","Just last week, Sable's the international brokerage house issued its Annual Global Tech cities report. Sable's concluded that New York ranked first, as the world's foremost center for tech, due to its deep talent pool providing the business environment, lifestyle and quality of urban infrastructure to position New York as the attractive location for both start-ups and multinationals alike. Our portfolio of redeveloped assets has experienced the benefit of enhanced demand from tenants and Farley PENN1 and PENN2 are up next.","Reflective of the strong overall marketplace in New York, as well as River North in Chicago and San Francisco, Vornado's portfolio across all three cities delivered very strong results. For the year 2018, our leasing team has completed 230 leases, a total of 2.5 million square feet of activity, an exceptionally strong mark-to-markets across the board of 25.6% GAAP and 18.4% cash.","Focusing on our New York Office portfolio, for the year, our team completed 113 office leases, totaling over 1.8 million square feet at an average starting rent of $79 per square foot with strong, strong mark-to-markets of 33.7% GAAP and 22.7% cash. We remain full, with year-end occupancy at 97.2% and a very modest 625,000 square feet expiring during 2019, with approximately half of the expiring space coming from the to be redeveloped PENN1 and PENN2 campus.","Tenants in New York are growing. 38% of our activity in 2018 was with tenants new to and expanding in New York City, real, real growth in the city. Looking at the last three years, our leasing performance in the portfolio totaled almost 6 million square feet, at an average starting rent of $76.50 per square foot, underscoring a very high quality of our offerings and a strong profile of the tenants in our buildings.","During 2018, our trophy assets also continued to shine highlighted by 11 triple-digit transactions, totaling 445,000 square feet, comprising fully a quarter of our total annual activity at an average starting rent of $109 per square foot. Our New York Office 2018 same-store results show robust growth of 7.5% cash and 4% GAAP.","Now turning to the fourth quarter, we executed on 479,000 square feet across 27 transactions at an average starting rent of $73 per square foot and positive mark-to-markets of 6.9% GAAP and 1.2% cash.","Same-store growth during the quarter was a strong 5.8% cash, while GAAP was essentially flat. Notable fourth quarter leases included a new headquarters for sublease international at 650 Madison Avenue on the entire 38,000 square foot second-floor with this luxury residential brokerage house will take advantage of these buildings premier location, great branding opportunities and abundant outdoor space. This space previously was retail space, which we now have converted to office taking advantage of the highest and best use for this space similar to what we did with Kmarts third floor, at 770 Broadway.","In the fourth quarter, we also relocated CICC, one of China's leading investment banking firms from our 350 Park Avenue into 20,000 square feet at 280 Park Avenue, where they will double inside. And the Interpublic Group expanded again at 100 West 33rd Street by 44,000 square feet, bringing IPG's total footprint there to 662,000 square feet.","As we kick-off 2019, we are seeing very active demand in the market, but leases in negotiation totaling 460,000 square feet across all sub-markets, and another 600,000 square feet of deals in the pipeline. At 1290 Avenue of the Americas in 90 Park Avenue, two of our completely redeveloped buildings, we have seen multiple tenants bidding on the blocks of space available and our sweet spot in the market in the $80 per square foot to $90 per square foot range.","Now turning to our office development and redevelopment pipeline, where we remain very active. We've recently completed and brought to market the new build 170,000 square foot office building at 512 West 22nd Street, directly on the High Line, where we are in active dialog with multiple tenants.","Notably, these discussions are mainly with boutique financial services tenants, looking for a new home in Chelsea. As we have said in the past, the geographic boundaries for tenants in Manhattan to continue to expand, as demand for this type of product in this district is at an all-time high, rents in Midtown South for this product have now surpassed Midtown asking rents.","Construction progress at Farley continues, where you can now really get a sense of the grandeur of the new Train Hall. The Train Hall's mid-block Skylight, one of two signature skylight is now complete. The skylight toward 50 feet above the mid-block whole that will include our retail restaurants and one of our three office lobbies.","The work on our office core and shell program has commenced with initial delivery anticipated by mid-2020. We are seeing great office and retail interest in the project from all industry types, as we are presenting the vision of this horizontal campus to brokers and tenants on almost a daily basis.","PENN1 is a tone setter for the new Penn District neighborhood, where we will create a hospitality rich communal workplace for our district-wide tenants from the lobby to the second and even to the third floor. Physical work has commenced both our facade restoration and elevator modernization programs have begun.","We've completed the necessary arrangements to relocate office and retail tenants at the base of the building, which will allow us to begin the real construction work on this transformational project, once these tenants move this coming summer.","At PENN2, we are finalizing our plans and permits with construction to commence during the first quarter of 2020. Here we have completed the necessary tenant relocations to make way for this fill building capital program, delivering 1.8 million square feet of unique modernized office space along with all new retail offerings, outdoor plazas and multiple amenities, which will also serve our tenants district-wide.","Collectively, the projects we are undertaking at Farley PENN1 and PENN2 are the catalysts to our recreation of the Penn District neighborhood in the epicenter of the new, New York. I encourage you to take a look at our Penn District plans, which are now posted on our website at www.vno.com homepage.","Now turning to our flagship New York retail portfolio, for the year, we leased a total of 255,000 square feet. Same-store results were flat year-over-year, negative 2.2% GAAP and negative 0.2% cash. Retail portfolio occupancy stands at a strong 97.3%.","During the fourth quarter, we completed nine retail leases comprising 26,000 square feet with positive mark-to-markets of 3% GAAP, and 1.1% cash. Notable deals included a lease with HSBC Bank at our new 606 Broadway in SoHo, Wells Fargo's lease of the entire retail box at 968 Third Avenue and the announcement of Ballast Point breweries first New York location at 330 West 34th Street.","Ballast Point will bring their West Coast craft brewery and restaurant concept to the Penn district, but they will have an indoor restaurant experience on 34th Street, and an outdoor Garden for its patrons on 33rd Street, directly across the street from what will be the main entrance to our future Farley building office occupancy.","We also completed a lease for a new flagship location with Krispy Kreme at the Crowne Plaza Hotel at the corner of 48th Street in Broadway, which will include a 4,500 square foot retail component as well as a large exterior digital signage presence.","At theMART in Chicago, 2018 results reflect continued strong leasing performance at this 3.7 million square foot campus. We completed 243,000 square feet of leases for the year, comprised mainly of a variety of showroom tenants and very strong starting rents of $53.50 per square foot.","During the fourth quarter, we completed 46,000 square feet of showroom deals at an average starting rent of $61 per square foot with positive mark-to-markets of 8.7% GAAP and 3.2% cash. We currently have in office lease out for 36,000 square feet with a well-known technology company and have multiple other prospects, the remaining space vacated last year by Publicis on floors four and five.","In San Francisco, we completed a stellar year at our 555 California Street campus taking full advantage of this marketplace, where the demand for space continues to surge amid limited availability. Our same-store results for the year were a very strong 14.9% GAAP and 18.1% cash. In 2018, we leased 249,000 square feet at an average starting rent of $89 per square foot resulting in very healthy mark-to-markets of 34.3% GAAP and 13.4% cash. We are now at 100% occupancy.","At 315 Montgomery, we do have a renewal leasing negotiation for 56,000 square feet, which we expect to close during the next few weeks. And our 345 Montgomery redevelopment work is in full force with concrete work substantially complete and steel work having begun.","We remain on time with respect to our delivery of the building to reach spaces by the end of the third quarter of this year. We are very pleased with our overall 2018 companywide results and continued to see strength in all three of our markets. These leases are credit to the quality of our portfolio and the dedication and teamwork of all of our enormously talented professionals. Back to Steve.","Catherine Creswell","We're ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question in the queue comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore. Your line is open.","Stephen Sakwa","Thanks, good morning. Steve, you and David both kind of mentioned the Amazon situation. I know there's been a number of different press reports out there about maybe the city, having some issues coming to terms with Amazon on the Long Island City project. And I'm just wondering, what that sort of signals as it relates to kind of new business coming here and kind of any thoughts you have around that deal maybe getting consummated?","Steven Roth","That's a hot potato. First of all, folks like Google and Facebook and on and on and on have no trouble expanding growing relocating, locating in New York through the conventional way of dealing with basically as of right real property. Amazon chose to take a different tact. And that's fine. I would say, it's my personal opinion that if - it's my personal opinion that the deal that the Governor of New York and the Mayor of New York made with Amazon was a terrific deal for the city and a terrific deal for us.","I mean a huge company with an enormous number of important high paying jobs et cetera. If the political climate in New York blows this deal, it would be the stupidest damn thing I've ever seen. And that's what I think. Now we have, as I said before, obviously, we are heavily involved and I'm the Chairman of the company, the Crystal City company, which is welcoming. So I think maybe some of the folks in the auction to take a much more welcoming savvy point of view on this deal.","Stephen Sakwa","Okay. My second question, as it relates to kind of the buyout at Farley, I think your overall cost in that deal might be sort of around $1,100 a square foot. I'm just wondering if you could sort of talk about your expectations sort of for leasing at Farley timing and remind us what your expectations are for a return on that project?","David Greenbaum","Steve, good morning. Listen, we think the Farley Building as a horizontal campus in New York. It is totally unique in terms of the space that we will be delivering. We have told you in the past, that we think rents at this building are triple-digit numbers and by the way, as you think about rents in the city, generally, when I mentioned earlier, some 44 million square feet or 42 million square feet of activity for the year, some 4.2 million square feet across the city last year was leased at over at over $100 rents.","So these triple-digit rents as it relates to redeveloped and new construction clearly have become the norm. We think again our building is differentiated in a significant way from substantially all of the new well called vertical product. We remain in discussion with a number of tenants for this space. As I said, the space will be delivered for tenants to begin build out sometime by the middle of next year, very excited about the fact we now own 95% of this asset.","Steven Roth","Yes. Our financial plan here Steve, is that we are basically going to build this deal with cash. Cash coming out of 2020, so that our cost of capital here is the lowest in the - the lowest that it's possible to be. And we have enthusiastic - very enthusiastic reactions from the brokerage community and the tenant community. And as I said and David also said, we love this one.","Stephen Sakwa","Okay. And then I guess my last question just around the uplift, you talked about it, I guess, 2PENN and maybe the uplift at 1PENN. I think you quoted a $30 per square foot figure. Just kind of help us think through how you're sort of framing that out, or thinking about the uplift in sort of the rent differential that you would expect there to be between some of the new product that Manhattan West and Hudson Yards and maybe ultimately your finished project at 1PENN and 2PENN?","David Greenbaum","Well, I mean, I think it's pretty simple. The in-place rents are high '50s, low '60s, on average with current leasing being a little bit higher than that, but the average in the buildings are those numbers. We think the finished product will be worth in the marketplace. Let's say, pick a number, $90 a foot. So that's a $30 uplift. Now out of that uplift has become a marginal increase in expenses, the cleaning doesn't get to be any higher or the operating doesn't have to, the taxes may go up a little bit. So basically, that's a fairly pure number, and we're pretty excited about it.","We determine what we believe, the future market - we got to remember this is trended now for a couple of years. We determine what we believe the future market will be, based upon what we see all around us, what new building, new builds are going forward, other spaces going forward and the fact that we have the best location on top of Penn Station. And we have experience in transforming these buildings both at theMART and in New York at many different occasions. And we have history and what the transformation yields in terms of tenant demand and pricing. So that's our best judgment and we're pretty certain we're right.","Stephen Sakwa","Okay. That's it from me. Thanks guys.","David Greenbaum","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open sir. Please proceed.","Emmanuel Korchman","Hey, good morning, everyone. Maybe if we can just sector Farley for one more second. In the past, you've discussed a potential life science component there and build out to support that. And now it sounds like you are squarely focused on a more traditional, if you will, tech tenant. Am I reading that correctly?","Steven Roth","You know, maybe, where an equal opportunity landlords, I mean, when an important tenant at the proper pricing comes in, a strong tenant, we're very happy to welcome everybody with open heart. So we have some interest from science tenants, we have more interest from creative class tenants, we even have interest from some fairly significant financial firms. So once again, this is not a special purpose building. It's a building designed to service the entire market.","Emmanuel Korchman","Thanks for that. And then in terms of street retail transaction activity has been a little bit lighter. What gives you confidence that cap rates haven't moved up more than the 25 basis points, Steve applied to the cap rates in your NAV analysis. And maybe with that, can you talk about the potential new legislation related to a vacancy pack?","Steven Roth","The cap rate we put in this year's NAV is our best estimate of what the marketplace is. So it's a very thin marketplace, but these great scarce unique assets trend pricing that - we believe we've hit it right on the button, okay. The second question was what about legislation, Manny?","Emmanuel Korchman","On the retail vacancy tax, it's getting proposed, I guess for the umpteenth time?","David Greenbaum","Well, I think the key thing there is the umpteenth time. Everybody is concerned about the fact that there are lots of vacancies on the streets of New York, it's not good for anybody. It's especially not good for the landlords. Okay. So I don't understand why the politicians - and we talked to these folks all the time. I don't understand why the politicians don't recognize the fact that it's landlords want to fill this space up more than they want the space filled up.","And so obviously, the landlords that are professional will go to the clearing price for the space. So I think it's extremely what's the word, it's a bad piece, it's a bad idea both in concept then in execution. And I don't make predictions, but I'm fairly confident that it will go, it will pass by. By the way, just as I'm saying, we're confident - just as I'm going back to what Steve said, that just as I'm fairly confident that the Amazon deal will get completed.","Emmanuel Korchman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thank you and good morning. It sounds like you'll have a lot of move-ins and move-outs in the portfolio for the rest of the year and even as you're kind of getting ready for the 2PENN redevelopment emptying out that building? Are you able to give us more color on what same-store NOI could look like, what earnings could look like? Just some, a bit of a guide as we kind of - as you get the portfolio ready for those big changes?","David Greenbaum","Yes, you're talking about guidance. And as you know, we don't give guidance. We do guide for what we think are extraordinary things. For example, when the patent office moved out and what was it, the BRAC when we had all of that dislocation in Washington, better part of 10 years ago, we did guide for that because we thought it was something that was very difficult to predict that everybody was focused on.","Last year, we did guide to what the minimum the retail cash NOI would be and I'm happy to say we missed it by $20 million to the positive side. So having said that, so we will think about your question because it's a valid question. I will tell you one thing. I for one as an operator don't understand how folks think about this. When we empty out a slug of space that's paying us $55 a foot to transform the building and two years later or 18 months later, we let that space for $90 a foot, we think that that's a huge asset and that's a very important part of our business and our colleagues as well.","So whereas - what I'm really saying is that I wish you folks would look upon the fact that we are going to kick out $50 tenants and move in $90 tenants as a huge uptick in shareholder value. We hear what you're saying about guiding and everything, we'll think about it, but that's not the normal way we run our business.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. That's a fair point. I mean, I think it's more just about setting expectations and I mean, I don't think anyone disagrees that it's the right thing to do to kick out tenants and redevelop the buildings, it's more just - so the market has a sense of what to expect as we are heading into quarterly earnings each quarter.","And then moving on, I know Manny had touched on cap rates. Can you just talk generally about your thoughts on the 2019 transaction market? You said you thought office will probably pick up in terms of volumes. Maybe what's on the market and what do you think cap rates will look like?","Steven Roth","Michael Franco is here, who is our Chief Investment Officer. I'm going to let him answer that question.","Michael Franco","So Jamie, good morning. I think after a pause coming in the year, there's a number of things that are hitting the market. Some new product like the condo, interested 30, Hudson Yards, you've got some other, call it, Midtown buildings, maybe lesser quality coming out on Lex, but I think the sweet-spot is going to continue to be that under $300 million to $400 million size, where a lot of the deals were last year. But we also have some bigger deals coming out, whether it's a couple of things that SL Green is putting out or some of the other assets in the Garment District.","So it looks like near-term, there's probably $5 billion to $6 billion of office product that is recently hit or will hit in the next 30 days. I think it's probably higher quality than what we saw for the bulk of last year and we'll see how it plays out, but I think the investor interest, at least from what we're seeing, hearing, is active and I think you're starting to see investors perceive value in Midtown as well, just sort of on a price per square foot standpoint, where most of the assets are trading for $1,000 a foot or less, which is, as we're seeing now, is some of the new builds that are going out at $2,000 a foot or north. That's a pretty attractive basis. So the market feels like it's picking up in terms of quality and I think we'll see investor interest reflect that.","Steven Roth","I would put my $0.02 and I agree with what Michael said. I think the first thing is that buildings have been pricing now at $1,000 a foot in that neighborhood a pinch more or a pinch less for years now. The investing marketplace has gotten used to that number and considers it to be fair value as I do. So there is no sticker shock and people are getting used to the pricing of what first-class Manhattan office buildings trade for. So I think that there is a very deep market of investors who want to invest in New York.","I think it's basically the strongest market in the world. We know what's going on in London, we know what's going on in Europe. I mean, Tokyo is doing great, that's a whole different kettle of fish. So what I'm saying is we think New York gets way more than its fair share. We think pricing - investors are used to the pricing and we're anticipating a strong investment sales market next year.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, thank you. And then finally, Steve, you had mentioned as source of capital non-core asset sales. Are you thinking more operating buildings or maybe you've seen a decent move in some of the REIT stocks, some of the equities you guys are holding?","Steven Roth","All of that is on the for sale list. I'm not going to predict timing and I'm not going to predict, which specific assets. But I mean, we were pretty transparent in what we intend to do to realize over $1 billion of sales. It's pretty obvious what we're doing in terms of timing those sales with our CapEx needs, et cetera. So that will all roll-out over time.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, thank you.","Steven Roth","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Adam Gabalski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Adam Gabalski","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just on street retail, given what we saw happen with rents in 2018, do you guys have any thoughts on where you could see street retail rents bottom and start to inflect positively? And also, whether or not Vornado is considering taking advantage of any distress you're seeing in the market?","Steven Roth","We love the stress, Adam. We can't wait for some distress. We have the capital base, the appetite and most importantly the expertise to be interested in growing in this asset class at fair prices or maybe even a little bit below fair prices, so there's that. We're not seeing a lot of that.","We're beginning to see the first inkling of assets going back to lenders now and so that's the beginning of that cycle. With respect to rents, the biggest problem on rents are that there are fewer tenants trolling the marketplace looking for space. So we don't yet know what the bottom price is.","If you follow this market as most other markets, it will take a while, maybe a year, maybe two years for some of these vacancies to be cleaned up by bottom fishers and then the market will level and start to grow again. So we have the enviable position of not really having - I mean, we have a vacancy here, we have a vacancy there, but in terms of the mass of our portfolio, it's under lease for long-term with good tenants and so we're fine.","Adam Gabalski","All right. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just one more on street retail, I know the Massimo Dutti and Westbury expirations got pushed out a little bit. Can you just talk about the latest update on those leases and then what the impact will be to street retail NOI in 2019?","Steven Roth","Once again, that's a guidance question. I don't think the Massimo Dutti lease was pushed out. So I don't think that and the neighboring MAC lease has - goes into the 20s, 24 I think. We have people cruising the Massimo Dutti space. We have nothing to report yet.","Adam Gabalski","All right. Thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning. Steve, I appreciate your comments on guidance. So I guess, let me try to ask it this way. If we look over this year - well, Steve, you got to try, right, every New Yorker has got to try. If you look over earnings this year and next, obviously theMART had - you guys created values, the taxes went up, you'll recoup part of that, but still that's a net headwind.","PENN2 is going to come offline, I think, next year. So that's some NOI that will come off in the near term, obviously you guys will boost rents and grow it eventually. But you then have the Cube at 555 that will get filled and produce NOI.","So just with all the different pieces that are coming and going, including some of the street retail vacancy that - I mean, street retail that you talked about before. Directionally, do you see over this year to next that net NOI will be growing, stay flat or reduce just with all the different moving parts?","I think to Jamie's question, earnings have been flat the past few years. So just trying to get a sense for how, directionally, people are thinking about it because I think we all agree you're creating value at the NAV and property level, but just from an FFO, that part stays flat?","Steven Roth","I don't want you to hold me to this, but I would just say, directionally, if you think flat, that would be a good thought. Okay? So there is - I mean, the business is, some people refer to it as noise. I refer to it as the normal ebb and flow of our business. Tenants move in, tenants move out, rents go up, rents go down, whatever, okay.","So if you take it all together, the office business in three different jurisdictions, arguably the best building in San Francisco, arguably the best financial asset in Chicago and our New York business and our retail business, overall, I think it will all known together as flat, but that's not a guide and don't hold me to it. Okay.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is just bigger picture, I guess, this morning or yesterday Silverstein said, he may go spec Downtown, obviously Brookfield has talked about going spec on the Far West Side. Do you view this as marketing bluster, like trying to drum up business or are you concerned that we could suddenly have another supply wave, where we're just sort of working through the previous few years of supply delivery, which has pressured rents in New York?","Steven Roth","Hey, these are major, major people. They don't bluster, okay. They may bullshit a little bit, but they don't bluster. So you got to remember that both of these firms are firms that deal with promoted third-party capital, okay. So what their - my guess is and I haven't talked to either of them about this, if they can get the - an investor who has the appetite, they'll build the building, why not, okay.","So I think that's totally possible and whatever. There is a large appetite of invested capital for buildings for - even for development and brilliantly located spots, like Park Avenue for example. So I have no idea what Larry and Rick are going to do and they're both seasoned guys. Rick has got fund money that he has discretion over, so he can build it if he wants to. Larry will raise third-party capital if he can and we'll see what happens.","Alexander Goldfarb","But you're not concerned about another supply sort of glut pressure in rents though, it doesn't sound like?","Steven Roth","A building here, a building there, a building in the next place, these buildings, they won't take five, seven years to create. They are like pulling teeth. They will not have a dramatic influence on the 400 million square foot New York City office business. The last time that this happened was in the early - in the 80s, where there was a zoning change and then the entrepreneurial developers, there was a rush to beat the zoning change and 20 million or 30 million square feet was created in one slug. That is not happening now and will not happen now.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you, Steve.","Steven Roth","By the way, as an aside, okay, we love to build new buildings. I mean, we're pretty good at it. We have - we built the Bloomberg building, we built 220, so we know how to do it. It's part of our skill-set. But our main business is in the core of properties that we own now. And if somebody is going to build a new building and get $120 a foot rents for it, that creates the absolutely wonderful price umbrella that we function under in the $80-$85, $90-$95, $100 range. Okay? So that's all fine.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you.","Steven Roth","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please proceed.","John Kim","Thank you. Thanks. Just want to follow-up on Alex's last question. Given Manhattan West directly competes with Penn Plaza, does that potentially change the timeline of the redevelopment of PENN2?","Steven Roth","Absolutely not. Absolutely not. PENN2, we are going as fast as we can on PENN2. We're going to deliver the product as quickly as we can. We think it's unique product and we think that's all fine. The more people that are in our neighborhood in first-class property with first-class tenants, the better it is for the entire neighborhood, us included. So we don't look upon them as a competitor, we look upon them as a colleague and as a good neighbor.","John Kim","Okay. With your NAV at $97, can I just ask what your updated views are on a share buyback? Given you now trade at a 28% discount? And I don't know if you saw this morning, but Simon just announced a $2 billion buyback program during the call?","Steven Roth","No, I didn't see that. Our views on the buyback are the same as we have communicated over the last year or so.","John Kim","Which is you look at it, but it's lower on the priority list?","Steven Roth","The answer is that our views would change if somebody were to do a buyback that was successful. So that hasn't happened yet and so we'll watch and learn, keep our money in our jeans and we'll see. So the answer is, it's right - as of right now, our thinking about buybacks is pretty much the same as it's been over the last year or so.","John Kim","Okay. And then a final question, this might be for Joe. But at 220 Central Park South. You had on your balance sheet condo units ready for sale at $99 million and that's lower than what you've already closed in January. So I'm wondering, if this is a good indicator of what you plan to close on over the next quarter going forward?","Joseph Macnow","I think in Steve's remarks, he commented that through the first five weeks in January, it was another $290 million. We anticipate substantial additional closings in the remainder of 2019 and quarter-by-quarter they will be more reclassified for accounting rigors into that category, that's your question. But yes, we expect substantially more closings. Remember, all of the full floor apartments have been sold for the remainder of 2019.","Steven Roth","Check me on this Joe. My understanding of the accounting convention is that when an apartment gets a TCO, a temporary certificate of occupancy, it gets reclassified into - on the balance sheet as apartments available for sale.","Joseph Macnow","That's correct.","Steven Roth","So that the number that you're looking at is - got nothing to do with sales, nothing to do with future financial activity, it has entirely to do with how many apartments in what order we have gotten because on.","Joseph Macnow","And this is number as of the end of the year, not a number into 2019. It will grow in 2019.","Steven Roth","And so our plan is that we get TCOs on the apartment serially as we go through right before we sell them. I hope that helps.","John Kim","Yes, it does. Is there a good run rate that we should be modeling? Is it $200 million to $300 million per quarter?","Joseph Macnow","No. We haven't given the information by quarter. And to take that noise out of earnings, we've shown it as non-comparable because, again, it is one-time, albeit over $3 billion in total. But no, we have not given that by quarter and I don't think we intend to.","Steven Roth","It's going to roll out over the next year, okay. I mean, pretty simply, whether it's another $100 million or $200 million, more one quarter or less one quarter, doesn't matter, it's going to all rolled out and be sold over the next year.","John Kim","Great, thank you.","Steven Roth","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. The next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay, thanks. Couple of questions, first on, how we should think about - you talked about the $25 million of capitalized interest from 220 Central Park South. I think the plan is to paydown debt from the sales of the condos, which would lower your interest expense, but then you are also losing that capitalized interest benefit over time. So can you just give us a feel for how we should think about that impact to your interest expense over the next year?","Joseph Macnow","Well. Hi, it's Joe. Good morning. We've said publicly that we're going to paydown the construction for its mortgage, which was originally in the amount of $950 million. At year-end was a little over $700 million. Today is a little over $400 million. And that - the balance of the proceeds are going to be used, as Steve said earlier, to fund the needs of PENN1, PENN2, Farley, the entire pipeline of what we have in development.","We've shown you in the NAV $1 billion, that's not - and somebody wrote in one of the reports, that's an increase from the prior year quarter. It's really the same number and that comes from the $3.2 billion of sales proceeds $200 million of taxes is $3 billion, the cost of the job was $2 billion, that's $1 billion. So I think that's where we are.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay. I'm just trying to think about capitalized interest, which is at its highest level for your Company. Last year is kind of a benefit for interest expense and how does that change going forward as 220 Central Park goes away versus you spending on your new redevelopments?","Steven Roth","Centrally put, our financial plan is this. The first sales that come out of 220 go to paydown a secured loan of $950 million, which is now in the fours and will quickly go to zero. So that eliminates the interest expense for that loan. And by the way, that loan is the lowest cost of capital in the industry.","Then all of the capital that comes out after that, which is going to be the better part of a couple of billion dollars, okay, will go into CapEx or other purposes. So when you think about it, I mean, we are going to be building these buildings with no interest cost and therefore the profit in those buildings will be higher, the accretion to our P&L will be very substantial.","Nick Yulico","Okay, thanks. And then just going back to the Retail segment, can you - I know, you have the benefit this year from Levi's, Sephora, Forever 21 lease commencements. As the offsets you do have some of the move out, Massimo Dutti and then the expiration this year, I think there was also some temporary occupancy renewal item at Westbury. So do you mind just giving us a feel for the expirations and the move-outs, the temporary occupancy issue? I mean, how much of offset that is to your - the benefits you are getting from lease commencements and lease escalations in the portfolio?","Steven Roth","I mean, that's a detailed guidance question, again. Basically, in the beginning of last year, we said that our retail cash NOI would not go below $304 million, okay. That number was adjusted to $309 million because we bought back some of the Retail - it was the other way around, $309 million, we bought back some of the Kmart space in favor of Facebook, so that number went from $309 million to $304 million.","In mid-year last year, we said that that minimum number, this is a minimum guidance that we gave last year for Retail would be no less than $315 million cash NOI, okay. We came in the year at $324 million, okay. So we're happy about that. It's too sensitive a number for me to give you something off the top of my head. But once again, we are guesstimating that the retail business cash will be flattish this year.","Nick Yulico","Okay, thanks. Appreciate it.","Steven Roth","Yes, sir.","Operator","Okay. The next question queue comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Steven Roth","Jamie, welcome back.","Jamie Feldman","Thank you. Good to be back. I just had a quick follow-up, I don't want to prolong your call. But in the foot - on the 10-K on Page 31, you have a footnote talking about where you think you can get rents leased or kind of renewals done in 2019. And it looks like on office, you're looking at about an 11% leasing spread, it looks like on, should retail, you're looking at positive depending on where it is in that range, but generally positive.","I just want to get your thoughts on, are you seeing rent growth? Is this kind of a flat - a look at market rents being flat? I just want to get your thoughts on where market rents are going and if there's any way to tie this into kind of leasing spreads for the year that would be helpful?","Steven Roth","Jamie, first of all, my congratulations for ferreting that information out. I think that's genius. Joe, what are you guys saying?","Joseph Macnow","I was just going over with David that what Jamie is referring to is the office expiries in 2019 have an average embedded rent of $65.58 and Jamie took the midpoint of our guidance for what that will we let at and that was $73, so he did the math and said it's 11% mark-to-market. That's close.","David Greenbaum","So Jamie, I think the important point there is this - the number that's published. Effectively it is only relevant with respect to the 600,000 to 700,000 square feet, that's actually expiring next year. So it's not reflective of mark-to-markets across the portfolio, it's not reflective of where we think rents are across the portfolio, we're specifically looking at the space that's coming up over the course of the next year and in fact some of that space that's coming up comes in at 2 Penn Plaza, which in fact is going to go out of service.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then just...","Steven Roth","Jamie, your observation that next year's numbers will benefit from expiries at a low number in the mid 60s as opposed to $10 or $20 higher than that is a valid observation. So we do expect to have a low double-digit mark-to-market in 2019.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, thank you. And then just general sense of rent growth in the market...","Steven Roth","\u2026little higher. Go ahead, Jamie.","Jamie Feldman","Just general sense of rent growth. I mean, would you say rents are rising or would you say they're still generally flat?","David Greenbaum","I'll come back to what I said a little bit earlier, Jamie, and that is while if you look at a single spot number and say Manhattan rents generally over the last year went up 3%, 4%, 5%, whatever the number is, again I think the key is and we've emphasized this in any number of our calls is looking at the sub districts in the city, where we've seen the highest rent growth.","So I mentioned Midtown South, which obviously includes our West Chelsea assets, asking rents in Midtown South have increased dramatically over the last couple of years. The same thing is true obviously in Hudson Yards and in Manhattan West, where rents started out several years back in the mid 70s and those numbers today are in the triple-digits. The most telling thing as I said earlier is what we're seeing today is triple-digit rents are no longer a sticker shock to tenants as it relates to new product and redeveloped product.","So generally, I'd say we are seeing a bifurcation in the marketplace between buildings that are older buildings, not redeveloped, where rents are flat and maybe even trending down a bit to the redeveloped product and newbuildings, where we are seeing rents increasing. And then the other thing I would add to all this is from a concession point of view, we see concessions that basically have leveled off at this point in time. All encouraging from a net effective rent point of view.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. All right, thank you. And I have to be on a driver client is even smarter than I am that pointed that out to me, just full disclosure, but thank you for your help.","Steven Roth","That's all very interesting. I'm happy to give you the credit. Thanks.","Jamie Feldman","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question in the queue comes from Daniel Ismail with Green Street Advisor. Your line is open.","Daniel Ismail","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a quick one from me. On the NAV page, looks like you raised the cap rate for residential by about 50 bps. Can you provide any more color on that? And is that speaking to just weakness in the rising market in New York?","Steven Roth","We are not that smart to know whether it's exactly this or that or the other, we just thought 3.5 was a very aggressive number. It's a small number in our portfolio. It doesn't affect the NAV substantially and we thought the better part of conservatism and the better part of valor was to take it up a notch.","I am sure that the residential gang would fight me and say the number is really 3.5 or 3 or 2.5 or whatever it is, but we are comfortable with 4. And from our point of view, it doesn't make any difference, whether it's 3.5 or 4 in terms of the shareholder value of our Company.","Daniel Ismail","Fair enough. Thank you.","Steven Roth","But we have limited market knowledge. To support that, we have some. But I mean, we're not going to die on our sword over that number.","Operator","Okay. The next question in the queue comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Michael Bilerman","Hey. It's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Good morning, Steve. Steve, last July, late July...","Steven Roth","Hi, Michael. I was wondering, where you were hanging?","Michael Bilerman","I'm hanging. You made a comment last July, when talking about the NAV discount that you have fluctuate between being frustrated and being test. And you said, we can quote you on it, so I'm quoting you on it. The NAV went up over the course of the year, right? You've been executing and getting additional office NOI as the lease has started and a number of other value creating activities.","And so, I'm just wondering, at what point should the market expect any sort of future ways of narrowing this gap, and I know you've talked about the share buyback being not something that you'd want entertained because others haven't been successful at it in your mind. But when should we expect something else that that may occur, if anything?","Steven Roth","Once again, as I said before, we think we've done more in terms of restructuring our business, focusing our business, spinning off this, spinning off that, selling non-core assets, et cetera. Anybody in the entire industry and once again, we still think the stock is significantly undervalued. And we continue to work hard on it. We can't really tell you and we are not going to speculate and we're not even going to hint anymore as to what we might do. When we decide to do something, that's when we will announce it.","Michael Bilerman","Do you feel like the time to do something is getting shorter, given what's going on in the marketplace that you'd want to make a decision about what route to go to narrow this gap that arguably you've been frustrated with? It's not something that's a new and I totally agree with you of all the value creating things that the Company has done over the last number of years to highlight that value and increase that value. I just don't know whether you feel like time is getting short to want to take advantage in the marketplace that may be changing?","Steven Roth","What do you mean by take advantage and what do you mean by may be changing?","Michael Bilerman","Well, I don't know, I think there's a lot of uncertainty out in the global marketplace and you don't want to be in a situation, where you can't get to that NAV in the event that we have a softer economic environment or there's some other external event that occurs.","Steven Roth","Well, I think that would be the opposite of what you just said. If you're hinting that we may have a recession and the stock market may go down, that would be the time that we would want to avoid buying stock at this price, you think it's going to go lower, I don't know. I mean, I'm not...","Michael Bilerman","Well, I don't think stock - I'm not saying stock buyback, I can see that your view on that, that may not be the route to go, I'm thinking more broadly strategic in terms of liquefying additional assets, may be doing additional spin or split offs, doing some other may be type of sales transactions to narrow the gap between what you believe is $97 and the stock that's in the $70s?","Steven Roth","My answer to that is yes. I mean, we appreciate your advice, believe me, that's something that we focus on every minute of every day. And I've been cautioned by some of my friends out there not to speculate, not even to hint that what we might do, just shut up and do it and that's what we're going to do.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. And I look forward to seeing what comes out. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Steven Roth","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Okay. And the last question in the queue comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Stephen Sakwa","Thanks. Just a follow-up. David, you had kind of touched on this, just in terms of like the TI leasing commissions, they're running a little over 12% in New York. I'm just curious, how you sort of see that number trending over the next year or so? I mean, if rents are up, you see CapEx and TI leasing commissions kind of being flat so that number can go down or do you see that 12% holding steady?","David Greenbaum","Leasing commissions realistically are a function of a percentage of the rent. So leasing commissions realistically are going to track directly as it relates to rent. So unless I'm missing something, I want my leasing commissions to be generally as high as they can be because it's going to reflect a significant rent growth. So I think the only variable relates to TI allowance and as I said, I think those numbers have plateaued.","Stephen Sakwa","Okay, thanks.","Operator","We have no further questions in the queue at this time, so I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Steven Roth for any closing remarks.","Steven Roth","Thanks, everybody. I just want to emphasize one thing, which is, in my remarks, I said that our financial plan is to take the very significant billions coming out of 220 Central Park South, which has a zero cost of capital and putting it into our developments, which will be enormously accretive. We're very excited about our future prospects and growth and all of our conversation about 220 has focused only on One Penn and Two Penn and Farley and not all the other assets. So anyway, we're very enthusiastic. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"21956":["Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) Q4 2012 Earnings Call February 27, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Catherine Creswell","Steven Roth - Chairman and Chairman of Executive Committee","Michael D.

My name is Lorraine, and I will be your operator for today's call. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Catherine Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our fourth quarter earnings release and filed our annual report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents, as well as our supplemental financial information package, are available on our website, www.vno.com, under the Investor Relations section.","In these documents and during today\u2019s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Division; and Joseph Macnow, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everybody. Thank you all for joining the call. Earlier this morning, we announced that after 16 great years, our friend and colleague, Mike Fascitelli, has decided that now is the time for him to give up his day-to-day responsibilities, and that he is stepping down as President and CEO of Vornado effective April 15. Mike is family. This was entirely his decision. The Board has asked that I come back for another tour as CEO. Mike and I had been partners in running Vornado for the last 16 years, as such the transition will be seamless. Vornado will continue its business plan of measured growth in its core New York and Washington businesses, simplification and balance sheet fortification. Mike will continue to be a member of our Vornado family. He will remain a member of the Board of Trustees, maintain an office at 888, our headquarters in New York, and be available for advice and counsel. Mike has made an indelible impact on the history of Vornado. He joined Vornado 16 years ago as President, Chief Growth Officer, and my partner. He came from Goldman Sachs where he was partner in charge of the firm's real estate practice. His past 16 years at Vornado had been a period of unprecedented growth and change. During his tenure, Mike led our Vornado teams in 172 separate acquisitions totaling over $17 billion, all of which were fueled by 125 capital market transactions totaling $27 billion, outstanding performance. It's certainly been a great run. Mike is a highly intelligent, capable and caring leader. The friendships and relationships that were forged between me -- between Mike and me, our trustees and all our colleagues are enduring. The Vornado Board and I could not be more appreciative of his efforts and accomplishments these last 16 years. Thank you, Mike. Your turn.","Michael D. Fascitelli","Thank you, Steve. As Steve said, I've decided to step down as President and CEO of Vornado as of April 15. Vornado has been my consuming passion for 16 years. It's a great company, one of the largest and most respected businesses in the United States. I'm extremely fortunate and proud to be part of its storied history and long-term growth. I'm a firm believer in not being afraid to try something new. It's why I left the great job at McKinsey to join Goldman back 1985. It's why I left my friends at Goldman after 12 incredible years there, when Steve lured me to Vornado in 1997 to assist him in the challenge of helping him run a major REIT.","Steve has been a great partner over the last 16 years. I'm enormously grateful for the opportunities he's created and proud of what we've accomplished together. In recent years, we have successfully executed our strategy of growing smartly, focusing our holdings and fortifying our balance sheet, maybe not as fast as a lot of you guys like sometimes, but we really made great progress there.","Simply put, I have concluded that now is the right time for me to take a break before doing something different. I am deeply confident and invested in Vornado's future. I intend to stay on the Board, maintain an office here and be available for advice and counsel after I step down. I've been lucky enough to work with an extraordinary group of people at all levels, no more exemplified by the people that you'll hear after on this call and many of our other colleagues at Vornado, that helped Steve and I build this great company. My thanks to all of them.","I know many of you, if not most of you, on this call. And over the years, we've gotten to know each other. We haven't always agreed, but we certainly have had an open and honest dialogue. I take great pride in the relationships that we have and I have and Joe has in all these years with many of the investors here on the calls. I look forward to you guys continuing to be great supporters of the company. I look forward to seeing you guys in Florida, too, at the conference for many of you. Steve and my countless other friends at Vornado know that I'll do everything I can to support them in the future.","I'd like to turn now to the quarterly earnings and our normally scheduled conference call that we're going to go through today. I'm going to make some opening remarks before David and Mitchell talk about our New York and Washington business and followed by Joe with a financial review. Then we will answer your questions. We'll end at 11:00 a.m.","","Let me begin by commenting on the macro environment. As you know, 2012 was marked by a significant amount of economic uncertainty, which limited the pace of growth of commercial real estate fundamentals. 2013 is starting off much the same way as real progress is yet to be made in developing a plan to reduce the present deficit and resolve the nation's debt. Sequestration and all of its unknowns loom large. As a result, many businesses are restraining from making significant long-term economic commitments, limiting job creation and business expansion until a clearer picture of economic policy emerges. Nonetheless, demand for high-quality real estate assets remains intact, particularly in New York City and Washington, D.C., as investors bid assets up, while continue to seek stable and less volatile returns. Real estate debt markets have also improved greatly over the course of the last year, and especially for high quality properties and high quality sponsors, including corporate REITs. These factors and low interest rates will enable the recovery to continue in 2013.","Now let me turn specifically to Vornado. I am very pleased with our fourth quarter comparable FFO which was $0.19 per share or 18.4% better than last year's fourth quarter. Our all-in results include a variety of noncomparable items, which include gains from the sale of noncore assets and noncash impairment losses on other noncore assets as a result of reducing the estimated holding period for these assets as we ready them for disposal.","We were very active in the fourth quarter as we were in the first 3 quarters of the year. On dispositions, most recently, we announced the sale of The Plant in San Jose and our 26.2% interest in LNR, both of which are expected to close in the second quarter. The Plant, a power strip shopping center standing over 500,000 square feet, will be sold for $203 million, resulting in net proceeds of $93 million and a net gain of $33 million. The sale of LNR will result in net proceeds of $241 million. LNR provides a 40-plus percent annual yield of our 2.5-year holding period, even taking into account the write-down of loans to LNR prior to recapitalization in July 2010. The investment provides a 12% annual yield over the 8-year holding period.","We also completed the sale of Green Acres Mall in January for $500 million. In November, Alexander's completed the sale of Kings Plaza Mall for $751 million, and we completed the sale of Reston Executive for $126 million. We expect to complete the sale of the Market Street, Philadelphia retail property for $60 million in the second quarter.","On acquisitions. In the fourth quarter, we completed the previously announced acquisition of the 666 Fifth Avenue retail condominium for $707 million, expanding our best-in-class Manhattan street portfolio to 2.2 million square feet. We just closed a 3.6% 10-year interest-only $390 million financing on this property. We acquired a 58.75% interest in Independence Plaza, a 3-building, 1,328-unit residential complex in Tribeca, which spans 2 full city blocks and contains 54,000 square feet of retail space and 550 parking spaces. We laid the groundwork for this transaction in June 2011 when we acquired for $0.30 on the dollar, a 51% interest on the subordinated debt of the property. At that time, the property was in the midst of tenant litigation, had a value of approximately $440 million and was encumbered by a $381 million first mortgage and $180 million of subordinated debt. We also negotiated at that time for a warrant for 25% of the equity for a nominal amount. Since then a litigation has been substantially settled, all in our favor, and the assets improved dramatically as rent-controlled apartments have rolled to market. Our year-end acquisition of the equity, values the property at $845 million. This transaction resulted in a $105 million gain to us. Our total investment is $205 million, which will be reduced significantly after the existing $334 million mortgage is refinanced. We are in the market right now to do this.","We are managing the retail space and our partner, Stellar Management, is managing the residential space at the property.","Vornado Capital Markets acquired 800 Corporate Pointe in Culver City, L.A. for $95.7 million in November. This office property consists of 240,000 square feet -- 243,000 square feet and accompanies a 6-level parking garage, and represents an opportunity for us to raise occupancy from its current 44% level, a great value-added deal.","Now let me comment on the full year of 2012. We did a lot and I'm quite happy with our accomplishments in spite of a difficult leasing environment. Here are some key takeaways: comparable FFO per share was up 5.5% over 2011. This is despite a $54.9 million reduction in Washington resulting from BRAC. We leased over 2.1 million square feet in New York and over 2.1 million square feet coincidentally in D.C. Over 6.6 million square feet of company-wide leasing was done with a positive mark-to-market of 4.5% cash and a 9.1% GAAP. That's a lot of leasing. Each of our businesses had a positive mark-to-market. At our Chicago Merchandise Mart building, we added Motorola Mobility-Google for 570,000 square feet.","Steve as Chairman late of last April, we had been on the simplification mode, achieving over $2.75 billion in asset sales and 26 transactions with an aggregate net gain to Vornado of $718 million, including the sale of Kings Plaza Mall for $751 million, the Green Acres Mall for $500 million and LNR proceeds for $241 million.","We closed the sale of Kings Plaza, generating $623 million taxable gain that was distributed to Alexander's shareholders as a special $122 per share long-term capital gain dividend. Vornado paid out its $202 million share of the dividend to its shareholders in December as a special $1 per share long-term capital gain dividend. We added $1.25 billion of high-quality core assets, including the 666 Fifth Avenue retail condominium I mentioned earlier, the 58.7% interest in Independence Plaza which I discussed, and the Marriott Marquis Times Square hotel retail and signage redevelopment.","In addition, Vornado Capital Fund has acquired over $200 million of office and retail assets. We completed over $2 million -- $2 billion of mortgage refinancing in 2012 at a weighted average rate of 3.23% for an average term of 8 years. We generated enough net proceeds for us to redeem the $500 million in exchanges senior debentures, which had a GAAP cost of 5.32%. We issued a 5.4% Series L and 5.7% Series K perpetual prepared shares totaling 600 million and redeemed 517 million of preferred shares in units, which had a weighted average rate of 6.82% at a $9 million discount resulting in an annual savings of $6.6 million. These are the lowest rates we've ever achieved on our preferreds.","We and SL Green commenced the renovation of 280 Park Avenue and the rehab -- and we, the rehab of the 1.4 million square foot Springfield regional mall, both of which are expected to be completed in 2014. We have completed the demolition down to the second level at 220 Central Park South. We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities in New York, including Hotel Pennsylvania, and in Washington, including 1900 Crystal Drive, Rosslyn and Pentagon City.","On sustainability. Our Washington business received national recognition as we certified 30 buildings, a total of over 2 -- totaling over 9 million square feet, which doubled the number of green buildings in our entire portfolio. This makes Vornado the largest rented and commercial real estate owner of LEED-certified buildings nationally. So it's quite an active quarter and quite an active year.","Now I will turn it over to David to discuss the New York City business.","David R. Greenbaum","Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. Before I turn to the results for the quarter, I want to spend a couple of minutes recapping the overall market\u2019s performance in 2012 and what we're expecting for 2013. I'm sure everyone on this call reads the various market reports produced by the brokerage community. These reports generally describe the market as stable, stuck in neutral with flat absorption and modestly positive asking rents. Rather than rehashing these reports, let me give you my take on some of the larger trends in the marketplace. One of the most important trends we are witnessing is the continuing resurgence of urban centers, whether it's New York, San Francisco or Chicago. Tenants are relocating from the suburbs to the urban cores in order to recruit and retain the best and brightest of the younger generation which values a lifestyle and vibrant energy of the city. The other day, I was talking to one of the brokers that helped us last year move Motorola Mobility from suburban Liberty Hill to the Merchandise Mart in the hot river north section of Chicago. He tells me the vacancy rate in the Chicago suburbs is now over 25%. Here in New York, the job numbers prove that the city is a magnet for talent. Total employment has recovered 139% since the trough and most importantly office-using employment has reached levels we last saw during the peak 2000 period having added 41,000 positions last year. Looking more closely at the office-using jobs, the high paying securities industry shed some 1,000 positions last year and is projected to lose up to 4,000 more this year. The new jobs last year largely were concentrated in the information and professional services sectors. An important subset of these 2 categories is now known as TAMI, technology, advertising, media and information, and is driving the strong demand in the Midtown South market. No surprise, since these types of tenants have more the younger generation of employees who seek that urban lifestyle. Many in the brokerage community now consider our Penn Plaza part of an expanding Midtown South market. In fact, Jones Lang LaSalle just reported that Penn Plaza was the strongest submarket in Manhattan, with year-over-year asking rents driving over 9-plus percent and with less than a 6% class A vacancy rate. An analysis of our Penn Plaza portfolio shows that we have 45 TAMI tenants, including some household names: Cisco, Information Builders, Lever 3, EMC, Hewlett Packard, Avaya, just to name a few. And the TAMI tenants are expanding within our buildings. In the fourth quarter, we completed a 95,000 square-foot expansion at 100 West 33rd Street with the Interpublic Group, an advertising agency, for their Draftfcb division. This took Draft's occupancy in the building to over 500,000 square feet. We also completed an important expansion deal with Level 3 which doubled its space at One Penn Plaza.","There's been a lot of talk within the industry about large financial institutions shrinking their footprint. While this is true for the big banks, we are seeing hiring and expansions by the boutique banks and brokerages. For example, you probably have read about the recent Jefferies & Company expansion. Within our own portfolio last year, both Guggenheim at 330 Madison and Fidelity at 350 Park expanded. We're also seeing growth within the fashion retailing sector, including J. Crew expanding in the fourth quarter by 80,000 square feet to 375,000 square feet at our 770 Broadway. While urbanization and the growth in the non-financial sectors in New York are positive trends, I do want to temper my remarks to some of the other major trends we are witnessing in the market. As I said on our last call, renewals made up the bulk of the large transactions in the market last year enabling tenants to avoid the capital expenditures involved in a move. Tenants that did invest in relocating demonstrated further cost consciousness consolidating, one, multiple offices into a single location and seeking out less expensive space. Tenants are also becoming much more efficient in utilizing space with a continuing shift to a much higher density per person with open office layouts.","Finally, companies have been providing flexibility to employees to \"telecommute,\" by working remotely from home, enabling tenants to reduce their space requirements. Interesting that we're now beginning to see some pushback to these trends. Just yesterday, Yahoo! announced it is reversing its work-at-home policy and requiring its employees to work at its offices to foster a more collaborative and innovative culture.","Now looking at 2013, the general thinking in the brokerage community is that the first half of this year is going to be flat through the continued uncertainty of the debt limit and sequestration with a pickup in growth in the market for the latter half of the year, continuing on an accelerated basis into 2014. We agree with this view.","Let me now turn to Vornado's performance in the fourth quarter and for the year where we continue to do what we do best: lease, lease, lease. In Q4, we signed 36 leases for a total of 457,000 square feet of office space. And our occupancy rate ticked up to 95.9%. The largest deals this quarter were the 95,000 square-foot expansion with IPG at 100 West 33rd and a 80,000 square foot expansion by J.Crew at 770 Broadway that I mentioned earlier. Our average starting rent for the quarter was $53.98 per square foot with a positive mark-to-market of 3.4% cash and 5.8% GAAP.","For the year, we finished with 2 million square feet of total office leasing with a positive mark-to-market of 4.6% cash and 4.9% GAAP. Our office expirations for 2013 are quite modest with only 650,000 square feet expiring this year.","You likely have read some news reports about a couple of our tenants at 1290 Avenue of the Americas. Let me spend a minute updating you on this building starting with AXA, which recently announced it is shrinking its footprint in New York. In 2007, just after we acquired the building, we completed a total restructuring of the AXA lease, reducing AXA's occupancy by half from over 800,000 square feet to 400,000 square feet. At the same time, we nearly doubled AXA's rent from $45 to $88 per square foot, with the increase in cash rent becoming effective July 1, 2012. While AXA has now put most of its space on the sublease market, we have great credit with AXA on the lease through 2023.","The other news in the building is that Microsoft will be vacating its 175,000 square feet by February 2014. We have good activity on this space with a lease out for 100,000 square feet with an important financial institution and are also actively talking to another tenant for 50,000 square feet. With the construction barricade now removed on Sixth Avenue, people are starting to really appreciate the great scale and quality of our lobby renovation. The image of this building is really transforming and I invite you to visit the building to see how impressive it really is.","On the last call, I also briefly discussed the strength of the Penn Plaza market. This is a very important part of our business with over $9 million square feet of office, retail and hotel space. For the year, we leased 830,000 square feet in Penn Plaza, had average starting rents over $52 per square foot. At One Penn, average starting rents were approximately $60 a foot. As you are aware, the Penn Plaza district is anchored by Penn Station, the busiest transportation hub in North America with 600,000 daily commuters. This proximity to transportation is a critically important consideration for tenants and one of the reasons why our Penn Plaza portfolio is consistently full. Looking back at the last 10 years, our Penn Plaza occupancy has averaged above 96%.","Two days ago, on Monday, we completed an important 646,000 square foot lease extension with Macy's at 11 Penn Plaza. Macy's has grown dramatically in 11 Penn, first occupying 100,000 square feet in 2000, adding 250,000 square feet just 3 years later to now occupying 650,000 square feet. With this renewal, Macy's has solidified its commitment to 11 Penn for another 20 years through 2035. The old Macy's lease had a staggered lease expiration with about 45% of its space expiring 2015 and the balance expiring in 2020. The terms of the new Macy's lease were strong, with blended starting rents of approximately $55 per square foot, a positive GAAP mark-to-market of 17.8% and positive cash mark-to-market of 1.2%. The Tenant Improvement Allowance was also quite modest at $42.50 per square foot, less than $2.50 per square foot per annum over the 17-year blended extension term.","The Penn Plaza district anchored by the Macy's store at Herald Square is the largest department store in its size and volume in the world, is also anchored as well by Madison Square Garden, which this summer will be completing its billion-dollar transformation. MSG was spun out of Cablevision in 2009 and Rainbow Media, AMC Networks was spun out in 2011. Similar to Macy's, these companies have grown substantially within our portfolio. Today, Cablevision, MSG and AMC Networks in the aggregate occupy over 650,000 square feet in 2 and 11 Penn Plaza.","Let me spend a moment now on 7 West 34th Street. As previously announced, this building is transitioning from the Merchandise Mart division into the New York division. We will be converting the first 300,000 square feet from showroom to office use in 2014 January. This building was originally a department store so it has great ceiling heights, and we will be repositioning this building to appeal to technology and media tenants in the Midtown South market. We are also working on the design and engineering efforts to reposition 330 West 34th Street, where the primary tenant, the City of New York, vacates the majority of its space later this year.","Let me turn now for a moment to Manhattan street retail. In the fourth quarter, in addition to 666 Fifth Avenue retail, we also completed the acquisition of a leasehold interest in 608 Fifth Avenue. This landmark property on the corner of 49th Street right at Rockefeller Center has 70 feet of retail frontage on 5th Avenue. This is a great spot right at the unofficial border between upper Fifth Avenue, where asking rents have now exceeded $2,700 per square foot and the lower Fifth Avenue retail, where rents have increased some 50% in the last year to over $1,000 per square foot. We have completed a deal to recapture the retail space and are combining it with other spaces in the ground, lower level and the second floor to create a 30,000-plus square foot retail box which we are now marketing. On our last call, I spoke about the Microsoft pop-up store at our 1540 Broadway property in Times Square. We just completed a new lease with Sunglass Hut for the majority of this space at a net rent of $2,025 per square foot, a record in this submarket. We also signed a separate lease with Sunglass Hut, for the highly visible corner spectacular sign above the store.","In summary, for the entire year New York division, a total of 27 million square feet, we had a good quarter with positive same-store of 4% cash and 0.2% GAAP. For the year, we had positive same-store of 2% cash and 2% GAAP.","Let me now turn it back over to Mike.","Michael D. Fascitelli","Thanks, David. Let's turn to Mitchell now to discuss our Washington business.","Mitchell N. Schear","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. I will also start with an overview of the Washington market and then talk about our business more specifically. While the near-term story is sluggish, we believe in Washington for the long term. The near-term sluggishness in Washington is a result of the uncertainty surrounding the budget crisis, which has been stifling for many areas around the country. Local economists, businesses and jurisdictions are spending a lot of time measuring the impact and potential impact of government cuts on the Washington market. While there is endless speculation on the effects of a possible sequestration, the fact is that spending cuts have already happened and will likely continue to happen. Since 1980, government spending in Washington has increased every single year until 2011. In the past 2 years, federal government spending in D.C. dropped by $7 billion, down a total of 8% reflective of cuts that have already happened. Notwithstanding the decline in government spending, the Washington economy still grew and added 28,000 new private sector jobs in 2012. This is well above the 10-year average. While the federal government sorts out its issues, the private sector will help make up the gap resulting from the decline in federal spending.","We believe Washington will continue to grow and will continue to be one of the top markets in the country. In fact, Washington is projected by McKinsey Global Institute to be one of the top 5 growth markets in the U.S. between now and 2025. So where is the growth coming from? Much of it will be from the private sector. Recently, Forbes ranked the Washington area as the second in the U.S. in technology job growth, ahead of Silicon Valley. Washington has the second-highest growth rate in the nation in high tech and science technology, engineering and mathematics-related jobs also known as STEM jobs. David may have TAMI in New York but we have STEM in Washington. These types of jobs are driving growth and attracting bright and talented workers.","In addition, corporate relocations and expansions continue to ramp up. Northrop Grumman, Bechtel and Siemens have all recently relocated their headquarters to Washington. In our own portfolio, just last week, DRS relocated their national headquarters to 2345 Crystal Drive, taking 93,000 square feet. In fact, 4 out of 6 of our largest leases in 2012 reflected an expansion of private-sector tenants, including corporate executive boards, United Nations Foundation and the law firm Cooley in addition to DRS. Over the next 5 years, 240,000 new jobs are expected to be added mostly in the private sector areas of professional and business services. This should create real demand for office space. With 82% of our portfolio in Washington D.C. and Arlington, we are well positioned for the trend David mentioned, where most of the pronounced growth is happening in closed-in urban areas where young talented workers want to be.","Not to say there won't be difficult times in Washington. 2012 was a tough year in particular as Washington reached the peak of BRAC-related vacancy. The leasing activity was brisk. In fact, on par with the 15-year average of 32 million square feet annually, Washington had a negative net absorption of 2.9 million square feet for the year. Throughout the year, we found that rents held steady although concessions have increased. We expect 2013 to be a year in transition. With a budget resolution, growing confidence, private sector employment growth and limited new supply over the next several years, we expect the Washington market to gain real traction beginning in 2014. Our view is that Washington's future is compelling. The workforce is the most highly educated in the country. The housing market is strong. At 5.3%, Washington has the lowest unemployment among major metro areas. The federal government is here to stay. Washington is a forever market.","Now turning specifically to our Washington portfolio. Leasing velocity has been strong. We signed a total of 201 deals aggregating over 2.1 million square feet for the year at an average rent of $40.55 per square foot, generating a positive mark-to-market 3.4% GAAP and 0.4% cash. Government activity accounted for 31.5% of the leases and private sector leases accounted for the remaining 68.5%. Specifically in Crystal City, for the year it was 982,000 square feet at an average rent of $40.47 per square foot with a positive mark-to-market of 3.7% GAAP and 1.6% cash, not bad in such tough market where flat rents would be good.","We continue to enjoy good activity and consistently execute more than our fair share of deals at good rents. During 2012, we signed 6 new over 50,000 square foot leases. In fact, 4 are over 75,000 square feet as compared to just 1 new lease over 25,000 square feet in all of 2011. In the fourth quarter, we leased 482,000 square feet in 50 transactions at an average initial rent of $41.46 per square foot with a mark-to-market decrease of 2.4% and 2.6% cash. Of those fourth quarter leases, government activity accounted for 20% and private sector leases accounted for the remaining 80%. Our occupancy was 84.1% at year end, close to the bottom. Our 2013 lease expirations will be at a historic low of 839,000 square feet. As a point of reference, our scheduled expirations over the past 4 years have aggregated 2.2 million square feet per year. For the entire Washington, D.C. segment same-store EBITDA for the quarter was down 14.3% on a GAAP basis and 14.9% on a cash basis, almost entirely due to BRAC. By way of an update on BRAC, almost all the Department of Defense relocations from our portfolio have taken place and we have resolved approximately 900,000 square feet of the 2.4 million square feet of DoD lease expirations. Releasing the remainder of the BRAC space is a function of time and we will emerge stronger when complete.","Our 2012 EBITDA decline of $54.9 million was less than the low end of our original projection of $55 million to $65 million. We estimate that 2013 EBITDA will be between $5 million and $15 million lower than 2012. We had expected 2012 to be the trough of the cycle, but now expect it will be 2013. Growth in EBITDA will resume in 2014 from our releasing. Our residential portfolio, which consist of 2,414 units in Arlington and D.C. and representing about 12% of our EBITDA today had a same-store EBITDA increase of 6.6% for the quarter and is 97.9% occupied.","We continue to attract great companies to our portfolio. We signed a lease with Facebook who will relocate their Washington headquarters to our Warner building. Also at the Warner, we welcome the law firm Cooley as they open their new 88,000 square foot office and we expanded our relationship with AOL when we signed a new lease at 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue for their Washington, D.C. Office. As you may remember, AOL has their headquarters location in 225,000 square feet at our 770 Broadway in New York. We invite you to visit our new offices the next time you're in D.C. More than a great place to work, we are touring prospective tenants to our offices as a model of how next-generation space can be accommodated in existing Crystal City buildings. Thank you very much, and I turn it back over to Mike.","Michael D. Fascitelli","Thanks, Mitchell. Let me now touch on our retail strips and mall business. The strip shopping center which are concentrated in affluent markets within a density populated, high barrier-to-entry tri-state area had been resilient even in this difficult leasing environment. Occupancy was 93.6% at year end, unchanged from the third quarter, with 82% for spaces under 10,000 square feet and 95% for spaces over 10,000 square feet. We leased 322,000 square feet in the quarter and the positive mark-to-markets were up 6.2% cash and 8.7% GAAP. We leased 1.3 million square feet for the year, and the positive mark-to-markets were 9.6% cash and 20.5% GAAP, including leases with quality tenants such as Costco, TJ Maxx, Home Goods and L.A. Fitness.","Occupancy in our 5 operating regional malls were 92.7%, up 10 basis points over the prior quarter. We leased 75,000 square feet in the quarter, including a 428,000 square foot deal with Forever 21 at Monmouth's Mall. Positive mark-to-markets were 2.3% cash and 10.4% GAAP. We leased 146,000 square feet for the year and the positive mark-to-markets were at 6.7% cash and 13% GAAP. We continue to be especially pleased with the performance of the Bergen Town Center, which posted another strong year of sales growth. We continue to see strong demand for any space that becomes available at the Bergen Town Center.","I mentioned earlier in my opening remarks the Springfield Mall in Virginia is in the midst of a total transformation that will make it the dominant fashion offering for an affluent and underserved trade area in the south side of the D.C. Metro area. The new Springfield Town Center will include existing anchors, J.C. Penney, Macy's and Target, as well as a new cinema, health club and duly anchoring offices, along with 45,000 square feet of restaurants, a new food court and 450,000 square feet of mall shops. The construction leasings are on schedule for summer 2014 opening, and we will be announcing additional lead tenants later this year.","As it relates to the mart business, we have substantially completed a sell-down, a 3.5 million square foot Merchandise Mart building in Chicago remains, which beginning in 2013, which will be included in the Other segment instead of it being a separate segment. Year-over-year EBITDA growth for the continuing business was a positive 4.5% GAAP and 0.7% cash.","In summary, our management team has made great progress in improving Vornado's portfolio of high-quality office and retail assets, and is committed to continuing to make Vornado a simpler company while staying focused on generating the highest total return for our shareholders. We thank our shareholders and other stakeholders for their continued support.","Now I will turn it over to Joe for the financial review.","Joseph Macnow","Thanks, Mike. Yesterday, we reported comparable funds from operations of $1.22 per share versus $1.03 for the prior year's fourth quarter, a $0.19 or 18.4% increase. Total FFO was $0.30 per share versus $1.46 for the prior year's fourth quarter. First call was at $1.19 per share, as some of the analysts factor in noncomparable items into their estimates and others do not.","Turning to results for the full year. We reported comparable FFO of $5.17 per share versus $4.90 per share in 2011, a $0.27 or 5.5% increase. Importantly, this increase is after the $54.9 million reduction in Washington's EBITDA that Mitchell talked about resulting from BRAC. Total FFO was $4.39 per share versus $6.42 per share in 2011, the details of the difference between those 2 numbers can be found in the 10-K in the MD&A overview on Pages 70 and 71 or in our press release.","Definitionally, gains and losses on the sale of real estate are not part of FFO. That's Nary's [ph] definition. Our fourth quarter included net income from such gains of $282 million, primarily from the sale of Kings Plaza, Reston and a portion of the $105 million gain that Mike talked about in Independence Plaza, representing the mark-to-market on the value of the appreciation and the value of the asset. These gains were partially offset by noncash impairment losses aggregating $118 million, primarily on Broadway Mall as we anticipate disposing of additional noncore assets. In the fourth quarter, consistent with our conservative nature, we deemed a diminution in the market value the 18.6 million shares of J.C. Penney we own as \"other than temporary\" the GAAP term for when you take it through the income statement. And therefore we recorded a $224.9 million noncash, noncomparable charge, as well as the regular $22.5 million P&L item coming from the mark-to-market on the derivative which is 4.8 million shares. We also recorded a $40 million noncash write-down on our investment in Toys\u201cR\u201dUs. Based on, among other factors, the continued compression of earnings multiples of comparable retailers. After this write-down, our December 31, 2012, GAAP-carrying amount with Toys is $478 million. That's compares to our economic cost basis of $396 million.","In the first quarter of 2013, we will entirely offset the income we record from Toys' holiday fourth quarter, remember we're on a one quarter lag with Toys' with a noncash write-down so that our GAAP-carrying amount does not increase as of March 31. For the remainder of the year, Toys has historically had losses in the second, third and fourth quarter of their year -- second, third and fourth quarter of our year; first, second and third quarter of their year. We'll recognize those losses and that will have the effect of reducing the GAAP-carrying amount much closer to our economic cost.","Beginning in 2013, we will present Toys as part of noncomparable FFO for both current and prior periods. Let me spend one second on LNR. Under the equity method of accounting, the undistributed income we record over the life of this investment has built up the carrying amount to the approximate $241 million of net proceeds Mike said we'll receive from the sale of this asset when it closes in the second quarter. Accordingly, there will probably be a very small gain recognition when the sale closes. We will cease income recognition on LNR as of January 1, 2013, and we're going to treat LNR's FFO as noncomparable for all periods presented including 2012's quarterly FFO which amounted to $13.5 million, $9.7 million, $16.8 million and $27.2 million for the first, second, third & fourth quarters, respectively.","Our -- on capital market transactions in November, we completed the refinancing of 1290 Avenue of the Americas and a single asset CMBS for a $950 million, about $500 a foot, 3.3% interest only for 10 years which replaced the existing 6.82%, $409 million mortgage. We also completed a refinancing of 4 Union Square South for $120 million, retaining net proceeds of $45 million. This 7 year loan bears interest of LIBOR plus 2.15%, 110 basis points lower than the old loan and begins to amortize after 3 years using a 30-year schedule.","Due to tax considerations of certain significant transactions close to year end, our revolving credit facilities had a higher-than-usual outstanding balance of $1.17 billion at December 31, 2012. We expect the revolver's outstanding balance at the end of the first quarter to be reduced close to 0 and in fact, it's about $350 million today. At December 31, 2012, we had over $2.4 billion in liquidity, our consolidated debt to enterprise value was 38.6% and our consolidated debt to EBITDA was 7.2x, that's higher than normal reflecting the unusual balance in the revolver. As we pay down the revolver in the first quarter, the consolidated debt to EBITDA will return to a more normal 6x.","In the fourth quarter, we raised our quarterly common dividend to $0.73 a share, a new annual run rate of $2.92 per share or 5.8% more than the previous $2.76 run rate. I reiterate that Mitchell mentioned earlier Washington segment 2013 EBITDA is expected to be between $5 million and $15 million lower than 2012's EBITDA. FFO might be less of a diminution than that. Earlier this month, we received $124 million in full settlement of our rent claim against Stop & Shop which will result in $60 million of cash income in the first quarter of 2013. This ends 10 years of litigation and we are, of course, very satisfied with the outcome. One last administrative note. We have recently passed -- posted on our website the tentative dates and times for each of our 2013 quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mike.","Michael D. Fascitelli","I just want to apologize for the lengthy comments but this is actually a very -- full report about the quarter and the year, and recognizing that's taking up quite a bit of the -- our allotted time. And in the other news disseminated on the call, we are happy to let this go as long as you'd like to go beyond that hour and answer any questions. So I just want to make that comment given the time it's taken to get through these materials that we're happy to extend the call beyond the hour. So with that, we'll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Josh Attie from Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Michael Bilerman. Mike, Steve, I certainly appreciate all the comments, and Mike you will be extremely missed. But that's nothing against Steve on your second tour of duty in the CEO slot. But obviously we do have a lot of respect for Mike. I wanted sort of get a better understanding of what exactly drove the decision and sort of why now you feel is the right time? The company has obviously made a lot progress in the simplification over the last year and I think you would both agree that there are still more to go and we're still sort of early in that process. And so I'm just curious in terms of: a, sort of what exactly drove and why now, but also has there been any sort of disagreement at all on the path forward from here in terms of how to execute and what to execute on?","Steven Roth","Thanks. I'll start off by saying I agree completely with your comments about Mike's talent and that he will be missed. It was entirely Mike's decision. And the balance of the question, I'll let Mike handle a little bit. We'll interchange as we answer your question, Michael.","Michael D. Fascitelli","Michael, thanks again. I -- there's never a great time to do this, but we thought it was a good time. We really embarked on a very rigorous program and it's not over yet, as you point out but it's well on its way. This was the end of the year, it was a good time as we wrapped up the year and that to go forward with the team we have in place, everything should be pretty seamless. So my departure I think won't affect that at all. There's absolutely no disagreement between Steve and I, or the other members of the Board on this strategy or the timing of that. I think you investors, tend to want things to happen at a quicker pace but sometimes, we've done what the market would allow, but I think the pace is very measured and that pace of -- measure pace will continue.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just in terms of a follow-up, Steve, corporate governance obviously is a hot topic and has been a hot topic with the company over the years in terms of proposals, a, from the staggered board but, b, obviously you had split the Chairman and CEO roles a number of years ago which did satisfy some of those issues. And so I'm just curious from that level with you stepping into the CEO role, how do you sort of move forward from a corporate governance perspective? And sort of how do you and the Board think about this tour of duty going forward?","Steven Roth","Well, our governance record is, to some people, not the best in the world. I can tell you that we grapple. Our board is extremely focused on governance, extremely focused on doing the right thing and extremely focused on creating shareholder value. There's an enormous amount of shareholders in our board room when we meet each time. And -- but we recognize that our position on some of the governance issues have been less than what some of you all would like. To be honest with you, Michael, I don't anticipate that changing. With respect to -- although, it's practically the season, that's -- and that's going to come out shortly. With respect to the Chairman and CEO role, 4 years ago when Mike succeeded me as CEO, we sort of got an uptick in that grade. We're about to go down to a downtick in that grade, but the answer is we debated this long and hard. By the way, this kind of -- we've gotten some comments this morning that Mike's decision seems very abrupt and very unexpected. We apologize very much for that, for it seeming like that. But you can be assured, that's the external take on it because we're a public company, this is an important piece of news. And obviously, we couldn't be gambing [ph] about it in the marketplace while we were thinking through these arrangements. Internally, certainly, at the Board level, this is something that has been considered extensively for not a long time but certainly not a short time. The Board decided that the right thing was for me to do another tour of duty and there you have it. With respect to me, I'm a Vornado lifer and so that's what it is. I mean, I've been the CEO before and -- but I would leave you with one thought. I mean, I'm not going to do this forever. I'm not saying that I'm going to do it shortly, but I'm saying I'm not going to do it forever. With respect to one other point. Mike and I, really when I -- I think one of the material says, I lured or recruited Mike from Goldman Sachs 16 years ago, which is true. When he joined, he joined as a full partner in every regard in terms of how we treated each other and decision-making, et cetera. And we've been sort of full partners and interchangeable for these 16 years. The business plan that we have followed for this 16 years is something that we jointly agreed upon and the business plan that we will continue which is basically simplification, fortifying our balance sheet and acquiring selectively and carefully in our 2 wonderful markets, New York and Washington, is what we have been pursuing for some years now and we will pursue in the future. I hope that answers your question, Michael.","Operator","And our next question comes from George Auerbach from ISI Group.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Mike, I think we all echo Michael's comments. Steve, I guess the company was very focused in 2012 on asset sales. And as you sort of return to the CEO role, any change to the strategy on asset sales going forward, either accelerating the pace of stabilized asset sales as you think about Toys\u201cR\u201dUs or J.C. Penney? And I guess also, what should we expect in terms of 2013 sales, what's sort of pipeline?","Steven Roth","The asset sales program which was started, not in 2012, but a few years before, which accelerated in 2012, will be based on market conditions and our ability to get good prices will continue. It will continue in a measured way, we have a list of, we have a for-sale list, a to-do list and I can tell you that -- let's talk about how we come up with the list. That list basically is -- I mean, the first way -- criteria is assets that we would rather have the cash, than own the asset. Meaning, that we -- either it doesn't fit, it's not strategic, it's not or we don't like its growth prospects or every once in a while we have a few mistakes. I mean, when you have a $30 billion company and when you made $20 billion of acquisitions over the years, not every asset works out perfectly. So that's -- and also, our basis in the asset, tax gains and everything. There's a whole long criteria list but it's mainly assets that we would rather have the cash than have the asset and the growth prospects. So we will execute on those as we are able to in the marketplace, getting prices which we think are right prices. This is a very good time to sell assets. We're aware of that, we will continue aggressively to sell what we don't want to own. With respect to Toys and J.C. Penney, those are more complicated. I mean, it's fairly -- it's very well known, we've been extremely transparent in this. We've written about it in my letter. Mike has said it frequently. Toys was a business that we bought to sell. It was a business that we bought with Bain and KKR of the great LBO firms, and everybody knows what their business model is. And so that is an asset that we or a business that we, together with our partners, aggressively would like to sell. We've been struggling to sell it. The IPO market has deteriorated, notwithstanding the fact that the business has performed actually pretty damn well. So that, the exit of Toys is something based upon market conditions and that may take some time and we have told you all that that's on the for-sale list, but it's a function of when we can execute. J.C. Penney is a newer investment which is struggling right now. J.C. Penney has its earnings call this afternoon, I think after the market closes. I'm a Director of J.C. Penney so I really can't talk very much about it, but J.C. Penney is an investment which is in progress now and I -- really, it's inappropriate for me to talk about what our holding period might be or what our future plans in terms of sale or not sale and the timing. It's just not appropriate in that particular investment. I hope that answered your question, George.","Michael D. Fascitelli","The only thing I would add to the last part of your question, which is we have a robust pipeline of assets activity for future sales in 2013. That is ongoing and each asset's assessed and we have -- at least expect to continuing that program, as you said George, for the rest of 2013. And you'll get the specifics in that more closely from Joe once we go through that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum from UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Mike, I wanted to follow up on a comment you had made at the beginning of the script, which was you thought that now was the right time and, I guess, I think about major decisions I have made in my life, whether they're professional or personal and I think about, okay, is what I'm going doing going to make me happier as a human being? And I guess I'm trying to relate that thought to your change here in so far as was there something occurring at Vornado that wasn't challenging you or making you as happy as you wanted to be?","Michael D. Fascitelli","Well, that's a very philosophical question but I'll attempt to answer, Ross. These are very personal decisions, as you point out. And as I mentioned in Michael's question, there's no perfect time to do this. I have a great admiration for the company. It's part of the fabric of my being. Steve and I and the colleagues in this room, David, Mitchell, Joe, and all the other colleagues that are not in the room that helped build a great company and it's just not -- it's like having a child. So as Steve said, it's been an intense 16 years, too. Not all of it has been perfect, not all of it has been fun but it's certainly been a great, rewarding experience. At some point -- I'm 56 years old, I've been doing it for 16 years, it's -- it just felt like the right time for a change. I -- my objective is I'm not unhappy but I got probably a lot of interests that I like to think about pursuing after I take some time off. I -- this is not an easy job, as you guys know, and part of the difficulties of the job stem from probably dealing with you guys sometimes because it's not that easy. But -- so we really have done our best and we can go down, take in -- and from my standpoint, I just think that the company is in great shape. It's got great assets, it's got great people and I'm going to stay involved with Vornado. I'm going to be on the board. I've got a significant stake in the company, I'm available to help in any way I can and you never leave your child. And from my standpoint, as my continued support, just I want to explore, doing something very different. I'll take some time off, take a break. And I'm not getting any younger, and now is the time to do it.","Steven Roth","Let me add on to that a little bit, if I can. As I've said I think 2 or 3 times on this call so far, this was entirely Mike's decision, okay? Entirely Mike's decision. Mike is family, this was entirely Mike's decision. The second is, he works like an animal and each year at this job, and running a company of this scale, size and complexity is like dog years. I will tell you that personally I think he got the better of the deal. I'm saying, he's leaving, number one. Number two is he has, and I'm proud of this, had an unbelievably rich experience and I have had too being partners for these 16 years. He's created a great deal of wealth which is he hasn't been able to enjoy and I think the decision that he made, while I am unhappy to lose somebody of this -- of his obvious talents, skills and abilities, I think it's an unbelievably courageous decision that there is life after Vornado, there's life after working like a dog for 30-some-odd years and I think that that's an unbelievable, courageous decision. I think if you look at where we are in the business cycle, in terms of the real estate business cycle, I think that's also something. I mean, it's hard to invest money, it's hard to make money, the stocks are in flat line and so it's not as if this is easy. This is a very difficult business, very difficult industry. And I must tell you that I think I admire Mike's courage for making a decision, a personal decision like this. By the way, his kids, they don't want him sitting home.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And Steve, just a quick follow up. Was there any thought process at the Board to look internally or externally for the next CEO of Vornado or was it just a sort of a de facto that you are the guy?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is I don't think it's appropriate to get into confidential board deliberations like that. I can tell you that obviously this was not something that was sudden, that's a fact. Number one, this was not an emergency. Number two is we have candidates internally who are unbelievably talented and who are full well able to run businesses on their own. Number 2 is, there's lots of candidates on the outside but the Board's deliberations were to slot me in for a second tour and I mean, I think that's all I'm going to say about it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Knott from Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Steve, I just wanted to kind of follow on that question in how you think about succession planning. Now you, yourself, said you won't do this forever. Obviously the sales program is important and continuing the job that's at hand but part of succession planning for after tour of duty 2.0 up on your list?    Obviously we are going to focus on succession planning","Steven Roth","Obviously, we're going to focus hard on succession planning. It's not imminent. It's not something that's a crisis, but it's a something that obviously we have to focus on and we will. I am not -- I'm unable to and I'm not going to and it's inappropriate to give anybody a time line on what -- when and how that will happen, okay? We think we have management team -- we don't think, we are confident and certain we have a management team in place that can run this company, as well as it's ever been run and hopefully, we're going to thrive. In terms of putting a timing on succession, it's not something I can do now.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","A couple of easier ones. I'd be interested in sort of a self-assessment on the LNR experiment, did it work out how you thought, any thoughts on that? And then also, what are your thoughts on timing of exiting the mart business or the remaining mart asset?","Steven Roth","I'll tell, Michael, I was more comfortable in the first 3 conference calls where all the questions went to Mike. Okay, let me handle the question. Yes, we're actually delighted with the LNR investment. I think as Joe said if you look at the investment from the beginning of time, which was an 8-year period, which had a write-down and a restructuring, it was a 12% IRR, if I'm not mistaken. Is that the right number?","Unknown Executive","Yes.","Steven Roth","And if you look at it from the infusion of the additional $100-plus million a couple of years ago, it's a 40-odd percent IRR, okay? Having said that, so in terms of the financial performance of the investment, we're fine. The theory as to why -- this was not a dabble, okay? This was not a wayward investment. This was something that we thought was strategically an important investment to advance our business and that was the servicing -- the largest servicing company -- some special service there in the country which has eyes, earn, tentacle and what have you into an enormous portfolio of hundreds of billions of dollars or a hundred-plus billions of dollars of finance, some of which gets into trouble which, of course, is right down our main street. And so we were happy with the investment. The reason the investment was sold is that we had 5 partners. We were a minority partner. And the fund investors wanted to sell and we decided, I think, rightly that if we would prefer to either own it all or sell along with our other partners. And we declined to own it all and so, therefore, we're selling. What I'm saying basically, the financial side of the investment, I think, worked out fine. The raise on debt from making the investment strategically, I think, also worked out fine and it was just the ownership structure where we just decided we didn't want to be -- own this thing at $1 billion. So I think -- I mean, there you have that. What was the second half of your question, by the way, Michael?","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just timing on the mart.","Steven Roth","Well, the mart is basically done. And so Mike and the team did a great job over the last 1.5 years of selling the business in pieces. We try to sell it 3 or 4 or 5 years ago multiple times as an entity. We were unable to do -- to get an execution of that. And so we decided that the business -- our business plan was to exit the business and we did so by selling it off in pieces. That execution, the cornerstone of which was -- the largest part of which was the sale of the 350 West -- what's the address 350?","Unknown Executive","West Bart.","Steven Roth","West Bard building to Shorenstein [ph] was the largest, that was a multi-hundred million dollar transaction. The rest of the assets were basically sold off. What we remain now with is the big 3.5 million square feet Merchandise Mart building in Chicago where we just made the 570,000 square-foot lease with Motorola Mobility-Google, and I'll talk about that in a minute. The trade shows, which operate out of that business, and a small circle of other trade shows, the -- a small investment in New York City, which very small, that we don't have to get into. The 7 West 34th Street building which is an important asset that was originally -- that will go to the -- that would be turned over to the New York office business next year, and I think there's a development project in Cleveland. So basically it's down to the one big large mart building. We are going to hold the Merchandise Mart building in Chicago. We think it is just on the foothills of creating value as it climbs up of the value creation. We think it is in Ground Zero in terms of the tech and office demand for modern, younger office space in the Chicago market, right in the Ground Zero and with Google going in, it is now Ground Zero. And we think as we transform that asset into more of a modern tech office building with his huge 200,000 square foot floors, the values will go up, the cap rate will go down. So for the moment, we're going to hold that business, that building and improve it. We expect there's a lot of value creation there. The mart division as a separate accounting segment will cease to exist in 2013. The mart building will be in the other segment and the mart division has gone away.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Harris from Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","I have a question for Joe. Joe, variable debt as a percentage of total rose to 27%. I did hear your remarks on the credit line being reduced to 0, but even if it goes down to 24%, 25% you're still -- it's a very high level right at the sector. Any view as to where you go with this?","Joseph Macnow","Well, I don't think it's going higher but our floating rate debt has always been proportional, always been used when an asset is in a state of redevelopment or re-tenanting. You are absolutely right, David. It's unusually high because of the $1.1 billion, which as I said today is $350 million outstanding on another revolving credit, but we're comfortable in the 20% plus\/minus floating rate to total debt range.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","You're not unnerved at all by quantitative easing, turnaround quantitative easing and what's happening in some of the treasury market move?","Michael D. Fascitelli","Well, we've taken -- we've looked at the financing. We've done a couple of billion dollars, and many of those, as David talked about what some of the assets were on for 10 years 6666 Avenue -- I mean, Fifth Avenue.","Joseph Macnow","1290.","Michael D. Fascitelli","1290. That alone is close to $1.4 billion of fixed-rate 10-year deals. So we believe these rates on a long-term basis are quite attractive and quite attractive relative to even what we bought 664, we got a better yield than we expected. So we like the long-term market. Some assets aren't warranted, either because of the cash flows, the nature of their redevelopment. They just belong on the floating rate basis. So I think it's proportional, but we are really taking advantage where we can of the long-term interest rate market and the debt markets.","Steven Roth","David, the numbers that you're referring to are aberrant because there is a bubble in short-term line borrowing this year, which hasn't happened before, basically to bridge several transactions which had to be done in late December before financing could be done on them. So basically that's an aberrant and as Joe said to you, that floating rate debt will be paid down to 0 and maybe even lower than 0, which means that -- perhaps more causative cash balance, hopefully, by the end of this quarter, so those numbers are aberrant. Number two is, the yield curve is fairly flat. It's not flat on a percentage basis but it's flat on an absolute basis. So if you can borrow in the low 3s, mid-3s 10-year and the evidence of that is we just did a 3.6% loan on -- for $390 million on 666 retail. We did an enormously important and advantageous loan of $950 million on 1290 Avenue of the Americas which, by the way, is about $500 a foot so it's not nothing. In the low 3s for 10 years, so keep that in your mind. And the short-term debt is if we borrow a variable, it's in the low 2s. So there's only 100 basis points to go out and lock in 10 year money so we're aware of that.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Now the -- Mike's part as CEO isn't only change in CEO that is kind of part of your universe. Jerry Storch is leaving Toys and it kind of leads me to ask the question as to -- is the property element of these stories which we always sort of related to the part and we were both in Toys, as well as J.C. Penney. We understood that the focus really on improving operations and much less on the property dimension. With those investments playing out the way they are, is there a reconsideration of, perhaps, becoming more active on the property side?","Michael D. Fascitelli","In those deals or in general, David?","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Those 2 specific deals.","Michael D. Fascitelli","Well, we still think we have a tremendous amount of real estate value in Toys. And Toys was more based on the real estate underpinnings of the U.S. real estate than Penney's was, and we still think there's an opportunity to harvest the Toys' real estate both on a financial basis and on an operating basis in the U.S. particularly, and so that isn't something that we're very much actively looking at in Toys. Obviously, you look at -- I mean, you see there's a pretty big spread in multiples continuing as you see by a lot of people in the REIT today who are between operating companies, which are trading at 6-plus and property companies which are trading at 12, 15, 20 whatever. So there's still quite an opportunity for financial value-added in the Toys situation.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Can you add any comment as to the replacement of Gerald?","Michael D. Fascitelli","I think Jerry had been also at it for close to 8 years in a rather difficult business and as Steve said, he made quite an improvement to the EBITDA of that company and then it sort of flattened out. And I think in that, in the LBO world, the private equity world, that's a pretty long cycle and I wanted to move on and to do something different. Toys again has quite a good bench of people and in that case, we do have a search going on for a new CEO of Toys.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Any time frame?","Michael D. Fascitelli","As soon as we can. They take their time and we've got to get the right candidates as opposed to pick up a week or 2.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Steve, because I don't normally get a chance to speak to you. So just want to get your take. You guys have worked hard on trying to simplify the company. You obviously have created a huge success in Alexander's which is a really focused pure play. At what point would you say if the markets not recognizing the sum of the parts value of Vornado would you say, \"Hey, it's time to split up into office, retail and create a spinoff of the other bucket where there's more than noise but it's not really driving the EBITDA of the company.\" How long would you think of pursuing this altogether strategy versus saying, \"You know what, if market value is more of stand-alones, let's pursue that.\"","Steven Roth","That is a strategy that we have considered, are considering and will consider. And I want to be very careful here as to not create any speculation but we have no current plans to do that. Although I would tell you that these are strategies that we understand, we have done before and we have looked at extensively. But I don't want to cause that any speculation, okay? The advent of Mike's decision should not also cause any speculation.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then the second question is on 220 Central Park South, just given how condo cycles come and go quickly. Obviously, the market for condos, high-end condos is quite incredible, and it takes time for you -- for any condo project to come to fruition. What are your thoughts on just selling the project, selling the rights, crystalize the value in the market today and let someone else take risk of building out, delivering, et cetera?","Steven Roth","The answer is I think that's a very good question and a timely question. We have and my partner David, David Greenbaum is here, has worked tirelessly for 5 years to get occupancy of that building. We've not taken the old rental apartment house down to the garage where we have an irritant, as I think everybody knows. Well, he maybe an irritant to us but we're an irritant to him because we're in front of him, so I think everybody knows the dynamics of the situation. And I think -- I do want to say anything more about the because that will get all over the newspapers. We are aware of the dynamics and the timing of the market. We're aware of all of the opportunities and potential in an asset. You should know that we believe it's the single best, and I think it's universally believed by the marketplace as the single best condo site in town and that we are hard -- we are focused hard on trying to get resolution and create value.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Josh Attie from Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, it's Michael Bilerman again. Steve, just going back to sort of the cash side of things and I think you'll have -- once you pay down the line and execute on the stuff that you've already announced on, almost $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and so -- and the balance sheet leverage is obviously in a great place from that perspective also. And so I'm curious because now we're sort of having almost a 1-year anniversary on the shareholders' letter in terms of everything being on the table. The stock has been volatile over that time frame, but effectively we're at the same spot. So I'm curious, as now your role as Chairman of the Board and CEO of the company, do you think about using that cash more aggressively to put a share buyback in place and use that if you feel that there's still a disconnect between effective in the value that has been created and all the wonderful things that Vornado still has to come and where the stock trades?","Steven Roth","We are intent as a management team and that, by the way, I would point out to you that I now -- since Mike sits on the Board and I'm management, I now work for Mike, which is something we were all sort of giggling about yesterday. And he is relentless on creating value as is the rest of our board. We're focused on closing the gap between what the shares might be worth and what they're selling for. There are various techniques to do that. Buybacks is something that we have considered if there's -- and I don't want to speculate on it. And we do know how to do a buyback, I would remind you 100 years ago in the beginning of time in the 1980s, we did the largest buyback in the history of the stock exchange, which basically created the modern Vornado. So we're aware of that technique and yet I don't want to speculate but I'm not sure that, that would be my #1 or #2 value creator right now.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess, what are the #1 and #2 value creators?","Steven Roth","We're not going to speculate on that either, but that's a very -- you're very sharp to pick that up, Michael.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess, in terms of roles and responsibilities it, obviously, is a tough job being a CEO of the company and you guys said it's -- and clearly as evidenced by the number of things that Mike has to take care of as a public company CEO, I'm just curious having been partners for so long, how do you replicate within your deep bench, the roles and responsibilities that effectively you and Mike have done over the years amongst others? Or are you going to be working now double duty and working even more like an animal? So I'm just curious how do you sort of go forward?","Steven Roth","Well, I will tell you that this morning we had an all-hands senior management meeting at dawn to talk about all these things and announce some of the things that were announced on the stock market. And one of the things I said was I was going to put a closing time limit on the 45th floor and the 44th floor at 6:00. And my target there was Greenbaum who never gets home before 9:00 or 10:00. The answer is we have the management here to run the business. Hopefully -- I mean, one of my management peeves is that if you can't run the business in -- if you can't do your job within the allotted daylight hours of normal work, then something's wrong. You're overworked or you're not delegating properly or what have you. We have -- I have every confidence that we will figure it out and we will figure it out. Now that's not to say when somebody as talented as Mike falls out of the organization and as I said, we don't -- we're not going to replace him, but things aren't going to be different. Things will be a little different, but they'll be marginally different. And we're going to be -- we have the talent to run the business, be assured of that. Some of the things that Mike does, Joe's going to do. Okay? Some of the other things that Mike does, I'm going to do. Some of the other things that Mike does will be spread around other senior managers of the business and so we have a pretty decent idea of how that's going to happen.","Michael D. Fascitelli","I think -- one comment, I think the management team, this had been a closer one. Well, attended management team. We've been together a lot so people pitch in. So after we had this conversation, David said to me, \"I got a few more things to do now. A few more -- a little bit more work.\" And everyone is going to step up and the people below them are going to step up, and sometimes change is very good for a company. It gets excited and people want to step up and fill those acts and those voids. So I'm fully confident that'll happen. Steve and I overlap a lot, too. Don't we do things that are somewhat overlapping? It will be done by Steve. So I think it's going to be more seamless, Michael, than you might anticipate and there will be some transitions in that, but I feel it'll be a good opportunity for not only the people in this room but the people below them to step up and do more things.","Steven Roth","Michael, continuing on this point. The cornerstone of our businesses is that I think we have in New York and Washington the 2 best operating platforms in the business. Certainly, the best-in-class and that involves running buildings, managing buildings, repositioning buildings, renovating buildings and most important, leasing buildings, okay? There's nobody better there may be few people there that are almost as good as we are, but there's nobody better than we are. Those businesses are run by very talented managers. You know them and those -- that's not affected by what happens in the senior executive suite. In our business, it's generally a dozen major decisions a year that create the value and create the direction of the business, okay? Those decisions have to be done thoughtfully in a measured way and we are aware of what those decisions are and we are full well confident that we're going to make the right decisions. The other activities which is in terms of financing and dealing and dealmaking, the finance -- Mike was very heavily involved as was I as partners almost interchangeable in financing decisions, those are half a dozen or 9 or 8 or 7 a year and the big area is in the area of dealing where we have a very, very active dealer organization in New York and Washington and we're going to be fine. Mike is not going that far. If I need him to come back, he'll -- to do -- to work an all-nighter or to do something, he's going to do it.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Is there any separation agreement? Obviously, it Sounds like it's Mike's decision and he's resigning. There's no separate -- there shouldn't be any separation agreement or some form of continuation in terms of count -- payment for -- I don't know if it's restricted stock or options or anything like that or consulting agreement? What -- how should we think about any financial impact at all going forward?","Steven Roth","There will be no -- no financial. There will be no -- what's the word?","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Severance?","Joseph Macnow","No. There's no accounting charge for Mike's leaving.","Steven Roth","There's no accounting charge for Mike's leaving. There will be an 8-K filed probably I think tomorrow which will have all of the information that you seek, okay?","Operator","And our last question comes from Michael Knott from Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Mike, everyone will wish you well as you move on to the next phase of your professional life. I did want to ask sort of related to Michael's question just now. Is there going to be a noncompete? And then also sort of related to that, how would the board seat dynamic and if Mike wound up being a competitor down the road? Or is that even a potential outcome at all?","Steven Roth","I'll answer and Mike will answer it. There is a noncompete, which is in his employment agreement, which lasts for 1 year. Obviously, we want Mike to stay on the board. He's valuable. He has unbelievable institutional knowledge of our company and general knowledge of business. If he became a competitor of Vornado in the future, which would be after a year from now, and I'll bet you he can comment about that, obviously, he can no longer be a Director.","Michael D. Fascitelli","First of all, thank you, Michael. I don't plan to be a competitor. My interest and my desire is right now completely not in the area. And I -- if I ever got to that situation, I certainly won't be able to be on the Board of Vornado and I think Steve and I and the Board recognize that. So right now it's not something that's on the horizon. If it ever gets to be, we'll deal with it then. But I look forward to being able to take a little perspective and basically help out from a board perspective as opposed to day-to-day running of the company.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last question would be for you, Steve. I know you're committed to the J.C. Penney investment. But just a question, does being on the Board there somewhat compromise your independence, so to speak, to potentially exit that investment if that was deemed to be the best thing to do?","Steven Roth","Yes.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Yes, it does compromise?","Steven Roth","Yes. The answer to your question, Michael, is yes.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Is it the best thing for Vornado, for you to be on the Board there?","Steven Roth","I'm not -- I can't comment on that.","Operator","And we will take the last question from John Guinee from Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","David and Mitchell, you guys have done a remarkable job of holding rents in the mid-50s in New York and plus or minus $40 in D.C. and that price point appears to be one where there's not that much pushback from tenants. Is that sustainable over the long term for the downside? And then what's the upside from those particular price points for product in which you specialize? And then another quick question is regarding Toys, Bain and KKR are both midterm money funds that they've assembled. Lenders have a midterm mentality. What's the timing pressure from a Bain, the KKR and the lenders on Toys?","David R. Greenbaum","John, I can start it. It's David. I think as I said in my remarks, value has been a trend in the office market now for the last 24-plus months and I think your comment which is generally tenants have been looking and the sweet spot effectively has been in the kind of sub $60 space. Actually has benefited us I think in enormously as I said the Penn Plaza area. In fact, in that area, as I've said, we've seen rents actually rise pretty significantly over the last 12, 18 months. In terms of the long-term picture, I remain pretty bullish on New York. I think the challenge that you have right now is the fact the there is a lot of space downtown which realistically could attract some tenants in fact, what I call reverse migration from midtown to downtown at relatively low rents. I still think that our portfolio and the locations that we have right in transportation hubs Penn Plaza and around Grand Central and long-term basis kind of feel very good about rents. And as you look at the general statistics, I don't see new construction that's talked about. I think most of the new construction realistically is in the ground today. Obviously, we've got a building going up in Hudson Yards. But these buildings are all potentially enormous. These are all 2-plus million square foot buildings. It's hard to put these things up and I'm not concerned about \"a lot of space being dumped on the market.\"","Michael D. Fascitelli","Mitchell, do you want to comment on DC?","Mitchell N. Schear","Yes. John, the way I would address it is you're asking if these rents are sustainable. I think if you sort of think about it in a couple of different segments. First off, the rents today have been holding. What we've seen and what I think we'll see in 2013 is concessions will continue to be out there and be at a high level notwithstanding that the rents are relatively flat until we sort of clear all the space out of the market that we've got. There is not a lot of new space in the pipeline. And as we continue to build up demand, I think that we'll see a pickup of rent over time. So I think long-term I think that those rents absolutely should grow and if you just look at some of the new builds down, you're seeing rents in the $55 triple net rent when you gross them up $83 to $85 and those are pretty, pretty strong numbers, notwithstanding the marketplace that we're in. So long term, I think we're in good shape.","Michael D. Fascitelli","Just to briefly comment on Toys that we're ramping up. Obviously, Steve made a comment that [indiscernible] Toys, KKR and Bain and us are on the same page about trying to seek liquidity in the investment. I wouldn't call it pressure in that you have to get out and do something that if I would  say, rash. The company, the Toys' balance sheet is actually quite good. There's quite a bit of cash inventory the balance sheet. You'll see there our numbers shortly. There is actually, all the debt of Toys, there a maturity of at least 3, 4 years and only -- the only -- there's opportunistic things to do with the Toys' from refinancing as opposed to defensively. So I think we're going to seek an exit and seek a measured exit. I think everyone feels kind of responsible to do that but I wouldn't  characterize it as pressure, John, to get out of any price to do something that's not in keeping with a really good execution. So we're working hard on it so that's what I would comment on Toys.","I'd just like to end this, if I could, by saying thank you to all of you guys again for your support. You guys are challenging. You're probing. You have questions. You are constantly probing Steve, Joe, Cathy, et cetera. We know you're doing that you guys are shareholders and investors and we appreciate that faith and confidence. On a personal note, I will not miss these conference calls, I'm going to be honest, but I will miss you guys. And I will hope that I'll be able to keep in touch but I want to thank you again for all your good wishes and support. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.

Good morning, everyone. Our industry leading first quarter, financial results were very strong. In fact, since all of our New York brethren have already reported, I can say definitively that Vornado\u2019s first quarter financial results were by farther the best in town with many of our business metrics outperforming by a wide margin. FFO was adjusted with $0.91 per share as compared to $0.84 per share for the prior year\u2019s first quarter and 8.3% increase.","On a cash basis, FFO was adjusted with $0.89 per share as compared to $0.81 per share for the prior year\u2019s first quarter at even greater 9.9% increase. This quarter's cash basis NOI was 349 million, up 4.5% from the first quarter of 2017. Cash basis same-store NOI increases whereas follows. New York segment up 5.6% with office up 8.1% and retail essentially flat to 0.2%, the mark of 10.0 and 555 California Street up 13.3%.","Our office business continues to perform very well while retail continues to soft. I know that Wall Street is down on New York. We don\u2019t see -- in fact, we see just the office. We are experiencing robust demand from all matter of industries in all of our submarkets. Our tenants are optimistic, aggressive, growing and up keyed about New York. Notwithstanding our superior financial performance, this quarter we still expect the year to be flat gap although nicely positive cash.","We also reaffirm our previous guidance that retail cash NOI will not go below $304 million. We are pleased with the performance of our spin-offs JBG Smith Properties and Urban Edge Properties. These companies will perform better on a standalone basis. We are also pleased with our over $6 billion of recent asset sales, which would likely command a lower price if sold today.","Now turning to the investment sales market. The office investment sales market has picked up smartly although bidding pools are still not the highest quality assets continue to trade at strong pricing level. Investor interest and pricing for asset South and West in Manhattan is particularly strong. Overall, investor demand is fairly well balanced between domestic and foreign capital. There continues to be scanned sales activity in the retail sector due to both a lack of quality product on offer and understandable investor skittishness.","Pricing is clearly up for everything except prime well leased assets. Debt markets for New York assets remain as liquid and strong as we have seen with all markets wide open. Although rates are up, spreads remain tight, keeping all in coupons at attractive levels. We have a highly liquid fortress balance sheet with $4 billion of liquidity, reasonable leverage and well staggered debt maturities.","Now to Dave.","David Greenbaum","Steve, thank you. Good morning everyone. Finally, a warm sunny spring day in New York. Employment trends in New York continue to be very positive. The office sector employment number for 2017 has been revised upward significantly by some 40% by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, adding 8,000 jobs, office sector jobs to a total of 28,000 jobs for the year. But appear to be a very good year now looks even better.","Job growth in the first quarter of 2018 continues to be healthy and the city continues to fire on all cylinders with multiple sectors serving as engines of growth. The quarter's two stunning announcements by J.P. Morgan and Google reflect the continued strength of the two most important engines, financial services and technology. The overall leasing market in Manhattan turned in another solid quarter. Manhattan absorption was a positive 1.2 million square feet, brining the vacancy rates down to 8.8%.","Turing now to our own performance in our New York office portfolio release 424,000 square feet in 26 transactions at average starting rents of $82.07. Same-store growth for our New York office portfolio was strong during the quarter, positive 6.6% on a GAAP basis and 8.1% cash. The broad diversity of our larger leases for the quarter is a reflection of the overall health of the New York economy.","The expansion of a tech tenant of 770 Broadway by 77,000 square feet, the renewal of the financial services tenants for 76,000 square feet at 280 Park, the expansion of the healthcare company by 53,000 square feet at One Park, and a renewal expansion within apparel Company for 84,000 square feet at a 100 West 33rd Street.","The balance of our activity was with midsized tenants that represent the sweet spot of our diverse portfolio. The mark-to-markets in our office business were a positive 62.5% GAAP and 50.3% cash. Even if you exclude a single lease of 770 Broadway, which was multiples of the old Kmart rent of $33.50 per square foot. The mark-to-markets for the quarter was still a very strong positive 20.2% GAAP and 12.5% cash.","At 96.8% occupancy, our office portfolio was over 1,300 tenants remain substantially full. The single largest block of space currently available is 89,000 square feet. Of our remaining 2018 lease exploration of 576,000 square feet and our 2019 lease exploration of only 691,000 square feet, 40% is concentrated in Penn One and Penn Two, where we remain aggressively focus on advancing our redevelopment efforts, which will commence later this year, as we combined these buildings into a 4.3 million square foot complex that it can offered best-in-class amenities along unmatched access to transportation.","Our leasing machine remains very active with over 400,000 square feet of leases and active negotiation and an additional 1.2 million square feet in the pipeline. On the development front, we have been very busy. We will soon deliver 61 Ninth Aetna as its sublease effort advance. In the second quarter, we will also complete 512 West 22nd Street along the High Line. The building looks great. You should go see it and we have robust leasing interest across all floors at triple-digit rents.","We expect to complete our boutique SOHO new development at 606 Broadway in the fourth quarter and we are working on a lease for all of the office space in the building again at triple-digit rent. And of course, there is a Farley Building where extraordinary progress is being made on the dramatic Moynihan Train Hall, which includes the installation of new escalators and advanced work on the two monumental skylights.","We are also moving forward with the private development work, which will include 730 rentable -- 730,000 rentable square feet of office space and a 120,000 square feet of Train Hall retail, all to be delivered by 2020. We are seeing great interest in this space and if you may have read in the Wall Street Journal, part of our leasing effort is directed at the life sciences industry. Many of the major pharmaceutical another life science companies are headquartered in Suburban New Jersey at Office Park.","As these companies think about how to compete for millennial and post-millennial employees, they are thinking hard about expanding in Manhattan and where better to do that and directly on top of the expanded Penn Station, which also will be directly accessible to Amtrak and the Northeast corridor from Washington to Boston and Cambridge. We\u2019re confident that the future of the life sciences industry in New York is on the west side. Our life science leasing effort also dovetails with city and state programs to grow this industry, stay tuned.","Let me now turn briefly to our best-in-class Street retail business where our same-store performance for the quarter was down 1.3% on GAAP basis and up 0.2% cash. The overall retail market remains relatively weak, but a number of successful retailers are choosing strategically to relocate and build new stores. Those moves have accrued to the benefit of our portfolio, witnessed Sephora and Levi\u2019s at our 1535 Broadway in Times Square and now Forever 21, which is relocating along 34 Street, a block and half west on the corner of Seventh Avenue across the street from both Macy's and Penn Station.","The submarkets with a highest footfall and greatest visibility continue to generate the greatest interest for retailers and that includes Time Square and Penn Plaza. For the quarter, we signed seven retail leases totaling 77,000 square feet, all of which were in the Penn Plaza district. While we\u2019re pleased with the 43,000 square foot Forever 21 lease, as we expected the reduction in rents relative to the former H&M lease for that space resulted in negative mark-to-market in our retail business of 12.3% GAAP and 20.1% cash.","However, if you isolate that lease out, our remaining retail leases produced positive mark-to-market of 19.2% GAAP and 4.9% cash. Again, all of those leases were in the Penn Plaza district. This rent growth shows the resilience at our Penn Plaza retail portfolio, thanks to the unmatched foot traffic. We've eliminated the Forever 21 lease to just a five year term, positioning us to take advantage of rent growth as our transformation of the district proceeds as well as maintaining our development options for the site.","At theMART in Chicago, this 3.7 million square foot asset literally is full with an occupancy now at 99.1%. We signed a 40,000 square foot lease expansion with the tech tenant, which now occupies 149,000 square feet. For the quarter, on a total of 119,000 square feet of leasing activity at average starting rents of $50.39, our mark-to-markets were positive, 36.6% GAAP and 28% cash. Same-store growth at theMART was 3.4% GAAP and 10% cash. And this strong growth should continue as we bring to market the former Publicis space which expires later this summer, a 132,000 square foot block that is well below market.","Finally, turning to 555 California Street, in the first quarter we completed 89,000 square feet of leasing activity and finalized the lease up of the redeveloped adjacent historic 315 Montgomery building. Next store, a redevelopment of the iconic cube, the old BoA Banking Hall is underway and we are trading paper on a triple-net lease for the entire 77,000 square foot building at this iconic San Francisco corner. For the quarter, our same-store growth for the three building 1.8 million square foot complex was 12.3% GAAP and 13.3% cash.","Let me just conclude by saying, the New York economy continues to grow and with its demand for office space. We remain full. We have a robust development and redevelopment pipeline, all of which is in the perfect submarket.","Let me turn the call back to Steve.","Steven Roth","Thank you, David. We are happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Michael Bilerman from Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","Steve, I was wondering if you could talk about Penn Plaza, the promise land as you noted in your churns later, but talk about from a perspective of the potential capital overtime to develop and redevelopment, the developed, against the backdrop of your comments that the public market has been more challenged from a realty perspective and hasn\u2019t grown a lot of people want to invest in private relative to public. How do you sort of see the public markets being able to fund that development and redevelopment within Vornado?","Steven Roth","So, first of all, Vornado has been rewarded for its contrary and early investment in Penn Plaza enormously. Our basis and most of the assets in Penn Plaza when I am talking about millions and millions of feet is about $200 a foot, and I don't know what the buildings would sell for today, pick a number, say 900 hours a foot, you all can do the multiplication, $700 a foot times all that square footage is an enormous value creation. That's the first thing.","The second is that Penn plaza had always been years ago the cheapest submarket in town. That's going to change and it's going to change monumentally, but the timing of Penn Plaza was not yesterday, was not the day before. It's really now and the day after today. And by that I mean, Penn Plaza is right and lots of different ways, right for rent growth, its right for tenant demand, it' right for tenant demand now.","We have plans that we've already announced to spend 200 million on one Penn Plaza, which we have already announced. We believe will drive market rents up $20 a foot. So $20 a foot that's overtime, but the leases turnover over the five years cycle in one Penn Plaza or as David calls it now Penn One, so if you take a look at the math to $20 a foot kind of just 2.5 million -- 2.6 million square foot building is roughly $50 million and $50 million you can value.","Let net $200 to accomplish the transformation of the building that's a $4 a share increase in value, okay. On a $200 million invest at the increment. Obviously $200 million is an investment that Vornado can handle very, very easily with the no capital raise, no selling shares, no dilution and no partners. On Two Penn, we have various different plans, but it looks like we\u2019re going to go to Plan B.","Now let\u2019s talk about that for a second. I think you could characterize, Penn Station, now I am talking about the underground now. We are on the over ground but not the underground obviously. So, the underground of Penn Station is probably -- Joe, what\u2019s the good word, reviled? That's too tough, told you about. Okay. So, the Penn Station is probably one of the most disrespected pieces of infrastructure, for something that is the most important and busiest transportation hub in North America.","So from aesthetic point of view and operational point of view what have you -- it's not something that we are proud of, okay, but not something that the community is proud of, okay. So 10 years ago as you might remember, Vornado, the related companies at Madison Square Garden all got together and actually we signed agreement. So this was not a dream, this was a reality, a potential reality.","So move Madison Square Garden to the Farley Building which wouldn't allow for a total transformation of the -- which with daylight the station remove the building that was on top of it and allow for a total transformation of Penn Station in every way that would be -- that would have been the government's responsibility.","Now, we invested years in that plan when it became pretty obvious that a public sector, was not going to get -- was not going to be able to do it or get their act together that plan dissolved. Now while we were working on that plan, we were the subject of a fair amount of community criticism, it was a landmark that the Farley Building was a landmark building, lots of other things that is not necessarily go into, all of which were very small and I might even say penny, okay.","When the proposal was withdrawn and it wouldn\u2019t happen, the amount of remorse on the part of the entire community, government officials, the New York Times et cetera was astonishing, okay. Now fast-forward to today, Vornado has initiated a plan which granted is a very ambitious to basically, I said in my letter and I assume this is one of the things you're interested in, to raise the tick down Penn Two, tick down Two Penn Plaza and build that unlike the 5 million square feet of air rights that are trapped on top of Madison Square Garden, daylight the Train station and build a very significant maybe even two large buildings.","That would involve at the increment of -- incremental taxes, real estate taxes, et cetera which would have allowed a pirate to be created, which is a financing scheme, which would have given the government a very substantial amount of money, billions of dollars to transform Penn station, okay. It looks as if, now one of the things that we needed was we needed some help as you could imagine because it was a fairly massive undertaking and an enormous public good. It does not appear that that plan is going to go forward or that it\u2019s feasible for lots of different reasons although we are ready and willing to do it.","So if that\u2019s the case and if that land is not going to go forward, we are going to go quickly to Plan B. Plan B is taking Penn Two, which is a 1.6 million square foot building, skinning it, putting on a new skin which will allow for basically floor to ceiling glass, et cetera. New lobbies, entirely new arrival, new mechanical systems, et cetera, plus adding how many feet, David?","David Greenbaum","Better part of 300,000 square feet.","Steven Roth","Plus adding the better part of 300,000 square feet in a bustle, which would sort of like a doughnut encompassed the lower floors of that building, okay. That is a much more modest proposal than we had that I just talked about. And it's -- we're going to go to it and we're going to go to it quickly. That will involve a sum of money we haven\u2019t even announced yet the plans -- the capital spend or the returns for that on that -- but they are certainly well within the ability of Vornado to finance, totally off our balance sheet today with, no dilution, no investors, et cetera. And so that will also be a plan that will start in a couple of years, I guess, and finish in a couple of more years.","Michael Bilerman","Great. Thank you.","Steven Roth","Hang on. I'm not done yet, okay. I apologize, but I\u2019m not done yet. Obviously, after a long pursuit, we implemented and designated the developers that actually we bought a long-term leasehold on the Plan Building and that's under heavy construction, now we will create in their 700,000 odd -- basically 700,000 odd square feet, but what I believe and we believe will be the best creative office space in town plus a 120,000 square feet of train retail. Going across the Street, I think I wrote about what our thinking was on Penn Plaza, and we had numerous other sites, so we're very excited about it.","Now, it\u2019s not impossible that development and I think by the way Penn One and Penn Two, the development and the spending there is extremely modest in relation to the returns and results, but the rest of it is going to -- is pretty go decent -- I mean if we tear down the Hotel Pennsylvania that's a big project. So it's not impossible that the public markets don't like developing. And it's also not impossible that we might do something about that, what might that see, well, we make split up into a development company and an income company. I just don't know it's very premature.","Let me say one thing about development. This is turning out to be a longer answer than our prepared remarks and I apologize for that. So, we're very proud of the two children that we born over the last couple of years, Urban Edge and JBG Smith. Now the JBG Smith is interesting because it's attracting a fair amount of attention recently over the HQ2 situation. Nobody knows how that's going to turnout except I guess one man, those how that's good for now. Now I think and I've said this couple of times, the key to, the exciting thing about JBG Smith is that it has 18 million square feet of development rights in the best markets on the best land already paintwork inside their inside their investment.","The one thing that HQ2 is doing is that highlighting for the investing public and the real-estate public the scale, size and quality of the development opportunities that it has because it is leading contender for HQ2 that's certainly a validation. So JBG Smith is going through the development company and they are going to build 18 million square feet of brand-new, perfectly designed perfectly located amenity rich pattern. And we know one thing as we learn when we did the backward brokerage down there that this new product, trumps old product every day, so that sort of what's going on at Penn Station, Michael.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","I guess speaking with the Chairman's letter. We get a lot of questions here on footnote 5 which talks about potentially seeding a core fund of funds with Vornado's highly sought after assets. And then Joe starts that maybe you should separate retail into a separate entity. I know you kind of touched on that in the last answer, but could you provide more color on your thoughts regarding those two ideas?","Steven Roth","So let's start with the obvious, the opinion of the room is that the office companies and all of our brethren are selling at a very substantial discount NAV. Everybody is complaining about it. Every CEO that I know that I talked to is complaining about it. Our shareholders are complaining about it. Everybody is complaining about it. Now in my letter I tried to comment about my thoughts about that.","So what I started out with this is, is that let's just think about the REIT model for a second. So in the REIT model, we have an industry that has grown from Kimco's IPO to today to a trillion dollars of equity, and probably something like $2 trillion of assets. Well, that's enormous growth and that's a very big industry, but it only has a 10% market share of the commercial properties that it could owe and that 10% market share has not grown for years and years and years and years.","So the obvious is, is that 90% of investors that one own commercial real-estate office building, shopping centers, hotels etcetera to own them in a non-REIT format. So that's a very interesting starting point, okay. The second starting point is that public, now the stock floods away, and right now we are at a discount NAV, which doesn\u2019t feel as good, but and that\u2019s going to change over time. Believe me, the recycle -- prices are going to cycle for sure, but right now there is a very large discount and it's quite okay.","So, the observation is that public shareholders are willing to pay $0.75 or $0.80 on the value of a real estate asset, investors, pension funds, LPs etcetera, 90% of the investors in the world are happy to pay par or even a 102% or 103% of par, and they have long 20, 30 year points of yield. So obviously I and everybody else that I talked to in the management side of things are not happy. So what are we doing about it, well first thing is that in our industry one guy will find back stock, two, or three or four -- one day -- two or three or four others when are basically running their businesses, okay.","Now we are I think neither of those without getting into stock buyback, maybe we'll do that later. But we have been -- I think we\u2019re the only public traded real estate Company that has been mixing up or mix of assets. So over the years we had sold out of the medical business making a double-digit return, we sold out of the mark business, making a double-digit return but that\u2019s the misnomer because out of the mark business we got theMart building in Chicago and so that\u2019s probably the single best real estate, best - last 20 years, so the numbers are extraordinary.","We also spun off Urban Edge. We also spun off JBG Smith, okay. So we are doing things, we are mixing up our businesses. Now it's pretty obvious that what I believe is softness in retail is what is hurting our stock books, lot of people say it's me, okay. Well I take full credit for that and maybe a lot of people think that you why should the problem is I haven\u2019t appointed a success or the board hasn\u2019t appointed a success yet, okay. That may will be -- what I can tell you that in my opinion, the softness at retail is the biggest issue in Vornado right now.","So I think Joe suggesting, which he made years ago and I sort of hung out there as an idea is that if we separated the strip retail and we separated Washington, we separated Washington for two reasons the first was that it was not performing well and it was trading our stock down and the second is we thought it would perform much better with a world-class management team as a standalone company. So why we don\u2019t we do the same with retail. I will tell you, I am dying to find out what retail would trade at from a transparency point of view as an isolated business.","So anyway, so that's the thought and we are considering it, okay, I said in the letter, we are not done yet and we will be most done on churn that create value, shareholder value at. Now with respect to comment about, seeding a core fund, if you just go through the math and you go for what I say and given what you will know that the industry obviously our assets in the hands of a core fund with a different investment loop would be worth a lot more than they are today. We\u2019ll see. Thanks for the questions.","Jamie Feldman","And just a quick follow-up, I mean, do you think there's economies of scale of having retail and office together in New York?","Steven Roth","I think there's economies of scale of having the same management team we're on it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Couple of my questions were asked and answered. But I guess just a couple of quick things, Steve. Just to 220 Central Park South, I know they were kind of getting closer to completion on that asset. Now I was just wondering, if you could help us think through kind of the rest of the capital spend and then maybe when should we start to think about closings in capital coming back to Vornado? And then secondly, if you could just touch a little bit more on the retail and kind of maybe what your expectations are for just kind of trends in leasing spreads over the balance of this year and in the 2019?","Steven Roth","Steve, how are you? We have only a few apartments left, can I sell you one?","Steve Sakwa","Sure. I\u2019ll come to talk to you later.","Steven Roth","Okay, good. All right, so 220 Central Park South is proceeding apace, it is aesthetically and financially the best project that ever been done in New York and probably -- in New York and therefore in the whole country. The numbers are terrific and what it looks like a terrific, now you have nothing to do one after none -- give a call and I'll have somebody take you through. We will begin closings in the end of the fourth quarter of this year. We are not releasing information for competitive reasons and I think that's absolutely the right thing to do. The only information that we have released is two pieces. The first is I have said repeatedly that our sales are will be -- well in excess of our costs. So we\u2019re into -- we\u2019re well into profit already. And the second is, if you look at the NAV that we published in the fourth quarter materials is a number that projects what we expect the cash build from 220 to be. What was your other question, Steve, about retails?","Steve Sakwa","Yes. I just wanted to get, I mean obviously you had some roll downs this quarter, but you said if you back out the one lease. They were marginally positive, just without giving maybe specifics. What do you sort of think that rollover would sort of look like on the balance of lease income to this year and maybe in the 2019 and how people sort of think through sort of the downside or maybe we're getting closer to bottom here? How should we just be thinking about those rollovers over the next say, 18 months?","Steven Roth","The only thing that matters is three things, Steve. Number one, the locations that we have and the quality of this retail is the best in the world. There will always be a Fifth Avenue. There will always be a Time Square, okay. The second thing is that our income is protected by long-term leases on our Fifth Avenue and our Time Square property from high quality tenants. And the third is that, we have said repeatedly that our projections show and we are guiding that our income will not go below $304 million cash from retail. So, there's going to be people going out, people coming in and that's the bottom that I see, okay. With respect to the details of it, I'm not a position to give you that.","Operator","And your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra. Please go ahead -- from Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Two quick questions. Just first one retail. So I understand sort of the 3 million or 4 million of floor. Am I correct in assuming if we look into next year, given this is Sephora, Levi's lease, some of the leasing you did this quarter. We should expect a nice pump in that cash number next year.","Steven Roth","Joe, help?","Joseph Macnow","I think he is asking about 19, we expect it to be positive, but we are not guiding to that just yet.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, and then just on the non-core sales and maybe two quarters ago you outlined a bunch of non-core assets that you would start to look to sell, would generate an excess of billion dollars. Can you maybe just give us an update sort of on plans there and timing?","Steven Roth","Generally speaking, we are in the markets and active on about half of that, okay. The remainder of it is some public security which doesn\u2019t include any of the public securities by the way. The remainder of that those assets are either public securities that we have chosen not to execute on or that have time delays such as assets, such as loans which have the maturity data at the end of this year or at the end of next year or whatever, or something like Lexington -- not Lexington, NAREIT, which we have tax protection as you probably all know. So, we are in the market and half of those and it's going to be slower going. This is not just a single trade. So, we expect that cash to come in over the next year or two.","Operator","And the next question comes from Daniel Santos from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","It's actually Alex on for Dan. So, one, I appreciate your success and comments that you discussed earlier. My two questions are on the development side, Penn Station certainly, there has been no shortage of political noise around the project from between the governor or the mayor. You've outlined a pretty bold redevelopment plan in the chairman's letter with sort of options for doing more for that part of talent. How much of your undertaking is needs the governor and the mayor to play ball? Or everything that you outlined you can undertake on your own without those two having to reconcile their differences there?","Steven Roth","As you would expect we must plan the business to be able to function on our own. So, we own the up ground -- we own over ground -- we own the real-estate above ground. Our plans are to execute our development plans with no assistance from the governments or what have you, okay. We don\u2019t need that just like any of the location. However, since Penn Plaza is a unique area and the Penn Station situation is very interesting and very important from a community point of view or political play view and a business point of view, there are potentially other things that we could do improve the situation, okay. So while we pursue those, we also pursue Plan B, okay. If I had a handicap it my guess is Plan B is going to be more actionable then Plan A.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay and the second is in your letter, you also mentioned what JP Morgan is doing, the redevelopment of their 270 Park. You for years talking about Manhattan tilting west and tilting to the south. Does what Jamie is doing at 270 affect how you think about future reinvestment for the Company?","Steven Roth","No, we have multiple children, we have multiple assets on Park Avenue et cetera and we love all our children equally. I think what Jamie did was stunning and courageous, and I think it speaks volumes do A, the fact that Park Avenue is still Park Avenue. And B, that 50 old buildings don\u2019t work for high tech build companies like they are bank, okay.","So what we think is the most important thing is that there is just doesn\u2019t affect demand on the west side. There is still enormous amount on the west side at very substantial rents. The difference is, is that a tear down on Park Avenue and we think we have at 350 Park, we have the single bid. That\u2019s example or the best opportunity requires rents which are very substantial and quite a bit higher than the west side. So each of those districts and submarkets will function, and I think with what\u2019s going on in New York both of those -- both the mid-talent, the traditional mid-talent sub-market and a new merging west side markets will both drive enormously.","Operator","And the next question comes from Nick Yulico of UBS.","Nick Yulico","Just want to go back to the Forever 21 lease. David, I think when you said that, it was a five year term and you thought that was attractive since the Penn Station area gets revitalized. You would be able to roll that lease in five years. But what I am wondering is whether you actually had retailer interest in a longer term lease because I think there is as a perception out there that retailers continue to go for shorter term deals?","David Greenbaum","Forever 21, Nick, in fact their preference would have been to do a longer term lease. We were the one who and we started the conversation with them, told them that we want to eliminate to five years and that\u2019s for two reasons. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks; one, because the District continues to improve, we see continued growth in that marketplace; and two, that building and that piece of land on 34 Street which run through the 33rd Street, we also own another piece on that block and several others, we see someday as a potential development side.","Nick Yulico","And just following up on that deal, it looks like that the roll down there alone on that lease was that could have been 35%, 40% on a cash basis. I mean how should we think about the risk of another roll down of that size on the next couple of years based on your lease exploration schedule or any retailers that you might be willing to get us early in your buildings?","David Greenbaum","I mean it's going to depend realistically space by space in the portfolio. Just as the balance of the space is that came up for this quarter all which were in the Penn Plaza District had roll ups. We told you in the past, we see a number of roll ups in the portfolio including space in the Penn Plaza District, including space on Fifth Avenue. We see some of the spaces that are coming up over the next couple of years where they maybe some roll downs primarily on Madison Avenue.","So look, first of all we\u2019ve said that the income is not going to go below $304 million, okay. That contemplates the roll downs that we expect, the roll ups that we expect and the vacancies that we expect and the move outs that we expect, okay. That's projected out for a period of time. That's the first thing. The second thing is, there are plenty of under market rents in our portfolio, so, for example, just take Kmart. So we have probably, I don\u2019t know 300,000 feet of Kmart left at $30.50 a foot and I think we showed you at 770, what can happen in that space.","So there will be roll downs, there will be move outs. We\u2019re prepared for them. This is a business which has $1.5 billion of NOI and $2 million or $3 million roll down here is part of the business. We\u2019re confident in our $304 million number and we're also confident in the quality of the real estate that we have. This is going to cycle out. Everything will be fine.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jed Reagan from Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan","You mentioned cash same-store NOI growth this year would be nicely positive, which seems more upbeat than the kind of flattish comments you provided on the last call, and -- so I guess, has something changed? Was that a comment for New York City specifically? And then I think you put up 5% to 6% for the New York business this past quarter, so just wondering if that we should expect that to decelerate over the rest of the year kind of how to think about that?","Steven Roth","So we strive to be respectable. Do you get it?","Jed Reagan","Not following you exactly.","Steven Roth","That\u2019s the way you described our earnings in your $0.02 remarks overnight, okay, so which we kind of chuckled over because we thought that our earnings was spectacular and now if the spectaculars are better for than respectable.","Jed Reagan","Fair enough.","Steven Roth","I think that the way we have described that we took a whopping for the word, flattish, in the last call. Now, we were trying to tell our investors what to expect, and I think that was lot of people thought that was an inarticulate way to do it and we agreed. So, we tried to improve it a little bit by saying, GAAP and we expect GAAP to be flat, although cash to be up, when I say nicely smartly, okay? So, we're not defining nicely or smartly because we don\u2019t give guidance, but we\u2019re trying to put parameters around, but we believe that notwithstanding the blow out quarter we had in the first quarter, the balance of the year will end up at the end of the year with the flat GAAP.","Jed Reagan","Okay. And that applies to New York, specifically business?","Steven Roth","No, no. That\u2019s the entire business -- that\u2019s the entire business, one pluses, one minuses, all of which that are out there. New York office continues to roll along in very good shape.","Jed Reagan","And looking at out to 2019, any retail move outs your expecting at this point?","Steven Roth","No, I don\u2019t think I have that information at my finger tips right now. We have one move out in the Fifth Avenue complex and that's the maximum duties as our store at 689 Fifth Avenue, which we believe is under market. But other than that in Penn Plaza -- I am sorry not in Penn Plaza, in Time Square and in Fifth Avenue, the answer is no other than that one is Arab store. In Penn Plaza and the rest of the place, there are small move outs and small moves in to all over the place, it's a large portfolio.","Jed Reagan","And there is one more from me. Steve, you mentioned early on the call about potentially splitting up into your development company and income company. Can you just elaborate on that a little bit and how you think about putting up assets between those two entities? I mean, would there be just a pure development company potentially?","Steven Roth","Jed, I really can't and I'll tell you though, but I do make the observations, and you guys are the architects of this that the public market doesn\u2019t like development, okay. For lots of different reasons all of which are right, but they are not right. And so we believe that in Penn Plaza, we have to do development because that's the nature of the assets. JBG Smith has to do development because that's a nature of the more land that they have.","So what I'm saying basically is that developing is not a business that can be measured quarter-to-quarter, but the objective of it is to end up with a series of brand new perfectly designed, perfectly located building. So it's basically it's important.","Now if the public markets don\u2019t like development and we are going to end up with a stock price that's going to be dinged for a long period of time because we have to do development that doesn\u2019t make intellectuals a sense. So we'll have to just figure that out. So all I'm saying is that something that we are aware of and it's something that our counsel loans, we are hard at work on what the next steps are to close the gap for Vornado.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","This has been intellectually very stimulating. By the way there is just one guy down at Baltimore who just loves development, okay. Question, if you woke up tomorrow and found out that you were a stock not a collection of real-estate assets, and NAV was not evaluation metric and was never going to be evaluation metric anymore, and it all going to be about cash flow and cash flow growth. How would you run your business differently?","Steven Roth","You've outsmarted with that question. I don't know. I don\u2019t think we would run it any differently. Another words, we are in the value creation business through the media of real-estate, and I don\u2019t think we would run it any difficultly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","Steve, it's a follow-up. As you have to think about the variety of options that you sort of look at out on the call at this development and income companies splitting at retails, seeding a core fund or funds with your assets. When you step back, how does sort of a privatization given all of the private capital is out there? Or a strategic public-to-public merger which has been increasing of late in the REIT sector, how do those options sit alongside these other opportunities that you are examining?","Steven Roth","Michael, of course, they are on the blackboard and of course they are -- as we do, we consider all the options, but I have no comment beyond that.","Michael Bilerman","And then just on this core fund idea, I guess how does that create value for Vornado shareholders other than emulating the fact that the assets have an NAV value beyond how does putting them into a fund and then that fund going out and acquiring assets at market prices? How does that ultimately derive value in your view for Vornado shareholders?","Steven Roth","Michael, I am not prepared to answer that -- I am not prepared to get into the complicated workings of an answer to that question here.","Michael Bilerman","Just maybe I wasn\u2019t sure how the that idea sort of would be executed, whether it\u2019s the net private format or whether it's similar to the fund that you created, coming out of the recession or you went out and bought assets, but instead of putting cash in, you\u2019ve put your assets in for your equity. I just wasn\u2019t sure whether that was contemplated in the public vehicle or a private vehicle, where else going with it?","Steven Roth","This is all premature. These are glimmers of value creation ideas and I can\u2019t get into a debate or dialogue with you about execution detail.","Operator","And your next question from Jed Reagan from Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan","Hey guys just a quick follow-up as well. In the shareholder letter than again earlier Steve you talked about the potential ground-up development at Two Penn Plaza using transferred air rights, which sounds like maybe that\u2019s the likely scenario at this point. But can you just talk a little bit about the ownership of those air rights and maybe the mechanism by which Vornado could obtain them, if you decide to go with that, I guess Plan A?","Steven Roth","The air rights on Two Penn Plaza and Madison Square Garden are a single tax swap, in fact when you go into Madison Square Garden we manufactured the chilled water for their air conditioning system, so, we\u2019re compadres. When the original deal was created and I say this sort of carefully, the original grand Limestone Penn Station was torn down, which by the way as we all know was the reason that\u2019s the landmark laws were instituted in New York in any event.","So at that point, there was an agreement to split the air rights on that block and that agreement has been modified a couple of times over the years and it still exists. So we owned the air rights together with Madison Square Garden and a proportion that is something we\u2019re not going to get into today, but it's not -- totally not totally even but it's not that far from even. But in addition there are -- those air rights are qualified for a transit bonus which consist probably about 1.5 million, 2 million square feet otherwise little over 2 I think.","David Greenbaum","Little over 2 million.","Steven Roth","So basically of the 5 million square feet of air rights that I speak about, 3 million of them are owned by Lee and Madison Square Garden. And then 2 million of them would come by virtue of transit bonuses, which would have a modest cost because the private party puts up the money to improve the transit in the neighborhood. So that\u2019s the math.","Jed Reagan","How do you guys account for that in your internal NAV, if at all that the one you\u2019ve published periodically?","Steven Roth","Zero.","Jed Reagan","Okay.","Steven Roth","Air rights have -- they may have a theoretical value to some people. But to me, they only have value when they\u2019re actionable.","Jed Reagan","Right, that makes sense. And just one other one and you talked about the life science at Farley potentially go in that direction. Could that add to the cost of the project? And how could it expect may be impact expected economics? And would that necessitate bring in another partner?","David Greenbaum","Jed, good morning. It\u2019s David. No, there is -- there will be no reason to bring in another partner into this transaction. We obviously are exploring life science industry and are walking a number of those tenants through building, in fact, the next month, actually later this month in May. We, of course, also are talking to what I will call the traditional tech companies that fully appreciate and understand the unique nature of this piece of space.","As we look at the building, you think about the asset, it is effectively a 67 storey building that is lying on its side as a five storey building. I mean an idea of the extraordinary footprints that this building can provide to tenant as well most importantly, the indoor\/outdoor space, the roof space on this building can provide the better part of two acres of roof space, again, similar to what we learned when were out in Silicon Valley.","In terms of the incremental costs for doing life science, we've basically budgeted those cost, we're not going to get into that today on the call. There are some incremental costs in terms of venting and air systems. But obviously that's all only going to make sense to the extent the life science tenants are in fact to pay rents higher than some of the traditional tenants that we see for this space. Based off of our market knowledge being the Cambridge market and other areas, the life science tenants in fact seem to be paying significant premiums for that space.","Steven Roth","There are a couple of REITs that specializes in that product type. There's one or two that has that product type varied into larger companies. Our observation is the math on that product type is satisfactory to even better than satisfactory, and it\u2019s even better than conventional office. So the answer to that is that we've accounted for all that. We have not before even before had assets that we thought were attractive to that industry. We now have and we're pretty excited about that actually. In terms of you said something about bringing in a partner, we have no need nor interest in bringing in a partner.","Jed Reagan","Would you built in the flexibility to go to convert it to lab even if you did go with your tech tenant?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is, I don\u2019t know.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now turn the call back over to Steve Roth for final remarks.","Steven Roth","Thank you everybody. We are pretty proud of this quarter and we are happy to share all of our thoughts however broad they may be with you, and we look forward to next call in three months. Thanks everybody.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"21881":["Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) Q3 2012 Earnings Call November  2, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","","Cathy Creswell \u2013 Director, IR","Michael Fascitelli \u2013 President and CEO","David Greenbaum \u2013 President, The New York Office Division","Mitchell Schear \u2013 President, Charles E.

My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. (Operator Instructions)","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Cathy Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s third quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our third quarter earnings release and filed our Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents, as well as our supplemental financial information package, are available on our website, www.vno.com under the Investor Relations section. In these documents and during today\u2019s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.","The reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, Form 10-Q and financial supplement. Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form10-K, for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. The call may include time sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today\u2019s date. The company does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","On the call today from management for our opening comments are: Michael Fascitelli, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Greenbaum, President of the New York Division; Mitchell Schear, President of the Washington DC Division; and Joseph MacNow, Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Steven Roth, Chairman of the Board will be present for the duration of the call.","I will now turn the call over to Michael Fascitelli.","Michael Fascitelli","Thanks, Cathy. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We are happy you are all joining us today and appreciate your time and attention. After my opening remarks, David Greenbaum will talk about our New York business and Mitchell Schear will talk about our Washington business, followed by Joe MacNow who will provide a financial overview of the quarter and then we\u2019ll answer your questions. We will end at 11 o\u2019clock.","Before getting started, I would like to acknowledge the devastation the Northeast suffered from Hurricane Sandy. This tragedy which cost over 100 lives thus far and tens of billions of property damage affected our home base in New York and Washington, particularly in New York, which was hardest hit. I\u2019m pleased to report that we suffered no personal injuries and only minor property damage. I want to thank all of our people for the incredible job they did and express our best wishes to all those affected by the hurricane as they recover.","David and Mitchell will comment further, particularly David, on the specifics for their businesses. Overall, I\u2019m quite satisfied with our third quarter results, which were $0.01 better than last year\u2019s third quarter. In spite of the downward pressure coming from BRAC in Washington DC, an old story, it\u2019s interesting to note that if Washington would have been leveled this year to last, we would have had comparable FFO performance over the prior year\u2019s quarter of 7%.","The Washington office market is sluggish and the New York office market, lacking support from the financial service industry, is locked in neutral. However, it is clear from our financial results that our New York portfolio is outperforming the market and our Washington portfolio is outperforming the projections we provided in our public filings. David and Mitchell will expand on this in a few minutes.","Let me update you on asset sales, part of our program to simplify and to recycle capital into our core portfolio of high quality office and retail assets. In the third quarter, we closed on the previously announced sales of the Washington Design Center, Washington Office Center, the Canadian Tradeshow Business and Dorchester, a non-core strip shopping center. Total proceeds from these sales were $323 million with a third quarter net gain of $149 million.","Importantly, in the fourth quarter we announced the sale of two malls for $1.25 billion. The Green Acres Mall and Alexander\u2019s King Plaza Mall which were both sold to the Macerich Company. When completed, these transactions will produce substantial proceeds and gains and Joe will provide further detail in a few minutes on the specifics of these gains and distributions. We also announced the sale of Reston Executive, a three building suburban office complex in Fairfax County, Virginia for $126 million resulting in a net gain of $35 million. We sold the building on Market Street in Philadelphia which is part of the Gallery at Market East for $60 million resulting in a gain of $35 million. We expect to close both these deals in the fourth quarter.","In addition, we expect to close in the fourth quarter the previously announced sale of the Boston Design Center for approximately $72 million. Lastly, we sold our equity investment in Brewery to Brookfield Asset Management for $28 million. We will continue to hold $25 million of Brewery 4.75% 2018 debentures.","In summary, this year, we produced $2.3 billion of asset sales with a net gain of $674 million and expect to pay a special long-term capital gain dividend of $202 million or $1.02 per share for Vornado\u2019s share of King\u2019s Plaza. We intend to do a tax deferred lifetime exchange with the sale proceeds of Green Acres and others. We will continue to dispose of non-core assets. We just acquired a 25% participation in a $475 million first mortgage and mezzanine loans on 701 Seventh Avenue, a retail redevelopment property in Times Square where we already have two dominant properties in that market.","The yield today is 11%, which will increase after selling off our senior position. We will continue to invest in our existing assets and development opportunities. Given the current environment, our strategy for acquisition will be measured and focused on continuing to expand our leading New York City street retail platform and upgrading our high quality office property for our platform.","Let me now turn the call over to David to discuss the New York business.","David Greenbaum","Thanks you, Michael, and good morning to all. Before I turn to the results for the quarter, I do want to spend a minute talking about what we\u2019ve been going through here at New York City over the past several days. We have contingency plans for almost all occurrences and last Friday, as we began to receive dire warnings, we implemented our emergency management procedures coordinating all of our personnel to have round-the-clock coverage in all of our buildings.","Our engineers, porters, security guards and property management professionals, all were hunkered down during the storm. Some of them still today in buildings, which are dark, literally living in the buildings, sleeping in shifts on cots. I\u2019m enormously proud of our team for securing all of our buildings during the storm, and for communicating on a real-time basis updates to all of our tenants.","Most of our buildings did not lose power and have remained open throughout. Other than one small building directly in one of the flood zones downtown, which will take about a week to bring back, all of the buildings that lost power should be up and running as soon as Con Edison completes the repairs to its network, which we hope will take place this weekend.","Now, let me turn to the quarter, while the overall market in New York is tepid, we\u2019ve had a strong quarter. We leased over 500,000 square feet of office space in the third quarter, which took our office occupancy up 50 basis points to 95.8%. The highlights of our leasing activity this quarter are two headquarters consolidation deals, one in financial services and one in advertising.","At 350 Park, we leased 103,000 square feet to M&T Bank in a renewal and expansion transaction, which allowed M&T to consolidate its Wilmington Trust division, which it recently acquired into 350 Park Avenue. To produce the expansion space for M&T in this complicated deal, we terminated two leases early and also renegotiated two other leases.","At 909 Third Avenue, we leased 220,000 square feet to IPG, The Interpublic Group, which allowed IPG to consolidate offices from four different locations into our building. For IPG, we created a headquarters environment including dedicated lobby space and elevators, branding and a great outdoor terrace space.","To make this deal, we leveraged our existing relationship with IPG, which is also our lead tenant at 100 West 33rd Street where IPG occupies over 400,000 square feet. These two large transactions plus another 22 leases signed in the quarter had an average starting rent of $58.74 per square foot with a positive mark-to-market of 8.9% cash and 5% GAAP. Many of the flash analyst reports, which I read last night, commented on our CapEx. Our average TIs were elevated this quarter at $56.92 per square foot. That\u2019s because 75% of this quarter\u2019s leasing activity was new and expansion deals versus 30%, which was the case in the first half of the year.","Our year-to-date office leasing activity is a robust 1.5 million square feet, which includes some 620,000 square feet of leasing in our Penn Plaza office portfolio. The Midtown South submarket with its tight availability has been expanding to include Penn Plaza. In fact, Penn Plaza recently was reported to have the lowest Class A vacancy rate in Midtown at sub 5%. This has allowed us to begin to push Penn Plaza office rents and at One Penn Plaza, we recently have completed several deals over $60 per square foot.","For our entire 19.6 million office portfolio, we have a relatively modest amount of upcoming lease expirations with 156,000 square feet expiring in the balance of this year and 673,000 square feet expiring in 2013. This amount of upcoming expirations has been substantially reduced as a result of our aggressive forward leasing over the last several quarters. Let me now spend a minute talking about some market dynamics. Since last summer, the market effectively has been at equilibrium with the Manhattan vacancy rate hovering just under 10%.","Our occupancy, at 95.8%, continues to outperform the market as we do quarter in and quarter out. Renewals this year have made up the bulk of the transactions in the market enabling tenants to avoid capital expenditures. In fact, in Midtown, there\u2019ve only been three major relocation deals year-to-date over 100,000 square feet, the IPG lease, I mentioned earlier, is one of those three deals.","Uncertainty in the regulatory environment has also led the financial institutions to remain on the sidelines. However, our diversified portfolio of over 1,200 tenants is not reliant on any one industry. Take a look at the list of the major tenants in our New York segment property table in the financial supplement, and you\u2019ll see what I mean.","In years past, view space in the tower of the building was the first to go. With affordability being the theme of today, that trend seems to have reversed somewhat as tenants are focusing on the base of buildings, both for the value prospect and the flexibility larger floor plates provide for open space planning. This bodes well for the releasing of the former Citibank space at 666 Fifth Avenue. While you likely have read that Citi has moved out of the space, we will continue to receive rent through the lease expiration, two years hence, giving us considerable time to release the space.","Regarding trophy space, which includes our buildings at 640 Fifth Avenue, 888 Seventh Avenue, 280 Park Avenue, and 350 Park Avenue, while the market is not yet back to the premium seen before the financial crisis, there have been 27 transactions over $100 per square foot year-to-date. I\u2019m pleased to say that three of those $100 plus deals have been in our own portfolio, and we have two more in the hopper.","We have a long track record of transforming buildings to create value, having done it time and again, 770 Broadway, 1740 Broadway, 640 Fifth Avenue and 888 Seventh Avenue to just name a few. Earlier this year, we completed the total redevelopment of our 330 Madison Avenue property capped by over 400,000 square feet of leasing activity including headquarters transactions with Guggenheim Partners and Jones Lang LaSalle.","At 280 Park Avenue, the transformation is now underway with our joint venture partner, SL Green. Designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, the building will feature a new double height lobby spanning the entire Park Avenue block front and a winter garden interconnecting both buildings surrounded by new plazas. The receptivity to the overall redevelopment plan from the brokerage and tenant communities has been very positive. And while we are fielding lease increase, our experience from the many buildings we have redeveloped is that while the renderings are great, what the tenant community and brokers really appreciate is the quality of the redevelopment when they start to see it completed.","We have one other major transformation well underway at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, where we are dramatically upgrading the scale and character of the lobby, store front and elevators to match the stature of this two plus million square foot corporate headquarters building. This project is currently under construction with completion scheduled for the first quarter of 2013. The change already is dramatic. I\u2019d encourage you to go take a look.","Turning now to our Manhattan street retail portfolio, where we own the dominant 2.3 million square foot retail platform. We leased 183,000 square feet of retail space year-to-date with positive mark-to-markets of 19.4% cash and 27.2% GAAP. The retail market is very strong, driven by the continued growth in tourism which is expected to reach 52 million visitors this year. New York continues to be the gateway market for global retailers including, for example, Massimo Dutti, one of Zara\u2019s brands, which opened its first store in the United States at our 689 Fifth Avenue property last month.","Retail rents are now well above their all-time highs approaching $3,000 per square foot on Fifth Avenue and $2,000 per square foot in Times Square. In Times Square, last week Microsoft opened a pop-up store at our 1540 Broadway property for the global launch of its new Surface, tablet computer. Sales here have exceeded Microsoft\u2019s expectations, which again demonstrate the strength of the Times Square market. Both Massimo Dutti and Microsoft deals speak to the exceptional quality of our Manhattan street retail portfolio.","We continue to have great growth prospects in this portfolio of extremely well located assets with in- place rents averaging 30% under market, and by the way, many individual assets are multiples of that. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about the prospects for the development of the full block front of retail signage at Marriott Marquis, which is directly across from 1540 Broadway, the two best sites by far in Times Square.","The entire New York division, which is a total of 25.5 million square feet, we had a good quarter with positive same-store of 0.7% cash and 0.3% GAAP. If you exclude the Hotel Penn, which was weak this quarter along with the rest of the New York hotel market, the same-store increase is positive 1.9% cash and 1.3% GAAP. Now let me turn it back over to Mike.","Michael Fascitelli","Thanks, David. Let me turn it over to Mitchell Schear to discuss our Washington business.","Mitchell Schear","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everybody. While we in Washington, largely dodged Sandy, I have an incredibly competent team on the ground that was fully prepared for the worst. Our colleagues in New York bore the brunt of it, and really did a yeoman\u2019s job during this crisis. As you may know, our Washington portfolio is approximately 20 million square feet, concentrated in Washington DC and Arlington, Virginia, directly across the Potomac River in Crystal City, Pentagon City and Rosslyn.","Our footprint is about twice the size of any of our peers. I want to start by contextualizing the Washington Metro market in general. Currently, market demand is soft, but not as soft as many believe as tenants await election results and clarity of the budget crisis. There is leasing activity in the market. In 2012, the gross leasing activity is expected to be about 32 million square feet, which is actually on par with the 15-year average.","There is a lot of churn, but not yet enough absorption to eat into vacancies, especially in this peak BRAC year. Through three quarters of the year, there was negative absorption of about 2.5 million square feet in the market. Rents are holding steady, but concessions are up to attract tenants. Limited supply over the next several years will help to stabilize the market, but we don\u2019t really expect the market to gain significant traction until 2014.","Within our Washington portfolio, our year-to-date leasing velocity has been brisk, over 1.6 million square feet so far, well ahead of our projection for the full year. We are attracting good activity and consistently executing more than our fair share of deals at good rents. In fact, we have signed six new leases, each one of them over 50,000 square feet, as compared to one new lease over 25,000 square feet in all of 2011.","In the third quarter, specifically, we leased 435,000 square feet at very good average initial rents of $44.02 per square foot and this is versus 389,000 square feet leased in the same quarter last year. The GAAP mark-to-market was 13.8% and the cash mark-to-market was 8.9%. Of the total 435,000 square feet leased this quarter, government leases accounted for 170,000 square feet and the private sector leased 265,000 square feet. So despite a slow leasing environment in Washington, we continue to win business.","To start off the fourth quarter, we just executed a lease for 108,000 square feet to the Corporate Executive Board in one of our buildings that is about to be renovated in Rosslyn. With this lease, we have now resolved 871,000 square feet or roughly 36% of the 2.4 million square feet of Department of Defense lease expirations resulting from BRAC. This includes our plan to demolish the existing 350,000 square foot, 1851 South Bell building to rebuild a new state-of-the-art 700,000 square foot office tower at 1900 Crystal Drive. We received final and full approvals from Arlington County for this project in September.","Almost all of the BRAC relocations have now taken place and we\u2019re looking ahead. In our 20 million square foot portfolio lease expirations in 2013 are below our average with a very manageable 940,000 square feet expiry. Re-leasing the remainder of the BRAC space is a function of time and we will emerge stronger when completes.","We had a similar experience in 2004 and 2005 when the Patent and Trademark Office relocated. But, in the end, we benefited by re-leasing to a more diverse population of tenants and by increasing rents by over 30%. We are confident the same will be true this time, too. For the entire Washington DC division, same-store EBITDA for the quarter was down 6.9% on a GAAP basis and 9.2% on a cash basis due to BRAC.","Overall occupancy is 84%. Our residential portfolio, which consists of 2,424 units in Arlington and DC representing approximately 12% of the business is over 97% occupied and had a quarterly same-store EBITDA increase of 8.5%. And finally, we are delighted to welcome Nike to Georgetown with the opening last week of their new flagship 31,000 square foot store at our 3040 M Street property.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Mike. Thank you.","Michael Fascitelli","Thanks, Mitchell. I wanted to cover a few things of retail, non- New York City retail and talk a minute about sustainability. Our retail strips and mall team continue to perform. In the quarter, we had an 8.8% GAAP mark-to-market and our occupancy was 93.4%. While the shake outs in the supermarket industry in the closings and downsizings associated with Best Buy and others are a concern, this nationwide trend is less important to us because of the concentration of assets we have in the densely populated high-barrier to entry affluent tri-state area.","Our mall segment is much smaller and leaner now and the numbers show it. Occupancy is up11.6% to 94.2%. As a result of the Motorola Mobility Google lease and the EBITDA improved by $1.1 million to $13.7 million. The commitment of Motorola Mobility Google at the Merchandise Mart is having the positive ripple effect we thought it would have. We also benefited from restacking the showroom tenants in the building in a very efficient way.","Let\u2019s talk sustainability for a minute. We\u2019ve been working very hard on this front. Our commitment to sustainability is highlighted in our annual sustainability report available on our website and reprinted in Steve\u2019s Chairman letter. We think sustainability is not only good business and it\u2019s morally responsible and works to increase our profits in the end. Most recently, we are proud that we ranked number one in (inaudible) of our entire industry. And we were 87th among America\u2019s 500 largest publicly-traded companies and 500 largest companies internationally, that\u2019s quite an achievement.","By the end of 2012, we will have at least identified over 30 million feet in our portfolio, more than any other single owner nationwide. We are a leader in energy management and sub-metering and our efforts have resulted in significant reduction in energy consumption throughout our portfolio.","In summary, we are very excited about the future of our great assets and businesses, which are run by a very talented management team. We will continue to make Vornado, a simpler company and improve the portfolio and recycle capital and increase asset quality.","I\u2019d like to turn it over to Joe MacNow for the financial review.","Joe MacNow","Thank you, Michael. Yesterday, we reported comparable funds from operations of $1.14 per share versus $1.13 per share in the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Total funds from operations was $1.34 per share versus $1.05 per share in the prior year\u2019s third quarter.","First Call was $1.17 per share, as some analysts factor in non-comparable items into their estimates and others do not. Our non-comparable items in this quarter consisted of a $19.7 million after-tax gain on the sale of the Canadian Tradeshows, $12.5 million of FFO from discontinued operations and a $11.7 million gain on redemption of preferred units, $4.3 million of income from the mark-to-market of the JCPenney derivative position, partially offset by a $7 million Veridien impairment and other costs.","As Mike indicated, we announced the sale of the Green Acres Mall for $500 million to the Macerich Company. Net proceeds from this sale will be $185 million after repaying the existing loan and closing costs. The gain for financial statement purposes will be approximately $195 million. The tax gain will be approximately $304 million and is expected to be deferred as part of a like kind exchange.","The Green Acres sale is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2013, and is conditioned on the closing of the Kings Plaza Mall. Alexander\u2019s, our 32.4% owned affiliate, also announced the sale of Kings Plaza Mall for $751 million to Macerich. Net proceeds to Alexander\u2019s from this sale will be $481 million after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.","Alexander\u2019s gain for financial statement purposes will be approximately $603 million of which Vornado\u2019s 32.4% share will be approximately $181 million after adjusting for certain acquisition costs in Alexander\u2019s stock. Alexander\u2019s tax gain will be approximately $625 million, which is expected to be paid out to shareholders as a special long-term capital gain dividend this year. Vornado\u2019s share of the dividend is approximately $202 million or $1.02 per Vornado share, and is also expected to be paid out this year to Vornado shareholders as a special long-term capital gain dividend. The Kings Plaza sale is expected to be completed this quarter.","We have over $2.7 billion in liquidity at September 30. Our consolidated debt to enterprise value is 36.8%, and our consolidated debt to EBITDA is 6.6 times. In capital market transactions this quarter, we issued $300 million of 5.7% preferred shares and redeemed $255 million of preferred shares and preferred units with a weighted average dividend cost of 6.9%. This results in $3.1 million lower annual dividend costs to us and the $11.7 million gain in non-comparable items I just mentioned.","We refinanced two properties for aggregate proceeds of $248 million with a weighted average term of 10 years, which resulted in $49 million of net proceeds. The weighted average interest rate of the new loans is 3.3% compared to 2.3% weighted average interest rate on the maturing loans. That is a result of going from floating rate to fixed rate on one of those loans in the amount of $150 million. Now, the new loan has a 12 year term fixed rate.","We also unencumbered two properties by repaying $151 million outstanding balance on the mortgage loans, which had a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%. Of course, the source of that was our overnight cash balances which are at zero.","Importantly, we expect to complete the refinancing of 1290 Avenue of the Americas in the fourth quarter in a single asset CMBS for close to $1 billion replacing the $409 million mortgage that now exists on the property and with a much lower interest rate. We also expect to finance the acquisition of 666 Fifth Avenue retail with a $390 million mortgage. We are highly confident that the $721 million of remaining 2013 maturities will be refinanced at favorable rates as well.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn it over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from George Auerbach of ISI Group. Please go ahead.","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","Great. Thanks very much. Mitchell, with the BRAC moved outs largely behind you and the DC portfolio around 81% leased on the office side, how should we think about the timelines against that portfolio back to kind of the 90% occupied range, is that sort of a three to four year target or should we expect a bit of a longer lease up given some of the uncertainties you see?","Michael Fascitelli","Oh, even with my hearing aid, I have trouble hearing you. Can you talk a little louder?","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","Yeah, sorry about that. Just asking Mitchell about the DC occupancy levels, clearly you\u2019re sort of at a bottom now with the BRAC moveouts behind you, how should we think about getting the portfolio back to 90% occupancy, is that sort of a three to four year timeline or should that be a bit longer given the uncertainty in DC?","Mitchell Schear","As I said earlier, I think that our expectations for 2013 are relatively modest, and we expect to see traction in the marketplace starting in 2014. So, I would say that we\u2019re looking at a couple of year period once we get into 2014 to really regain closer to our stabilized occupancies.","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks, and Mike, you\u2019ve had a successful year selling assets in 2012, I guess thinking about 2013, how do you see the pipeline of sales? How should we think about the level of potential proceeds and what would you put at the top of the list of your wish to sell list?","Michael Fascitelli","Well. I think, George, we\u2019re going to continue to sell assets as we move into 2013, there\u2019s still a considerable amount of assets that we\u2019re \u2013 we want to sell and we will sell for over a period of time. I don\u2019t want to specify exactly the order in which assets are going to be handled, but I think we\u2019ll continue to do in a very measured and orderly way. And we will then look at each asset as we did in the case of Kings Plaza, we distributed that money, and here at Green Acres we\u2019re doing a like kind exchange depending on its tax and its basis, how to handle that.","The acquisition market is a competitive market. And we only are going to buy assets there where we think we\u2019re getting very good long-term rate of return on an adjusted basis that meets our hurdle rate. So, it\u2019s a process which I think we did a very good job so far and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. And as we do that, we\u2019ll obviously update you on the specifics in the quarterly calls and obviously in our filings. I will say this that we do have a very great effort that every asset that we sell, obviously improves the quality of the portfolio of anything that we would buy. So, that is one of the recycling themes that we will continue to emphasize.","Cathy Creswell","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Yeah. Good morning. Just sticking with the point, Mike, is there anything keyed up today, obviously the malls went through a big process and had unbelievable execution on those sales, so I\u2019m just curious as we think about the more near-term next few quarters, is there anything sort of actively being marketed for sale and just that we understand the magnitude of potential near-term dispositions?","Michael Fascitelli","Thanks, Michael. I think \u2013 I take it that you like the execution on that by that question, so thank you. I think that we have \u2013 The Plant still on the market for sale, and obviously, we have several other assets right behind that that are coming to the market for totaling approximately $400 million to $500 million, and we\u2019ll continue to do that as we go through the fourth quarter, and obviously into next year, these deals won\u2019t close in the fourth quarter, of course. So, and then each asset just like we sold the asset in Philadelphia, which was not core and we will continue to sell assets here and there that we think don\u2019t fit the geographies, that don\u2019t fit the profile that we want to go forward to it.","So, it\u2019s a process that we will generate a considerable amount further proceeds from, but I don\u2019t \u2013 Michael, I think as we go through, those are the two most immediate ones that we have on the market.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","And then just you said Steve was there, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s taking questions, but I had a follow-up just for Steve, in terms of the rezoning on the East Side it was something Steve that you had talked about two letters ago. Obviously there has been some progress on that front, I\u2019m just curious your take on where things stand today and what Vornado\u2019s key opportunities would be in that potential rezoning?","Steve Roth","Hi Michael, obviously since I initiated the idea several years ago and reiterated it in the second letter, we think it\u2019s a good idea. We think it\u2019s extremely important just to focus for a moment on Park Avenue, which I guess we in New York consider to be the number one corporate thoroughfare in the world actually, that it has the kind of economic incentives that developers need to tear down obsolete buildings and build new buildings. So, we\u2019re very \u2013 actually we\u2019re very pleased that the powers that be are working on it. The Bloomberg Administration is in its twilight years, they\u2019re trying to rush a plan through and we hope they succeed and we think it will be good for New York.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Thank you.","Michael Fascitelli","Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JP Morgan","Thank you. Good morning. Last quarter you said New York City rents were rising modestly and so I was just wondering if financial services kind of stays in this bit of a respite state, do you think there\u2019s the risk that as Lower Manhattan product comes online next year, we can take a step backwards or do you think there\u2019s enough absorption in other industries to kind of keep that modest growth going?","Michael Fascitelli","I\u2019ll let David take a shot at that one.","David Greenbaum","I think generally what we\u2019re seeing in the market is basic equilibrium. The expectation is that the actual availability\/vacancy rate Downtown as some of the new product, the World Trade Center and some of the buildings where tenants will be relocating Downtown to Midtown that we\u2019re going to be seeing some much higher vacancy rates Downtown. I think generally though what we\u2019re seeing still to date is continuing job growth in New York.","Year-to-date, we\u2019ve had about 30,000 \u2013 40,000, I think the number is about 43,000 office sector jobs, actually met just yesterday with one of the brokerage houses and their Chief Economist and the projections for 2013 are continuing job growth with actually acceleration as we get into 2014 \u2013 2015. So, I think next year is going to be relatively flat, I think as we get out to 2014 and 2015, I feel better about some growth in rents.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. And then just another question, maybe this is for Joe, as you guys pass special here, sell some retail which generally tends to have less CapEx than say office. How should we think about the dividend and AFFO or FAD on a go-forward basis as you get some pressure from those things perhaps and also you\u2019ll have the \u2013 in the next few years some lease up of DC, which will probably bump up CapEx, I\u2019d imagine?","Joe MacNow","No, fortunately some of that asset disposition, lack of FFO and taxable income going forward is offset by growth in our other businesses. So, the board tries to get the dividend to be somewhere close to recurring taxable income and I think that will continue and I don\u2019t think there is much upward pressure on a taxable income in 2013, but there is certainly no downward pressure on it either.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you. Good morning. I\u2019m hoping you guys can talk a little bit more about your latest thoughts on JCPenney kind of where do you think we are in the restructuring plan and what\u2019s your appetite for investment going forward?","Steve Roth","This is Steve. Everybody is looking at me for that answer. So, Jamie, hi, first of all, we remain committed to the investment. JCPenney will report their quarter a week from today, next Friday. Management is executing a plan of enormous change on that business, enormous change. This year, which is the transition year, is a difficult year. It\u2019s actually no secret that it\u2019s proving out to be more difficult than the management team thought. The second year, the recycle that begins in 90 days on February 1, 2013. We remain committed to the investment. We believe that the transformation of the \u2013 and the creation of a unique retailer and what Rod Johnson calls a specialty department store has the prospects of being enormously successful. This is a tough period. We understand that, but we remain committed to the investment. Thanks.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So are there certain benchmarks that are kind of goals that you want to see hit by in a certain amount of time? Like how do you judge when it\u2019s time to get out?","Steve Roth","I really can\u2019t answer that question. Obviously, the business is complicated. Obviously, we monitor the performance very carefully. I and other large investments are on the board there. And I really can\u2019t say anything more about that, Jamie.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you.","Steve Roth","Thank you.","Michael Fascitelli","Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Caton of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Chris Caton \u2013 Morgan Stanley","David, thanks for your commentary on New York. I was hoping you could revisit the retail. You mentioned rents I think are at peak levels, can you talk about that dynamic a bit? How have they trended over the past year or two, and to what extent has that been driven by the strength in retail sales and to what extent is that a desire by retailers to have a flagship store and accept a higher occupancy cost? Do you think the rents can continue to experience outsized growth?","David Greenbaum","I think the three markets where we\u2019ve really seen some significant growth in rents over the last year plus are on Fifth Avenue and Fifth Avenue effectively really is two segments from about 51st Street North and South 51st to 42nd Street, Madison Avenue and then Times Square, of course. We\u2019ve probably seen the single largest increase in rents on Fifth Avenue in the quarter from 42nd to 51st Street seeing rents effectively over the last year approximately double to a tad in excess of that.","As I said earlier, on Upper Fifth Avenue, we\u2019ve really seen rents approaching $3,000 a foot and that was in fact validated with the deal that we did at 689 Fifth Avenue with MAC earlier this year. And, again on Madison Avenue, we\u2019ve seen extraordinary strengths in the market. We have closed a number of deals at 11 East 68th Street, again at rents at and above $1,000 a foot.","I think as you look at some of the sales numbers, I guess the comment I\u2019ll make is, Times Square is an extraordinary market because it almost a 24\/7 market. As we\u2019ve looked at some of our retailers, some of them have approached sales per square foot of $6,000, $7,000 and $8,000 a foot on some small stores. So, I don\u2019t think these things are just \u201cadvertisements and branding\u201d. I think companies today and especially a number of the fast retailers that do their own production, these stores really are making money for them.","Michael Fascitelli","I\u2019d just comment also that SoHo has had a pretty good run in rents, also. In that (inaudible) if you look at retail, as David said in his comments, we have great well-located assets with a lot of rollover that will produce substantial mark-to-market gains.","And even if there\u2019s a pause in these rents at this level, it\u2019s going to be enormous mark-to-market and the demand for these assets are worldwide and the tenants, as David mentioned, and also the shoppers are worldwide, in terms of tourism around the world as well as tourism within the United States. So, we expect these markets to be very good long-term. There won\u2019t be a straight line up, there may be a pause as the market absorbs these new rental levels, but then you see more tenants trying to drive that. So, bullish \u2013 we\u2019re very bullish on this over the long-term.","Chris Caton \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks for that. And then \u2013 and the follow-up is on that mark-to-market. So, as you look at some of the renewals or expirations you get over the next few years, to what extent do you expect the tenants to renew in place and to what extent do you think you need to rebuild out the space?","Michael Fascitelli","It varies by case, I think \u2013 and take 640 Fifth Avenue in which H&M was their original flagship store which have gone up substantially, multiples, they chose to relocated to a cheaper site, and reduce \u2013 and so still have an increase in existing rent, but not the size of that, and we\u2019ll backfill that space with tenants that will generate substantial multiples than what they were paying, but it\u2019s case-by-case. Some tenants will renew, some tenants will downsize and renew, some tenants will seek more value-oriented locations, but it\u2019s hard to make a generalization, but you want the space to be desired by multiple peoples so you could push the rent vis-\u00e0-vis existing tenant or the tenants that might come in to occupy that.","David Greenbaum","The only thing \u2013 it\u2019s David, that I might add to that is at 640 with H&M having announced the relocation, it actually is a great opportunity for us, that lease comes up in 2015. We\u2019re out there now marketing the space. We expect actually, if we want we can get our hands on it probably sometime around the middle of next year.","Michael Fascitelli","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Andrew Schaffer \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Thank you. It\u2019s actually Andrew Schaffer here. First I just wanted to get some additional color on your investment host and how the 5.2% return was arrived at versus a usual developer 8% plus hurdle?","Joe MacNow","Hi, Alex. It\u2019s Joe. Well of course you might expect that that was a negotiation and you\u2019re right. There is a lease that gives us effective control over the retail redevelopment at the base and that lease calls for annual payments of $12.5 million a year plus a share of the growth in cash flow that comes from the redevelopment that we do. But, the underlying \u2013 and Marriott has an ability to put it to us after the retailers made a separate condominium from the hotel and we have a right to take it from them in a certain number of years. (Inaudible) Alex were you able to hear that?","Andrew Schaffer \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","I can\u2019t. It\u2019s actually Andrew and I cannot hear that.","Joe MacNow","Okay. What Steve said was, that the 5.2% was calculated based upon the existing cash flow. If it was a market price deal, the first digit would\u2019ve been a four or maybe even a three with a high second digit. So, we have a capital lease for $240 million, we have a capital lease liability for the same amount on the balance sheet. The income statement won\u2019t have any effect until it gets out of development and that\u2019s about the summary.","Michael Fascitelli","I want to just comment on, I know you guys focus on the going in yields on any of these deals. And it\u2019s not unimportant, but it isn\u2019t how we look at things. We look at the overall return we can create over a period of time. Sometimes we\u2019re buying well below market lease and that would justify a much lower cap rate that we could turn in a period of years into a much higher yield. And we look \u2013 and so the 5.2% doesn\u2019t really relate to the overall cost of capital of 8%. It\u2019s really what the asset can perform and generate over a period of time. So whether it\u2019s the Marriott deal or whether it\u2019s another deal, we look at that over a period of a holding period which could be as long as five to ten years or longer and then that has to meet that \u2013 clear that hurdle of our cost of capital.","Andrew Schaffer \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","That definitely makes sense. I was just trying to get a better understanding of that negotiation. And secondly, I was just trying to get a better understanding of what it would take in relation to the Kings Plaza sale for you to take or exercise your right to get this $30 million in stock from Macerich and if that\u2019s completely rated for tax purposes?","Michael Fascitelli","Yes. Yes.","Andrew Schaffer \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay, that was simple. All right, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We have five minutes left in this call. And we\u2019ll take one more question. The next question is from Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Hi, everybody. Hey, Mike I assume it\u2019s fair to say that, that Vornado expects to remain a net seller next year. But on the investment side of the coin, just curious where you may see the best opportunities today?","Michael Fascitelli","I\u2019m not going to speculate. We\u2019re certainly going to sell assets. If we found great acquisitions, we would certainly proceed with those. We\u2019ve been focusing on the core markets that we\u2019re in, we\u2019re focusing on the street retail in New York, as David mentioned before, particularly for value-added opportunities that may come with some releasing down the road or redevelopment down the road. Nyack is a good example of that, David, there\u2019s a process to go through, adding additional space, really working that asset over a period of time, to try to pay, as Joe mentioned, a $5.2 existing income going substantially up.","So, street retail in New York with value-added components is particularly a focus. We\u2019re looking at a lot of office buildings, I think there\u2019s an escalating volume of office deals coming to the market as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year. Bigger deals that might provide some opportunity. Obviously, if there\u2019s a lease rollover in some of those that will take place down the road, that could affect the \u2013 obviously pricing could affect the return potential.","So \u2013 and in DC, we haven\u2019t seen much distress in asset sales, despite what a negatively viewed market. If we saw a break here \u2013 we\u2019ve obviously been a net seller in DC, and we look at all these markets to try to find a deal that fits our parameters, Michael. So, I would say the acquisition market is not easy to find deals right now, that meet that criteria because there\u2019s more money and more demand for it than I think the deals volume right now suggests. So, we\u2019ll continue to look at it and whether we\u2019ll be a net seller or whether we will continue to sell remains to be seen.","Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Thanks. And then if I can ask one other question if we have time. I\u2019m just curious on Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, would you give a quick comment maybe on your thoughts on prospects for the business heading into the holiday period? And then with respect to a holding period, should we continue to assume that we\u2019re probably looking at maybe 2014 as maybe the soonest exit, you could probably do from that business, from that investment?","Michael Fascitelli","Oh, yeah. And we\u2019re right in the \u2013 I\u2019ll comment on the first part of that question. First, we\u2019re right in the middle of obviously the beginning of the holiday season which has been a little bit disruptive this week by the massive problems in the Northeast. But our hopes are good for this season. I\u2019m not going to comment specifically but we\u2019re in that period right now on the numbers, but obviously we\u2019ll have a better view of that post-Christmas. And the opportunities, as I said previously, and all the sponsors are looking for a very good exit at the right time. So, I would think that 2013 and 2014 will be a focus on how we monetize that investment.","Operator","Thank you. That\u2019s all the time we have for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Michael Fascitelli.","Michael Fascitelli","I want to thank you all for tuning in and giving us your attention and time. We know this is a particularly difficult time for many of you with offices in New York and maybe not even in offices in New York. We always appreciate your comments and we appreciate your questions. And we look forward to our third conference call coming up hopefully without the circumstances we\u2019ve had in the first two. So, we\u2019ll see you all later.

In these documents and during today\u2019s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, Form 10-K and financial supplement.","Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. The call may include time sensitive information that maybe accurate only as of today\u2019s date. The company does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","On the call today from management for our opening comments are Steven Roth, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; David Greenbaum, President of the New York Division; Michael Franco, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer; and Stephen Theriot, Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room are Mitchell Schear, President of Washington, D.C. Division; and Joseph Macnow, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thanks, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado\u2019s fourth quarter call and Happy Valentine\u2019s Day.","Let me start this morning with a brief update on our Washington spin and merger with JBG. On January 23, we filed a 405-page Form-10 with the SEC. This admittedly took a little longer than we anticipated from our UE experience, principally because we had to deal with two companies rather than one, and the second company was not an SEC filer.","We are targeting JBG Smith to launch at the end of the second quarter subject, of course, to final SEC approval. The Form 10 and our initial investor presentation, which was put up on the October 31, announcement date are available on our website at www.vno.com.","The JBG Smith management team will make a fulsome presentation to investors describing JBG Smith\u2019s assets, balance sheet, business prospects, et cetera, in the weeks just before the launch. It\u2019s worth repeating from our last quarter\u2019s earnings call how strongly we believe that this is a great deal for our shareholders.","This transformative transaction was very carefully constructed and it accomplishes all of our important goals. It creates too highly focused pure plays in Washington and in New York, each with its own stock price, which I view as a report card. And each will be the largest and leader in its market. Investors will be free to invest in New York, or Washington, or both as they choose.","The main event for us is our flagship New York business, which is more than four times the size of Washington. Separating Washington from New York will daylight New York\u2019s treasure trove of assets and superior performance, and it\u2019s the big fix for Washington. The JBG Smith will be the market-leading powerhouse with an unrivaled portfolio and substantial growth opportunities. In fact, I believe the new JBG Smith has the potential to be the fastest growing real estate company in the nation.","When we announced the spin merge, we said we would conduct an external search for a CFO to round out the executive management team. We both the Vornados the JBGers have reached the conclusion that the best and most qualified individual to build and integrate financial systems and controls, which meet our zero tolerance requirements was our own sitting CFO, Steve Theriot.","That decision has now been made and Steve who is 57 years of age will transfer to Washington D.C. and JBG Smith as CFO this week. Steve Theriot was our lead Deloitte audit partner for many years before we brought him in as our CFO four years ago, and he did a terrific job while he was here. Thank you, Steve.","Joe Macnow, who is 71 years of age and was Vornado\u2019s CFO for 25 years before Steve, will return as CFO on an interim basis while we conduct a search for a new world-class CFO. Joe and Steve were partners these last four years, so this will be a seamless transition.","Matt Iocco, our Chief Accounting Officer who is 46, will be taking over certain of Steve\u2019s responsibilities in Paramus, including serving as our Principal Accounting Officer for SEC reporting.","Now to RemainCo, which now is simplified, highly focused and New York centric. By the way, we consider theMART in the white-hot River North section of Chicago and our iconic 555 California Street in San Francisco to be nearly western suburbs of New York.","We had an outstanding and industry leading fourth quarter. To understand the financial performance of our core business, we need to make a few simple adjustments to isolate one timers. First, we realized $487.9 million of gain from the resolution of the Skyline properties debt. Second, we realized $160.8 million gain from the repayment of our loans on 85 Tenth Avenue, taken together those two amount to approximately $650 million of gains.","Third, variable accounting both gives and takes and we had to mark-to-market and we had a mark-to-market write-down of $41.4 million from our real estate funds invested in Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel. Stripping out these items, our FFO per share was up a very substantial 10.9% over the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Our New York business continues to put up industry-leading matrix. Fourth quarter same-store EBITDA increased 7.8% GAAP and 17.6% cash. Excluding Hotel Pennsylvania, the numbers were even better at 9.2% GAAP and 19.8% cash. Our New York office portfolio ended the year at 96.3% occupancy, said another way, we are full. And our New York retail portfolio also continues to perform very well. Fourth quarter same-store EBITDA increased 16.6% GAAP and 23% cash.","In Penn Plaza, we together with our partners Related and Skanska continue to work towards a spring\/summer closing of Farley. This grand development, which is scheduled for 2020 completion will include Moynihan Station with its spectacular train hall funded by the government and the best creative office space in town funded by the joint venture.","Farley fits perfectly into our Penn Plaza strategy and our West Side Chelsea strategy, where we have three other developments in process. We\u2019re very excited about our planning in Penn Plaza, which continues, while our buildings are full and rents are rising. Over the last five years, rents at one and two Penn Plaza have increased 30%.","I want to talk quickly about two of our best performing assets 640 Fifth Avenue and theMART in Chicago. On a call while a back I predicted that the retail rollover of 640 Fifth Avenue would be a four-bagger. Victoria\u2019s Secret opened its 64,000 square foot Flagship in October. And in the fourth quarter, we signed a lease with Dyson for its first U.S. store. The final math will amount to 3.7 times of prior rent.","And at theMART, the 3.7 million square foot building in the River North section of Chicago, EBITDA is up a startling 83% in the last five years. In 2016, we leased 270,000 square feet of positive mark-to-markets of 25.5% GAAP and 14.3% cash. Starting rents are closing in on $50 a foot.","theMART is now at 99% occupancy and the transformation from a collection of showrooms to tenants such as Motorola, Publicis, 1871, Yelp, PayPal, WPP, Conagra, Allstate, Bosch, Caterpillar, Conde Nast, et cetera, is almost complete. David and Glen and Myron and Paul have done an amazing job here. David and Steve will have much more on our fourth quarter results in just a few minutes.","Now to fourth quarter transactions. In December, the receiver completed the final disposition of the Skyline Properties and we removed 236.5 million of assets and 724.4 million of liabilities from our balance sheet, which resulted in a $487.9 million net non-cash gain. While this maybe a non-cash gain in 2016, we certainly did receive cash proceeds of $515 billion in cash back when the loan closed. No gain \u2013 no tax gain resulted from this transaction.","In December, we received net proceeds of $191.8 million in repayment of our mezzanine loans on 85 Tenth Avenue out of the property $625 million refinancing and we recognized a $160.8 million of income for financial statement purposes. No tax gain resulted from this transaction.","At inception of this deal 10 years ago, we negotiated the right to receive a 49.9% interest in the property for a nominal amount, which closed in December. The 626,000 square foot property is one of the best locations in the fast growing Chelsea West market \u2013 West Chelsea submarket and is anchored by Google. Also in December, we sold 20% \u2013 our 20% interest in Fairfax Square to our joint partner for $15.5 million, which resulted in a $15.3 million net gain.","A word about acquisitions and dispositions. While we have invested $606 million in developments and in other internal growth initiatives, interestingly, we made virtually no external acquisitions in 2016. This fact is a testament to our belief in what I have said repeatedly on recent calls, that the easy money has been made for this cycle, that asset prices are high well past the 2007 peak, that it\u2019s a better time to sell than to buy. And most importantly, that now is the time in the cycle when the smart guys build cash.","To sum it up over the past five years, including UV and JBG Smith, we will have distributed 9.7 billion of assets to shareholders through spin-offs and exited $6 billion of non-core assets, as against 3.9 billion of acquisitions, which were invested in highest-quality core in New York assets. And through it all, we maintained our common dividend levels.","Let me spend a minute on our real estate fund. To recount history here, we raised an $800 million fund from a handful of institutional investors in 2010 to capitalize on value-add opportunities in the wake of the great recession. Vornado committed $200 million, or 25% of this amount and it\u2019s the sole general partner earning fees and a 20% promote over a 9% preferred return to limited partners.","The fund invested $612 million from 2010 to 2012 acquiring 12 assets. Today, the fund is in harvest mode. We have exited six investments to date, generating an aggregate realized gain of $165 million at a blended IRR of 20.6% and a 1.7 multiple. The fund has six remaining investments with an estimated aggregate fair value of $433 million, four of which are in the for sale queue. The remaining two at Crowne Plaza and the 1100, Lincoln Road in Miami are longer-term holds.","The fund uses fair value accounting, which involves marking the assets to market quarterly a totally different methodology than the historical cost accounting that Vornado and all of our peers use. So, it makes sense that beginning in 2017 we will not include the fund\u2019s performance in our FFO as adjusted, which we had previously called comparable FFO.","On the governance front, last year we declassified our Board and are now electing trustees for one year terms. We also adopted a Trustee Resignation Policy. This year we will adopt proxy access. In December we elected Mandy Puri, age 57 as a new independent trustee. Mandy is a financial expert with outstanding qualifications which are listed in her bio on our website at www.vno.com. We are delighted to welcome Mandy to our Board and note that today is her birthday.","Please see page nine of our fourth quarter financial supplement for management\u2019s estimate of NAV. We intend to publish an NAV once each year as part of our fourth quarter supplement. To sum it up I\u2019m very pleased with both our operating performance and our progress on simplification and focusing the business.","Now over to David to cover New York.","David Greenbaum","Steve, thank you and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to begin with some perspective on the New York real estate market over the past 12 months. 2016 was quite a year, one in which we came to expect the unexpected, from a China slowdown and concerns of a disorderly decline in China\u2019s currency to continued stresses in Europe to the surprise Brexit vote and finally to the equally unexpected outcome of the US presidential election.","In the face of such uncertainty, the response to the New York market in 2016 was a testament to its continued strength and resilience. Overall leasing activity in Manhattan exceeded 35 million square feet on par with the 10-year average. Let me give you some perspective on the strong beat of our marketplace in New York. The comparable annual leasing activity number is about 7 million square feet in Chicago, the second largest office market in the country and about 10 million square feet in London.","Coming back to our hometown New York, asking rents for the year were up modestly and net absorption was a positive 2.6 million square feet. Available sublease space remains low by historic standards and at less than 2%, tenants are clearly not looking to shrink and give back space. Among the various submarkets in 2016 Midtown showed its continued strength capturing 25 of Manhattan\u2019s top 37 leases in excess of 100,000 square feet and 11 of 18 new relocation leases in Manhattan in excess of 100,000 square feet.","Perhaps the biggest story of the New York market in 2016 was the divergence of performance between new and recently renovated buildings on the one hand and commoditized office space on the other. Fully half, a disproportionately large percentage of the top 20 leases signed during the year were for new and renovated buildings. That\u2019s a trend, those observers expect to continue and that bodes exceptionally well for our fleet, which is in great shape after our recent redevelopment efforts.","Let me now turn to the question on everyone\u2019s mind. What will 2017 bring? What I will say is that our confidence in the continued economic vibrancy of New York has never been greater. One of the stated economic priorities of the new Trump administration is financial services deregulation. The administration\u2019s efforts in this regard could have a significant and positive economic impact for the city.","Let\u2019s look at the employment statistics. While overall job creation in New York remain positive in 2016, the rate of growth slowed to the national average after consecutive years where the city outpaced the rest of the country. The key metric that we look at office using employment grew by 5,000 jobs in 2016, reaching a new record high of 1,373,000 jobs. However, the increase was below the blistering pace of some 35,000 new office sector jobs added per annum in recent years.","For the past decade the dramatic growth in office sector jobs has been held back by the financial services industry, which shared 3,000 office using jobs in 2016 and remains nearly 30,000 jobs below the number of financial sector jobs at its peak back in 2000.","Since the election of course there has been a marked shift in the mood around major financial institutions. While that mindset may take some time to be captured in job numbers, there certainly is reason to believe that we may once again see increases in financial services employment here in New York with important implications for the real estate market.","That is just one example of how federal policy could benefit New York. Whether it is the repatriation of overseas profits, lower tax rates or increased federal investment in major infrastructure projects such as the trans-Hudson gateway project, the prospects for the local economy are bright. At the same time, local fundamentals remain strong, crime in New York City continues to fall and New York is the safest big city in America. New York is a Mecca for international tourists and investors.","And at the state level, Governor Cuomo continues to unveil and importantly execute on much-needed transportation projects around the region. Perhaps most importantly, the city continues to benefit from a virtuous cycle of talent and opportunity. Millennials continue to migrate to the urban core. They represent 27.5% of the U.S. population, but 31% of New York City residents and 35% are Manhattanites. And in turn the country\u2019s leading employers continue to come here and to grow here as they seek to tap into New York\u2019s massive pool of talent.","Just consider Google, an important tenant in our portfolio which a decade back first came to New York and today employs over 6,000 people in the city, some 10% of Google\u2019s workforce. There is every reason to believe that the next generation of tech leaders and other innovative companies will show similar growth potential seeking to tap into New York\u2019s growing pool of talent.","In short, business has been and remains good and all indications point to a robust future for our hometown. All this has been validated by the capital markets with New York, the absolute number one market for investors who want to put capital.","Let me now turn to our performance over the past year. In 2016, we leased 2,240,000 square feet of office space, including 302,000 square feet in Long Island City in a 148 transactions across our New York portfolio. We achieved average starting rents of $78.97 per square foot in New York, $39.84 in Long Island City, reflecting strong mark-to-market of 19.7% GAAP and 16.6% cash. Importantly, 20% of our 2.2 million square feet of 2016 leasing activity, some 450,000 square feet represented tenants expanding in New York, real growth real expansion to the city.","While we\u2019re proud of the flagship deals we signed last year with blue-chip tenants such as Bloomberg, PwC, Alston & Bird, Facebook, and AOL, the diversity of our tenant base is one of our greatest strengths. At our One Penn Plaza building along during 2016 released a total of 330,000 square feet across 43 separate transactions with an average starting rent of $67.37 per square foot. Rents in Penn Plaza continue to move up nicely.","At our 90 Park Avenue redevelopment over the course of 2016 we completed 400,000 square feet of transactions with PwC, Alston & Bird and multiple financial services tenants; Gramercy Capital, Agon, Valence and EverBank and Nuveen, both of which recently have been acquired by TIAA. This leasing activity brings the building to 96 plus percent occupancy and demonstrates the resounding success of our redevelopment program. We achieved average starting rents of $75.23 cents per square foot on this 400,000 square feet of activity and GAAP and cash mark-to-markets respectively of a positive 22.3% and 18.2%.","We also continued to outperform in the $100 plus per square foot marketplace. Well, we completed 11 of those leases for a total of 386,000 square feet in 2016, spread in six of our trophy buildings. 731 Lexington Avenue, 85 10th, 770 Broadway, 650 Madison Avenue, 350 Park Avenue and 280 Park Avenue, all at average starting rents of $118 per square foot. For the year we completed some 18% of the total trophy deals in the entire market, punching well over our way and truly a testament to the quality of our portfolio.","Let me now turn briefly to the fourth quarter, which also was very strong. We completed more than 625,000 square feet of leasing activity with our year-end occupancy at 96.3%, up 80 basis points over the third quarter. During the fourth quarter we achieved average starting rents of $77 per square foot, reflecting mark-to-markets of 7.2% GAAP and 6.6% cash. The 44 office leases that makeup the total for the fourth quarter are a great indicator of the strength of our franchise.","Robert A.M. Stern Architects signed a lease for more than 60,000 square feet at One Park Avenue, a move by a very discerning tenant that we view as an endorsement of our restoration of that historic building. At 280 Park Avenue we added Antares Capital for 60,000 square feet in the fourth quarter and just signed a renewal expansion lease for 40,000 square feet with Wells Fargo and a new lease with Orix USA Corporation for 20,000 square feet, both in the first quarter of 2017 bringing the building to 97 plus percent occupancy.","Leasing activity has been especially robust here at our headquarters at 888 7th Avenue where during the fourth quarter and into the first six weeks of 2017 we have leased nearly a 150,000 square feet of which a 130,000 represents new and expansion deals. The activity was headlined by a 40,000 square foot new lease with Hutchin Hill Capital, a 30,000 square foot expansion with Lone Star North America, and a 23,000 square foot new lease with Advent Capital. The building today is at 95% occupancy, up some 400 basis points from the end of the third quarter. There definitely is life in the financial services sector. Just look at our recent activity in 888 7th Avenue and 280 Park Avenue.","As we look forward and head into 2017, we were in great shape. Our 2,000 lease expirations are a very modest 490,000 square feet spread across the portfolio in small spaces, none greater than 25,000 square feet. Our leasing machine remains busy with 335,000 square feet of leases either signed year-to-date or in active lease documentation and an additional 700,000 square feet in the pipeline.","Our 2018 expirations total 1,150,000 square feet of which about half is concentrated at One Penn and Two Penn Plaza. We remain aggressively focused on advancing our redevelopment efforts for those two buildings and in particular for combining them into a 4.2 million square foot complex that can offer best-in-class amenities alongside unmatched access to transportation.","On the development front we will certainly be active over the next three years. In early 2018, we will deliver two best-in-class new builds at 61 9th Avenue and 512 West 22nd Street and our newest joint venture at 606 Broadway also will deliver. We will continue to advance redevelopment efforts at 260 11th Avenue through the Landmark\u2019s process and along with our partners at Related and Skanska will kick off the transformation of the Farley Post Office into the new Moynihan train station and best-in-class creative office space.","When you total the footage of these exciting projects and add the redevelopment of Two Penn Plaza, we\u2019ll be bringing 3 million square feet of new redeveloped space to the market. Importantly, all of this activity is taking place in the city\u2019s fastest growing submarkets, in Penn Plaza and along the Highline and in Chelsea. We are growing where the market is growing.","Same-store growth was robust for our office portfolio during the fourth quarter, positive 7% on a GAAP basis and 18.4% cash. This caps the year in which our office same-store numbers for 2016 were up 6.7% GAAP and 10.5% cash.","Turning now to a retail portfolio; in 2016, we leased a total of 111,000 square feet across 27 transactions with mark-to-markets of positive 23.4% GAAP and 11.9% cash. This included high-profile leases with the Starbucks\u2019 Roastery concept at our new build at 61 9th Avenue and the new iteration of the iconic Four Seasons restaurant at 280 Park Avenue.","The highlight of our fourth quarter activity was the signing of a 3,000 square foot lease at 640 5th Avenue with Dyson which will open its first flagship store. This lease was possible only because we were able to retain an important 25 feet of 5th Avenue frontage during our negotiations with Victoria\u2019s Secret in 2015 for its 64,000 square foot flagship.","The mark-to-market as Steve said on the combined Victoria\u2019s Secret and Dyson leases to the old H&M and Citibank spaces on a GAAP basis is a 3.7 multiple and a 2.8 multiple on a cash basis. For reporting purposes, our mark-to-market on the Dyson lease similes was a whopping 1,648% GAAP and 1,176% cash, but these metrics technically are not recognized since the space was vacant for more than nine months.","In our retail portfolio for the fourth quarter, we leased 10,000 square feet in four transactions. The reported mark-to-market for the fourth quarter of a positive 8.5% GAAP and negative 5.9% cash is solely attributable to one 6,000 square foot lease in the 33rd Street Concourse at Penn Station where we replaced an old Duane Reade with a new concept, a Pret wine bar, adding this food offering to a mix of our tenancies in the Long Island railroad concourse, including Shake Shack, Magnolia Bakery, Wasabi Sushi, Pret A Manger, and a new Starbucks.","Our retail same-store performance was very strong in the fourth quarter, up 16.6% GAAP and 23% cash. For the year, the retail same-store numbers were positive 10.3% GAAP and 9.6% cash. While it is no secret that the retail sector is experiencing some level of disruption and retail leasing has slowed, we believe our High Street retail portfolio will continue to perform well. The first quarter is active with 40,000 square feet of leases in negotiation.","Now onto theMART; in 2016 for the year we signed 64 leases for a total of 270,000 square feet at an average starting rent of $48.16 with positive mark-to-markets of 25.5% GAAP and 14.3% cash. During the fourth quarter alone we leased a total of 133,000 square feet, bringing to the building new tenancies; Bosch, advanced magazine publishers, Conde Nast; as well as an expansion with PayPal, which now occupies 110,000 square feet at theMART, all with positive mark-to-markets for the quarter of 27.1% GAAP and 13.9% cash.","Our same-store growth at theMART was exceptional for both the fourth quarter at 21% GAAP and 17.1% cash and for the full-year at 14% GAAP and 13.3% cash. In San Francisco, at our iconic 1.8 million square foot 555 California office complex, we signed eight office leases in 2016, a total of 131,000 square feet at an average starting rent of $83.86 per square foot with positive mark-to-markets of 25.4% GAAP and 19.8% cash.","For the fourth quarter, we leased 43,000 square feet, including two new leases with Pacific Coast Partners and Ripple Labs with positive mark-to-markets of 41.9% GAAP and 33% cash. This year, we expect to complete the building-wide modernization of the historic 315 Montgomery building, as well as commence the total redevelopment of the former Bank of America banking hall, we call The Cube into creative office space.","Our redevelopment of the retail concourse at 555 is now substantially complete and has been extremely well received by the tenant and brokerage community and the asset continues to excel. Just yesterday, we signed a renewal lease with UBS for 55,000 square feet.","555 and the complex, which host financial services giants; Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, UBS, KKR, Dodge & Cox, National Law firms; Jones Day, Kirkland & Ellis, Fenwick & West, Norton Rose, and consulting firm; McKinsey all of which tenants. Let me say that emphasize that again. All of these tenants have renewed their leases at 555 over the past several years now also houses tech, which we have brought to the building, including Microsoft and Supercell, a SoftBank company, all making 555 the best building in San Francisco.","We remain proud of our industry leading same-store growth numbers. Earlier in my remarks, I ran through the numbers for office and the retail portfolios. For the division as a whole, our same-store numbers for the fourth quarter a positive 7.8% GAAP and 17.6% cash. Excluding the Hotel Pennsylvania, those numbers would be 9.2% GAAP and 19.8% cash.","For the year, the division same-store growth is 6.3% GAAP and 8.6% cash, again, or 7% GAAP and 10.3% cash, excluding the Hotel Pennsylvania. These industry leading same-store numbers are a credit to the quality of our portfolio and to the hard work of our enormously talented professionals.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michael Franco, who will give you an overview of the investment markets.","Michael Franco","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m now going to spend a few minutes on the investment in capital markets in New York. After a record level of investment sales in 2015, Manhattan sales volume fell by roughly 30% to $42 billion in 2016, still a pretty hefty number and the second most active year since 2007. This reduction reflects both the shortage of high-quality offerings brought to the market and also widening of expectations between buyers and sellers.","Overall, we think the investment sales market of 2016 can best be characterized as one of thinner bidding pools with buyers cautious about the fundamentals across property types, including even apartments, the threat of rising rates, and the possibility that we are in the latter stage of the economic cycle. While the appetite in pricing for highest-quality core assets, particularly trophy office and retail remain quite strong. Pricing for commodity assets has come off as much as 5% to 10% and more significantly for land and hotels.","Foreign capital continues to be a primary driver of investment sales, making up almost 40% of the activity last year and remains a strong underpinning going forward. Foreign investors continue to have a strong desire to invest in the U.S. with New York City as the number one target. Most are still in the early stages of doing so, and assets like Vornado\u2019s are their favorite investment.","We expect the investment sales market in 2017 to be a continuation of 2016, a healthy though not robust market with values for stabilized assets remaining strong and those with leasing and other challenges suffering. Just as in 2016, we will remain disciplined in our approach to acquisitions. We are prepared to buy quality with vacancy, if priced right.","Turning to the financing markets. After periods of volatility in 2016, we are now open and liquid, especially for blue chip sponsors like Vornado. While the 10-year Treasury is up 60 basis points since the election, CMBS spreads have tightened and risk retention has been the Y2K of real estate finance, a non-event on large loans. Overall, we are seeing active bidding from all types of financing sources.","CMBS lenders, life companies, balance sheet lenders and foreign capital all of which is good for borrowers. On the other hand, the construction loan market has gotten quite a challenge for all, but the best sponsors, which we expect will help reduce supply going forward.","In 2016, we completed $3.8 billion of financings in 10 transactions, all at very competitive rates, as well as extended one of our two $1.25 billion revolvers at lower pricing. We appreciate the support of all of our line lenders and capital relationships in accomplishing this activity.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Theriot to cover our financial results.","Stephen Theriot","Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned, our core business was up 10.9% over the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. While Steve highlighted certain of the non-comparable items in his remarks, I\u2019m going to repeat them here, because they mask the very strong running rate improvement of our financial results.","Net income in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $3.43 per share, up from $1.22 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 includes $648.7 million of income comprised of a $487.9 million gain from Skyline and $160.8 million of income from 85 Tenth Avenue. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015 also include other items that affect comparability, which were highlighted in our earnings release in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.","After adjusting for all of the items that affect comparability, adjusted net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter is $0.30, or $0.16 below the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. The decrease in adjusted net income for the fourth quarter primarily results from a $41.4 million, or $0.20 per share unrealized loss on the mark-to-market of our real estate fund\u2019s investment in the Crowne Plaza, Time Square Hotel.","FFO as adjusted was $1.13 per share for the fourth quarter, or $0.13 below the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter, also primarily due to the $0.20 per share mark-to-market unrealized loss on the Crowne Plaza, because prior year income from the fund was included in our comparable results, so is this non-cash loss. Going forward, however, for all the reasons Steve mentioned, we will exclude the fund from our core as adjusted financial results.","Income for the full-year of 2016 was $4.34 per share, up from $3.59 per share for 2015. FFO as adjusted was $4.66 per share for 2016, down $0.09 from the prior year. See our earnings release or pages 42 and 43 on Form 10 \u2013 on our Form 10 for reconciliations of net income and FFO, the net income and FFO as adjusted.","Our FAD ratio was 112.5% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 109.6% for the full-year. Our FAD ratio was elevated in 2016 due to the capital outlays for tenant improvements and landlord\u2019s work related to the outsized leasing activity in the last two years ahead of the commencement of the incremental cash rental revenue. We expect our FAD ratio will return to its normalized level in the mid-80% level by the end of 2017.","Now to our Washington business. Our teams are working together to integrate the two businesses to achieve a seamless combination of talent, assets, and strategy. As Steve mentioned, I will be permanently transferring to JBG Smith as its CFO. I will lead the building of the financial systems and controls, which meet our zero tolerance requirements. While I will greatly miss being part of the team here at Vornado, I\u2019m excited to join the JBG Smith team as its CFO.","Excluding the Skyline Properties, which were disposed on December 21, 2016, our Washington segment EBITDA as adjusted was $290.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is flat to 2015, resulting from the net of an increase in EBITDA from the core business of $3.1 million, offset by decline in EBITDA from properties taken out of service of $3.1 million.","These results are slightly ahead of our guidance for 2016. We expect that EBITDA from Washington\u2019s core business will be approximately $2 million to $6 million higher for the first-half of 2017 over the first-half of 2016, offset by a reduction in EBITDA of approximately $6 million to $8 million from properties taken out of service for redevelopment, specifically 1900 M Street, 1800 South Bell, and 1750 Crystal Drive. Accordingly, we expect Washington\u2019s total EBITDA as adjusted will be flat to approximately $5 million lower for the first-half of 2017.","Now to capital markets activity for the quarter. In November, we extended one of our two $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities from June of 2017 to February of 2021 with two six-month extension options. The interest rate on the borrowings under the extended facility was reduced from LIBOR plus 115 basis points to LIBOR plus 100 basis points and a 20 basis point facility fee remains unchanged.","In December, we completed a $400 million refinancing of 350 Park Avenue for a 10-year \u2013 or for 10 years at a fixed rate of 3.92%. We received net proceeds of a $111 million after repaying the 3.75 maturing loan.","Our 2017 maturities are $119 million related to three Washington D.C. properties and $209 million in 2018. Our share of partially owned entities debt maturities in 2017 is $222 million and $46 million in 2018.","Excluding the financing on our 220 Central Park South project, which will self liquidate, as signed contracts close, our consolidated debt metrics are fixed rate debt accounted for 74% of debt with a weighted average rate of 3.82% and a weighted average term of 5.0 years and floating rate debt accounted for 26% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.34% and a weighted average term of 4.7 years. Debt to enterprise value was 24%. Debt net of cash to EBITDA is 5.6 times, including our share of partially owned entities debt other than Toys \"R\" Us debt net of cash to EBITDA is 6.7 times.","After evaluating the effect of our Washington spin, the three rating agencies have reaffirmed our ratings. In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and well staggered debt maturities. We have $4.2 billion in liquidity comprised of $1.8 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $2.4 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Steve.","Steven Roth","Thanks, Steve. Thanks for the last four years. Congratulations on your last Vornado earnings call and get down to Washington and give them hell.","Stephen Theriot","Thank you.","Steven Roth","Cathy.","Cathy Creswell","We\u2019re ready for Q&A at this point.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is Manny Korchman from Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman","Good morning. Steve, just had a question on NAV and sort of the \u2013 you mentioned you\u2019ll be doing this now every year on an annual basis. You had started putting some NAV disclosure over the past couple of NAREITs and the last NAREITs had given a data table or a range of different NAVs. And so I\u2019m just curious on two fronts. One, what is sort of the rationale behind doing it and putting out an actual NAV per share?","And then secondarily, at least, relative to November, it appears as though the NAV per share went up about $7 from, call it, 128 to 135 using the same cap rates on New York in \u2013 and for office and retail. It looks like there\u2019s some adjustment for 666. And I\u2019m just wondering if you can walk through that that increase?","Steven Roth","Well, Michael, good morning. So somebody tell me the different parts of that question. So I can handle it.","Stephen Theriot","Well, the first part was just the rationale and thought behind including this as an annual component at our supplemental?","Steven Roth","Well, the \u2013 there has \u2013 first of all, many of our peers do it. Second of all, all of the analysts have their own NAVs, including you and your sister analysts. So everybody must be making a similar kind of a calculation. Third, many of our investors would like to know what our version of NAV is. So we thought that and we had sort of legged into it.","As you said, over the last six months or nine months at various industry gatherings, we had published NAVs \u2013 partial NAVs, or at least the framework of how you would go about calculating it. So we thought that we had and we had \u2013 we thought that this was an appropriate time to actually sit down and put out a framework for what the NAV is. It is merely a calculation of income at a cap rate.","So the income is absolutely correct and hard number. The cap rate is \u2013 involves some subjective judgment, but you can get pretty close to accuracy, at least, we think we can. So the rationale is other people do it. Our peers do it. Our investors and analysts seem to want it and so there you have it. This is not something \u2013 this is something that moves kind of glacially, so we thought in our counsel room that it was appropriate to publish it once a year. And that that once a year would be in the fourth quarter when we put out our K. And so that\u2019s the cadence that we intend to follow.","With respect to the change between an NAV that from several months ago and today, we didn\u2019t put out an NAV several months ago. So what is Michael \u2013 what\u2019s Michael referring too.","Michael Franco","Yes. Well, what he\u2019s referring to Steve is the data that we did in the NAREIT deck that included certain NAV component information and the approach we\u2019re taking here had some differences to it. The approach here was to do exactly what you said, which was reconcile all the numbers in this schedule back to our published numbers, including a reconciliation on the debt balances.","We had a different logical organization to the NAREIT deck, as it relates to one investment, in particular, 666 Fifth the office piece of that. In that we back out the non-cash EBITDA from that investment in this calculation, and therefore, logically should take the debt associated with that investment out, which we have. That has the effect of being a positive impact on NAV by roughly $3.5 because of the amount of the debt the way the math on that calculation works. So by taking out the roughly $700 million of debt related to that investment.","There were some other logical differences, but that was the biggest one. But this approach though of taking the numbers and reconciling them back to our published results is the approach we intend to take. There were some other offsets driven in part by changes in some of the individual investments and NOI increases from the third quarter to year end that are the difference.","Steven Roth","Damn, you\u2019re a good CFO. Another point that I would make is that, one would hope that the NAV rises, because the main component of it is the income and one hopes that the income building by building rises. So we would expect the NAV to rise each year.","Emmanuel Korchman","Okay.","Steven Roth","Okay, Michael?","Emmanuel Korchman","Yes. The only other follow-up was just on the dividend, you put out a press release a couple of weeks ago, which sort of laid out the various components of your dividend between 220 Central Park South. JBG, or the D.C. portfolio and some gains. And I\u2019m just wondering, how you\u2019re thinking about after 220 sort of stops and that has been sold out. How we should think about that annual dividend? And obviously, there has been good growth in core income, which led to effectively over a 20% increase in that core dividend outside of D.C. and the residential. How should we think about that run rate going into when 220 stops?","Steven Roth","Okay, I got it. So two things. First, normally, we and others put out a dividend press release, it\u2019s two lines. This one was a full page of various explanations, because we thought that that was appropriate and we thought that it was important that we get the disclosure into the market.","So our dividend, it obviously includes JBG Smith that allocable to our Washington assets until the spin. Our dividend always includes a capital gain portion if we have sold the building, or what have you. So the unusual thing about the dividend is an inclusion of a section \u2013 of a segment of the dividend that comes from the 220 Central Park South development.","Now and we thought that it was important to get disclosure into the marketplace as to these facts. So the 220 Central Park South development is for sale condos. That is, as the tax folks call it dealer property, dealer property is subject to a 100 excise tax. And so, therefore, the protocol is that, we and others do that kind of an investment in our taxable REIT subsidiary.","Our taxable REIT subsidiary is basically a shell. It has no employees and it has a very limited balance sheet. So therefore, all of those services would, as you would expect, come from Vornado. Vornado charges the TRS entity, which is the owner of the project, market rates for capital for guarantees and for development fees. Those payments result in a \u2013 an amount of money, which then constitutes taxable income on Vornado\u2019s financials, which is then paid out. So we thought that explaining that to the market was appropriate and we did so.","Cathy Creswell","Okay. Next question.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","James Feldman","Great. Thank you, and good morning. Sticking with, Steve, I was hoping you could discuss your latest thoughts on a succession plan now that the simplification plan is nearing an end with the JBG Smith transition? And then also maybe talk to us about the infrastructure council what your role will be and what it will mean in terms of a time commitment?","Steven Roth","Well, my main thought about succession plan is, I\u2019m absolutely thrilled to get the 71-year old Macnow back into the saddle. So basically, look, we have a very deep management team here. We hate losing Steve. But we are delighted that his talents will go into making us all money at JBG Smith remember that our Vornado shareholders will own 74% of JBG Smith, so it\u2019s a very important investment to it.","Joe, of course, was \u2013 we \u2013 actually I said jokingly over the last four years, it\u2019s actually not a joke, it\u2019s probably more factual that we really had to CFO\u2019s that we did. So now we\u2019re very happy to have Joe back. With respect to me, we have \u2013 our Board, as you would expect, our Board has a robust succession plan if I get hit by a bus and has a robust succession plan when my time has come.","And so when it\u2019s appropriate to announce and to make the transition from me and Joe, I guess, are the two most senior members of our management team. We will tell you then when it\u2019s appropriate. But be assured that if either Joe or I get hit by a bus, this company will not miss a beat.","The second question was about the infrastructure, give me that again, Jamie?","James Feldman","Just the announcement that you\u2019re going to be active on the infrastructure council under \u2013 for President Trump, and what that means in terms of your activity and a time commitment? And how should we think about that compared to your role at Vornado going forward?","Steven Roth","I mean, my role at Vornado is my day job. It\u2019s my night job, It\u2019s my passion. I know President Trump. I know him for a very long time. We have had dealings together. We know each other. I\u2019m honored that he has asked me together with Richard LeFrak to be an advisor to him and the administration with respect to infrastructure matters. Infrastructure matters are not political.","Everybody \u2013 every citizen of America wants interest \u2013 our infrastructure to be robust to be in a good state of repair to be good. So that we can be competitive and we can have the right quality of life, et cetera.","So this is \u2013 I\u2019m honored to be involved in it I think I can contribute. I\u2019m an advisor. I\u2019m not a line executive. I\u2019m not in anyway an employee of the government. And so this is something that we do when asked. Just as we serve on hospital boards or university boards when asked. So that\u2019s it. I will hope that this President, I know this President means business, and I would hope that I and Richard LeFrak can make a difference.","James Feldman","So do you have a sense of just the time commitment? Is it days per week, or is it calls every once in a while, or do you not know yet.?","Steven Roth","The answer is that the time commitment to do this activity on behalf of the United States will not impair my ability to function as the Chief Executive Officer of Vornado. If I have to work a little harder, I surely will.","James Feldman","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Good morning. David, I just wanted to try and expand on some of your comments about the demand that you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. And just try and maybe understand kind of the discussions that you\u2019re having with tenants in the marketplace today about kind of their needs for expansion, new requirements in the marketplace, kind of offset with some of the new supply that\u2019s coming in the city, and kind of rising concession levels? And just trying to really understand when you kind of look at your own portfolio, how much of the downsizing that\u2019s maybe taken place over the last five to seven years, do you think a sort of complete and how much is left to be done?","Steven Roth","Steve, good morning. Listen, I guess, the first thing I would say is, we have an incredibly diverse multi-tenant portfolio. I think, we have somewhere about 1,300 tenants in our portfolio. And even if you look at the largest tenants in our folio, which are listed in the supplement, once you take out of the U.S. government, which obviously is not going to be become part of Vornado once the spin is completed. The top 30 tenants of the company represent less than 25% of revenue.","So I think, the first thing, I\u2019d say is, incredibly diverse portfolio. Second thing, I\u2019d say is, as it relates to the rightsizing, downsizing, and I think I\u2019ve said this in the past. As we look at the financial sector that rightsizing really has taken place as you look back to 2008, as compared to where you are today. So if you take account of the bold banks, their platform back in 2008 was about 45 million square feet, that\u2019s down today to about 32 million square feet.","So I will say most of what we\u2019re seeing these days actually is net expansion. I think I gave you a statistic, which is on a net basis, once you took account of tenants who contracted last year versus tenants who expanded, as it related to all the deals that we did, the 2.2 million square feet, 2.3 million square feet of activity fully 20% of that net was growth in New York.","So I would say, as we look out, the key obviously is job growth. We saw some tempering of that office sector job growth after we went at a blistering pace for the better part of five or six years, if in fact, we do begin to see some greater activity in the financial services in terms of jobs. And as I said anecdotally, we\u2019ve been very busy in that financial services sector over the last really three, four months in some great space in 280 Park, 90 Park, 888 Seventh Avenue.","If we see some growth in the financial services sector, I think, that can have an enormously positive impact on the overall job growth. I think the basic math is to absorb the space that\u2019s coming online over the next couple of years, around numbers we need somewhere around job growth of, call it, 10,000 to 12,000 jobs a year. We went from a pace averaging 35,000 jobs over the last five, six years to obviously a reduced number last year of 5,000. But we continue to see very good demand, and in fact, growth by tenants.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, thanks. And maybe my second question, I don\u2019t know for you, or for Steve. Could you just comment a little bit more about the redevelopment of one and two Penn and through the comments on Farley, and just kind of help us understand sort of the timing and when we may get more details kind of on that sort of project officially kicking off?","Steven Roth","I think with respect to Farley, as I said in my prepared remarks, and I think David said, we\u2019re working hard together with our partners and together with the state who is the seller to close that transaction and get started. The \u2013 so we\u2019re targeting towards a spring to summer closing, and so there you have it. The plans are pretty clear. The public portion, the civic space, the grand Trade Hall are actually pretty amazing. The \u2013 though \u2013 and that will be basically paid for by government and constructed by Skanska.","The \u2013 our portion, which is of 750,000 feet of office space and a couple of thousand square feet of retail will be funded by us and we\u2019re very excited about the space. The location is a bull\u2019s eye. It fits right into our strategy of Penn Plaza, it fits right into our strategy of the west side and the \u2013 it sort of marries up with the siblings, the three developments we now have \u2013 process in West Chelsea. Our partner related, of course, is a natural, because they \u2013 they\u2019re doing all the work immediately west of it.","With respect to one Penn and two Penn, we\u2019re very excited about the prospects of those buildings. We\u2019re very excited about tenant demand and we\u2019re even more excited about the prospects for bringing to market product, which will come in at higher rents. We have nothing specific in terms of budgets, or timing to announce right now about those buildings.","Operator","And next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning. And just two questions here quick. First, Steve, you mentioned, you highlighted theMART, you highlighted 640 Madison has tremendous mark-to-markets. How many buildings do you think you have in the portfolio that have those big mark-to-market, or should we think about it that there are a few of those little gems, but for the most part the portfolio is \u2013 the buildings are pretty much where they should be as far as the right tenants or the right positioning within the market? Just trying to get a sense of how many guess, or 100% type increases there are in the portfolio versus just regular 10%, 15% type spreads in the portfolio.","Steven Roth","Well, first of all, 10%, 15% spreads are pretty good. Second of all, we have been \u2013 we have said repeatedly that we believe one Penn Plaza and two Penn Plaza are assets, which with tender loving care development \u2013 redevelopment, et cetera have enormous financial potential, and we expect to harvest at and our hard work at that. There are other assets in the portfolio that we think have the potential to reward our shareholders, and that\u2019s about as specific as I think I can get out.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, and then \u2013 that\u2019s helpful, Steve. And then the second question is\u2026","Steven Roth","By the way, the month is not done yet by a long shot.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, that\u2019s good. That\u2019s good to hear. The second question is, on the fund, just sort of curious, you said that the Crowne Plaza and the Lincoln Road asset are going to stay as long-term holds. But my understanding is, a fund has a set life and that needs to be harvested. So is Vino going to be buying out its partners in those, or is Vino gotten the partners approval to hang on to those two assets longer?","Steven Roth","Neither of those. What I said was, I did say \u2013 what I said was, we\u2019re going to hold those buildings longer-term, because their business plans are still in process. So the \u2013 we had \u2013 we started out with 12 assets in this entity. We\u2019ve already harvested, or sold six. We have four more on the \u2013 in the queue to be sold, and the two remaining assets will take a little while longer. There was no implication in my remarks that we\u2019re going to buy out partners, or do anything of the sort.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you for that clarification, Steve.","Steven Roth","Thanks for the question. Thanks, Alex.","Operator","And next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Please go ahead.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. First question on the Street retail segment, there has been some talk about rents weakening in parts of Manhattan. Can you remind us where your in place rents are for your portfolio versus market? And then for explorations in coming years, do you still see a positive mark-to-market opportunity for the segment?","Steven Roth","Let\u2019s see. First of all, I have said on the \u2013 on calls for the last year or maybe even longer that retail is soft. It continues to be soft. Rents are not rising asset. And in many instances, rents are falling. And as I\u2019ve said before, we are in the \u2013 we are in the realism business and we will meet the market and rent our space.","Interestingly, if you go back over history and the best couple of years, we made the Victoria\u2019s Secrets deal. We made the Swatch deal at the St. Regis. At our neighbor, Jeff Sutton made the Nike deal, which was a whole drama. All of those \u2013 those three deals were the biggest deals done recently.","They were all with the first digit of a three. There is a slew of other deals on Fifth Avenue, where the first digit is a one, a double-digit number and then there are other deals that were made where the rents were in the 20s. So this market is still location sensitive and the great locations are still in demand by retailers.","Now, having said that, David, do you have any specifics about the response to the next question?","David Greenbaum","The space that \u2013 first of all, the space that we are coming up the balance of this year is, what I\u2019ll call, much closer to commodity retail space than the high ticker space, Steve, that you were talking about in the high-street corridors. We\u2019ve continued to see in Times Square some very good activity at 1535 Broadway. We are working hard in completing a significant lease, which would basically leave us one additional piece of space at 1535. And we have now buttoned up everything that we have on Fifth Avenue with obviously the Dyson\u2019s deal.","So, if Madison Avenue, for example, is soft, we do have a impending vacancy coming up in 2018 in the Westbury Hotel\u2026","Steven Roth","That\u2019s recently\u2026","Joseph Macnow","Oh, yes, and in the Westbury Hotel, that\u2019s a very shallow space. We will cut it up into very small stores and so we\u2019re not concerned about it. And we \u2013 so we think that that will be flat to our \u2013 that will be a flat mark-to-market. We have a nominal piece of space at the quarter of 57th Street at Madison Avenue and Fuller Building 595 Madison, where we have a Coach in the corner and Prada on the store, which is contiguous to the Four Seasons Hotel.","Prada expired at the end of 2016. So we have that space available. Coach chose for marketing reasons and other reasons to relocate the store to Fifth Avenue. So now many people think that that\u2019s a vacancy, it is not a vacancy. We have the high credit coach on the lease for another approximately 10 years.","So from a financial point of view, that\u2019s all fine. And we believe we will have great success in reletting the product store and maybe even recapturing the coach store we will see how it goes. And then, as David said, we have other availabilities that come up here and there. But basically, we\u2019re pretty well buttoned down.","Nick Yulico","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just going back to the commentary earlier by David on better financial sector sentiment in New York since the election. Wondering how you think this could potentially play out in the leasing market since larger banks have mostly committed to space needs in the last several years. Is this more that incremental space needs would come from boutique banks, asset managers, what are your thoughts on that?","Steven Roth","I used to think of boutique banks as having five tenant and 15,000 square feet. And last year, I guess, we completed the transaction with PJT Partners, which obviously is a Blackstone company, Paul Taubman. We\u2019re involved in a discussion right now with another financial services company, which is effectively a new, what I\u2019ll call, FinTech\/trading company that out of the blocks is looking at potentially as much as a 90,000 square feet or 100,000 square feet.","So, the word boutique in the context of the bold bank, which might have a couple of million square feet, these banks in terms of some of the growth that we\u2019re seeing, I think, are still very substantial players.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. It\u2019s helpful.","Steven Roth","I think the amazing thing about New York is the resiliency. So whereas 20 years ago if the financial services industry had a cold, the real estate market was in desperate shape. Today, the real estate market especially in the better buildings, better quality assets is thriving and has grown with all manner of Media Tech and many other kinds of industries taking up the gap.","I can tell you that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace that animal spirits are at play that it has been a longtime since the depths of the great reception. Financial services companies are innovative \u2013 innovating and growing. There\u2019s an enormous amount of liquidity in the world that needs to be invested. And so, we are \u2013 we believe that New York is at the epicenter of all this activity in many different industries, and we\u2019re very, very constructive.","Nick Yulico","Thanks to, everyone.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you very much. First, Steve and Joe, congratulations. It looks like a round trip for Joe.","Steven Roth","Thank you, John.","Joseph Macnow","Thanks, John.","Steven Roth","John, [Multiple Speakers] how this old guy performs.","John Guinee","And now \u2013 he\u2019ll do just fine.","Steven Roth","I\u2019m certain, you\u2019re correct.","John Guinee","Yes, Joe, Steven mentioned that the JBG spin is going to provide daylight to a treasure trove of New York City value, not to really why it takes the spin to do this, but can you kind of tell us, I\u2019m looking specifically page 39 of your supplemental, which talks about $5 billion or $6 billion worth of development \u2013 a redevelopment on one page. How you\u2019re going to upgrade the disclosure and help provide more daylight to this treasure trove?","Joseph Macnow","Yes, we\u2019re sitting here with speechless.","John Guinee","I\u2019ve answered the question, you doesn\u2019t need to be answered.","Joseph Macnow","Well, the first thing is that the investors from an award focused companies investors reward companies that are simpler that have a business plan that is understandable and executable and that have management that is laser like focus on a simple business. So we believe that our stock price is no secret that we were not happy with our stock prices.","So we set about a program a few years ago to fix that by doing what we thought was the right thing, which was simplifying the business and separating the business into a couple of different segments actually three now \u2013 three separate companies, UE, Urban Edge and what we call RemainCo. So that investors could make their own decisions about each of those and we had really, really talented world-class management teams focused on those three separate businesses and we think we\u2019ve accomplished that.","Now, with respect to page 39, I mean, we have in process the developments that are listed there. The 220 and the three Chelsea assets, there is one asset that\u2019s not shown there, which is 260 Eleventh Avenue, which is a great asset that will be \u2013 that we\u2019re designing now and will be a 300,000 square foot closed plus creative asset on 26 Street and 27 Street on Eleventh Avenue, we think that\u2019s great.","And then in the Penn Plaza district, we intend to and aspire to do an enormous amount of activity, which we think will be great and will be financially rewarding to our investors. So that\u2019s the story.","John Guinee","Okay.","Joseph Macnow","By the by we don\u2019t stop there. We\u2019re in the market every day to continue to invest and continue to grow and we have the balance sheet that\u2019s built for growth.","John Guinee","Okay. Second question reference to JBG having the ability to be very, very fast growing maybe the fastest growing in the country. So as we all know in D.C. as is bouncing along the bottom at best and usually REIT stocks do well and there\u2019s a perception of great internal growth, which leads to high multiples, low NAVs, leads to high stock price and low cost to capital, how does JBG come out of the box with a low-cost of capital, given the underlying fairly weak fundamentals in the greater D.C. marketplace?","Steven Roth","John, there\u2019s two parts of that question. And the JBG management team will handle all of that in short order. But let me give you my version of it. Number one, JBG has $23 million \u2013 23 million square feet of density of development rights in their portfolio that they will own at launch in all the best submarkets. So JBG. has its growth all set out for it in land, which will stand to double the size of its portfolio.","So without doing a single external acquisition, this business can double and we are planning for it to double in seven, eight, nine years from internal growth from development on land sites that it already owns, okay. So we think that\u2019s extraordinary and the sites are just incredible.","Now, with respect to your comment about the what\u2019s going on in the D.C. market, obviously, office development in D.C. is somewhat challenged because of demand, et cetera. So \u2013 and while there are a decent number of office sites in there, for example, 700 M Street and there\u2019s many others, most of this 20-million-odd feet of development will be skewed towards apartments.","Apartments are easier to develop. They rent better. They have a perfect elasticity of demand. They finance better and they create extraordinary values. So you can expect that over time, JBG will become the probably the most active residential developer in the city and surrounds and will do unbelievably modern perfectly designed product that we are very excited about.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you.","Steven Roth","Now one last thing with respect to the cost of capital. Our job in launching JBG is to launch it, so that it is absolutely dressed for success. So we will launch JBG as we did with UE and as we run our own Vornado business with a balance sheet, which has the capital in place to accomplish its business plan, which is basically to perform that development that we just talked about over a finite and predictable period of time.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you.","Operator","There\u2019s time for one additional question. Manny Korchman from Citi is on line for the final question please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman","Hi, guys, thanks for taking the follow-up. Steve, you talked about liquidity for the opportunity set that\u2019s out there in the past you\u2019ve talked about targeting sort of a $2 billion cash balance on the balance sheet. It looks like you\u2019re dipping below that, and I assume that there will be some amount of cash that will also go with the JBG spin. So A, could you help us figure out how much cash might go to JBG? And Billion, how should we think about the cash balance on the balance sheet going forward here?","Steven Roth","My departing CFO says that, by the way, I guess, we call you now that CFO, Joe, the CFO-elect, what are you?","Joseph Macnow","The designate.","Steven Roth","So anyway. So we have $1.8 billion in cash in marketable securities, et cetera, on the balance sheet today. The $2 billion was not a red line in the sand. It\u2019s just that \u2013 it\u2019s a target. We could liquefy and add another hugely significant amount of cash at any time we wanted to. But there\u2019s no purpose of that. So we\u2019re loaded and we\u2019re happy with where we are and it\u2019s going to fluctuate a little bit and that\u2019s okay.","With respect to how much cash we are going to see JBG Smith with? The first thing to notice is that that we have seeded it with the \u2013 with all of our Washington assets. One of which is very interesting. It\u2019s the Bartlett, which is a $400 million plus asset, which is free and clear.","So the first move of the NewCo JBG Smith will be to finance that. And so that will produce a pile of cash well over $200 million. We and the JBG funds will seed it with cash. We are not announcing that number. That number will be announced when we get closer to the launch.","And there are other financial arrangements that we will be making, so that JBG Smith has the and I said this repeatedly, I\u2019ll say it again, because it bears repeating again. We\u2019ll have the balance sheet, so that it \u2013 so that investors will understand, it has the capital in hand, in place to accomplish its business plan.","Emmanuel Korchman","Thanks. And while I\u2019ve got two CFOs in the room there, just going back to the NAV analysis that you presented. Just quick question on 555 cal, why was that sort of presented within NOI and a value, but no matching cap rate, is that\u2019s just \u2013 is cap rate the wrong way to think about that asset\u2026","Steven Roth","It\u2019s not \u2013 the asset is not stabilized, because there are the Cube and several other vacancies in the building. So we thought that it was a more appropriate. We used a $1,000 a foot as a rule of thumb and we used that. So that obviously, it\u2019s not a cap rate metric, it\u2019s a tonnage metric.","Emmanuel Korchman","The incremental revenue that you guys have been talking about in the past $114 million left, how much of that comes on in 2017 and 2018 and thereafter?","Joseph Macnow","It\u2019s all by first quarter, second quarter of 2018, most of in 2017, a small residual in 2018.","Emmanuel Korchman","And Steve final one for you, would you be willing to share \u2013 update a condo sells for 220 Central Park South?","Steven Roth","As a policy, we have not done that for competitive reasons. We have just \u2013 we have said to the marketplace before, we\u2019ll say it again. We have \u2013 sales are fine. Actually they\u2019re extraordinary. The pricing is extraordinary and we have \u2013 the sales to-date exceed our cost.","Emmanuel Korchman","All right. Thank you very much.","Steven Roth","Thank you. One more question please.","Operator","We have Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","James Feldman","Great, thanks. Good, thanks for taking that. Just a quick follow-up. So just going back to Michael\u2019s comment about high demand from foreign buyers for Vornado assets specifically, can you talk maybe talk more about what you meant and can we see more of a ramp up in asset sales here?","Michael Franco","I\u2019ll take the first part of that. On foreign demand like we can judge not only by the actual activity that\u2019s occurred and what the source of that activity is over the last year or so and even beyond that, but also the income as we get interested in investing in New York.","So the range of players continues to expand. There are many countries with sovereign wealth funds that are new or newish that are either not yet invested in New York, or barely invested with a huge desire to ramp that up. So I think, as we look at in totality all the Canadians have been active for a while. And so the Middle Eastern players and the Chinese are newer, we\u2019re still really at the infancy in the overall trend with quite a number of new players they want to be here.","In terms of asset sales, I think at this point anything we do comes from a position of offence, and I think would be more along the lines of a cap of a recycling upgrading, which we\u2019ve done a very good job of and it\u2019s a right time. There may be a couple of others that make sense to do that with, but nothing that\u2019s imminent.","James Feldman","Okay. Thanks for taking my question.","Cathy Creswell","Thank you.","Steven Roth","Thanks, everybody. That concludes the call. We\u2019ll see you next quarter. We\u2019re very excited about where we are. We\u2019re very excited about JBG Smith. We\u2019re very excited about Joe Macnow. We sort of just about ready to start forgetting Steve Theriot. And I wish thank you all. Enjoy Valentine\u2019s Day, don\u2019t forget, and we\u2019ll see you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions].","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Cathy Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s second quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our second quarter earnings release and filed our Annual Report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","These documents as well as our supplemental financial information package are available on our website, www.vno.com under the Investor Relations section. In these documents and during today\u2019s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, Form 10-Q and financial supplement.","Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

Also in the room is Michael Franco, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer. ","I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thanks, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado\u2019s second quarter 2017 call. ","I'm going to start with the numbers. Our total FFO for the quarter was $1.35 per share compared to $1.21 per share in last year's comparable quarter at 11.6% increase. FFO as adjusted for comparability for the quarter was $1.25 per share compared to a $1.19 per share last year a 5% increase. ","Focusing on Vornado RemainCo, our go forward company which excludes Washington, second quarter FFO as adjusted was $0.97 per share compared to $0.92 per share last year a 5.4% increase. This information is shown in our financial supplement on Page 11. ","We run the business focusing on cash metrics; real estate is bought and sold on cash numbers. Vornado RemainCo cash basis FFO as adjusted was $0.85 per share for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $0.67 per share in the prior year, a super strong 26.9% increase. Reconciliations of total FFO to FFO as adjusted can be found in our earnings release and in our Form 10-Q. ","One of our primary objectives of simplifying and focusing our business over the past several years was the daylight Vornado RemainCo's remain outstanding financial performance. We've gone back and isolated what would have been Vornado RemainCo's financial performance as a standalone company from 2009 through 2016 that math shows our FFO as adjusted per share grew by an industry leading and very strong 15% CAGR. ","A short comment on our same-store results. Both the New York segment and the March same-store EBITDA were negative quarter-over-quarter, both would have been positive, but for a couple of one-timers, excluding those one-timers New York segment same-store EBITDA was positive 40 basis points and same-store NOI was a very strong positive 11.7%. ","The March same store EBITDA would have been positive 4% and same store NOI would have been positive 6.5%. ","Two weeks ago, on July 7, we completed the separation, -- July 17, we completed the separation of our Washington DC business and simultaneous merger with JBG Smith to form JBG Smith properties which now trades on the New York Stock Exchange as an independent public company, under the ticker symbol JBGS. ","We have now created three highly focused best-in-class pure play publicly traded REITS, Vornado RemainCo, JBG Smith Properties and Urban Edge Properties, each with its own best-in-class focused management and separate stock price and each is the leader in its market. ","Urban Edge, under the leadership of Jeff Olsen, and Bob Minutoli continues to perform at the top of its competitive shift. A shout and Vornado\u2019s thanks to Mitchell and all of our Washington alumni for the work that they have done for us over these many years. ","I can\u2019t resist the plug for JBG Smith, our new born. As you get to know the team I am certain you will agree with me that they are the best in the business and they are playing to win. As I had said before I expect JBG Smith to be the fastest grower in all of REIT land, as it builds out its 18 million square feet of development rights it will more than double in size, all of these land is already owned, it is free and clear, it is entitled and it is the best sites in the best sub markets in the Washington region. ","Think about it, development yields are much higher than acquisition yields and the vast majority of this development will be state-of-the art brand spanking new apartments, highly amenitized and the most competitive project in each sub market and that\u2019s exactly the product we want to own. ","A real-time example is The Bartlett our 700 unit highly amenitized residential project in Pentagon City which opened a year ago. This project rented up in a year versus our budget of 30 months and had better than pro forma financial results. The Bartlett is now the gold standard in the region. JBG Smith has two adjacent sites for another 1,400 units. The point of this being that modern design and new product wins the race. ","Over the last few years we had done a good job cleaning house, and we continue to advance the ball on that front. Since last quarter we exited two non-core investments. In May, a joint venture in which we have a 21.1% equity interest sold the Suffolk balance race track in Boston, from the property sale and from loan repayment we realized cash proceeds of $50.8 million and recognized a book gain of $26.7 million.","Next, we are totally existing our investments in India which were acquired between 2005 and 2008. The exit will be completed in three separate transactions two of which have already closed and the third is under contract, with two buyers, one of whom was our partner. We realized cash proceeds of $43.7 million year and no book gain. You should know that both of these investments were the subject of impairments in prior years. ","David will handle operations and I will give you a brief overview here. New York office leased 543,000 square feet, 402,000 square feet a share in the quarter with average starting rents of $79.50 and positive mark to markets of 17.8% GAAP and 13.7% cash. Occupancy was a full 96.7% same as first quarter. ","Demand for office space in New York is robust coming from all manner of users. Our New York buildings are well positioned after having completing over the last four years a string of major building redevelopments covering six buildings and 6.5 million square feet ensuring our assets remain up to date and to attract tenants from all market segments. ","I coin the phrase the island of Manhattan is jumping to to the west and to the south. Today the [indiscernible] market's in town run from Hudson Yards to Penn Plaza and extent south through Chelsea and Meatpacking. It is important to note that anticipating these trends, we have structured our portfolio so that almost half of our square footage is in this hottest district. ","In an important and highly publicized deal on June 28, Aetna announced that it is relocating its headquarters from Hartford, Connecticut to New York at our 61 Ninth Avenue in the heart of the Meatpacking sub market. Aetna is leasing the 142,000-square foot component of this new build at a triple digit rent which interestingly is higher than prior mid-town [ph] would command. Aetna is an insurance giant that is on the go and they are located in the heart of New York's created district. The stabilized GAAP yield on this project will be 9% and the first stabilized year cash yield will be 8.1%. ","Starbucks 23,000 roastery will begin tenant work in October and that they will begin tenant work in April 2018. We believe this deal reinforces New York as the headquarters town and as the talent hub and validates real estate as a recruiting tool. David will have more to say about this deal in a minute. ","In this hottest district, in addition to our 9 million square feet at Penn Plaza we have 85 Tenth Avenue and under construction in addition to 61 Ninth we have 512 West 22nd Street, 260 Eleventh Avenue, 606 Broadway and of course the Farley Post Office Building. ","In our New York street retail business, we leased 24,000 square feet in five deals, 19,000 square feet a share with positive mark to markets of 34.9% GAAP and 24.8% cash. Occupancy was 95.3% the same as the first quarter. In my annual letter to shareholders on Page 15 through 17, I layout my views on retail and general and our retail business in particular including cash NOI guidance, I reaffirm that guidance today. ","After quarter end in July, we signed 16,000 square foot lease with Safora, at our 1535 Broadway in Times Square where we owned the two best fronts on both of side of the building. This store will be Safora's largest in the U.S. and will replace their existing store across the street which we understand is their highest grossing in the U.S. In the quarter, we signed a 10,000-square foot lease for an Amazon bookstore at our 3040-end street in George Town, Amazon replaces Barney's here at a positive mark-to-market of 43.2% cash and 61.1% GAAP. We owned two of Amazon's eight book stores, the second being at our 7 West 34th street. ","I'll repeat what I said on last quarter's call. Our Upper Fifth Avenue and Times Square retail assets with a majority of our retail value is a buttoned up for term with great tenants and great credits. These are great assets, they are unique, extremely scarce, irreplaceable and the highest quality in the world. Here is an interesting fact for you, in all of our Fifth Avenue and Times Square properties, the only lease expiry in the next five years is the Massimo Dutti store, a Zara division, at our 689 Fifth Avenue which expires in mid-2019 and is substantially below market.","We hosted and invited two of our 220 Central Park South luxury condominium projects site back in June which many of you attended. 220 Central Park South is head and shoulders the market leader. Construction and sales continue above plan.","Now turning to the investment and financing markets. Investment sales activity in the first half has slowed appreciatively, a victim of caution and uncertainty and the fact that not a lot of good product has been put up for sale. Without a lot of data points, I would say that the highest quality trophy assets are still commanding top pricing and lower quality assets are down a tick or two or maybe three. ","The most interesting recent data point is in London where the iconic Walkie Talkie building designed by Rafael Vi\u00f1oly who also design 61 Ninth Avenue for us sold at a 3.4% cap rate, $2,500 per square feet to a Hong Kong industrial company. This was a $1.5 billion deal. Another data point, a store on Madison Avenue with seven years left to run on at least to a top luxury tenant is in the bidding tents and we are told is attracting sub 4% bids are above market rents.","Debt market for New York assets are as liquid and strong as we have even seen. In the past few months there have been over $7 billion of New York City financings completed in just 10 deals at very attractive rates on high quality commercial assets three of which were ours. Given the relative strength in the debt markets, many owners are choosing to refinance rather than to sell.","In conclusion, we will continue our value creation efforts, our top priority is of course with Penn Plaza. Now to David.","David Greenbaum","Good morning everyone. With Steve having covered our basis leasing metrics to the quarter this morning I'm going to spend a few minutes on the market and then add a bit more color on our second quarter activity.","In our first quarter call, I pointed you to the revised BLS Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs numbers showing that office using employment in 2016 grew by 33,000 jobs. That was well in excess of the annual rate of job growth of some 10 to 15,000 jobs needed to observe the new supply coming online over the next five years. Half way through 2017, the city already has added over 15,000 office using jobs while timely employment is down slightly year-to-date, the financial services industry has been the key driver of office sector jobs adding 7,000 jobs during the first half of the year with financial services employment back now at its highest level since September 2001.","[Indiscernible] mid-sector has already translated into an increase in leasing activity of our financial related firms, accounting for a third full year third of all new leasing activities city wide. ","This is just the latest indicator of the resilience of our New York City economy. The city controller recently issued report highlighting the fact that New York City\u2019s recovery from the great recession a decade ago was both significantly faster and significantly stronger than the national recovery. From 2007 to 2016, New York City total employment grew 13.9% well above the 4.6% national growth rate. Unemployment in New York is now harboring at record lows of 4.3%.","The health of our job market is reflected in overall market leasing statistics. With 9.8 million square feet leased in the second quarter and 20.8 million square feet leased year-to-date in this city, the market in on track to approach the record leasing year of 2014 and city wide 42 million square feet of leases were completed. ","While a number of significant large leases above 250,000 square feet has helped drive the market, leasing activity in the 25,000 to 100,000 square foot range also has remained very strong, it's that mid-market which represents the sweet spot of our diverse multi-tenant portfolio and continuing leasing trends deal making in the city also was concentrated in new bills and renovated properties right in the sweet spot of our portfolio which is in great shape. ","Overall for the quarter the vacancy rate in Manhattan improved by 20 basis points to 9.2% while net absorption was positive at about 700,000 square feet. ","The recent CBRE report provides a helpful way of looking at the health of the market. On a year-to-date basis, they look at real growth in this city, new leases and expansions net of contractions, across 12 industries CBRE so our net growth totaling 3.3 million square feet. This is the same metric that we have been tracking in our own portfolio on a quarterly basis. ","For our owned portfolio in the last 10 quarters dating back to the start of 2015 we have leased a total of more than 5.6 million square feet of which 1.5 million square feet fully 27% has been net new or expansion space real, real growth to this city. ","Let me now turn to our portfolio for the quarter, where business remains very good. First, we are full with occupancy at 96.7%. Average starting rents for the quarter were $79.50 on 543,000 square feet of leasing activity representing strong mark-to-market of 17.8% gap and 13.7% cash. Almost a quarter of activity were 130,000 square feet was in Penn Plaza where average starting rents exceeded $65 a foot. ","Renewals dominated our leasing in the second quarter and as a result average GIs at $34.11 per square foot, fell dramatically from the first quarter when new and expansion space was a much more significant share of our activity. ","And we had continued to outperform at the high end of the market, with more than a third of our leasing activity at over $100 per square foot across four different buildings, including 90 Park Avenue, 280 Park Avenue, 888 Seventh Avenue and our newest trophy building 61 Ninth Avenue. ","Last quarter I spoke to you about Glen Cove's relocation of its headquarters from Stanford to our 330 Madison Avenue. A reversal of the outward migration of financial services jobs to Connecticut which took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This quarter that trend continues with Aetna's relocation to the Meatpacking district. As Steve told you the story of 61 Ninth Avenue is one of perfect execution and I am enormously proud of our acquisition, development, marketing, leasing and construction teams. ","We previously told you that this building in the heart of the Meatpacking West Chelsea district at 15th street and Ninth Avenue, what is main and main in the new world economy will be a trophy asset of the future and the 142,000 square foot Aetna headquarters lease and the 23,000-square foot Stark Bucks roastery confirm that characterization. ","Next up is 512 West 22nd street another architectural distinctive building with outdoor green space on every floor right on the high line. The high net will be 606 Broadway, another new build at the entrance to SoHo and then 260 11th Avenue for we will transform the Otis Elevator building into a best in class marriage of historic space with distinctive modern features. And of course, as Steve mentioned during the second quarter, we unrelated closed our acquisition of a 99-year lease on the Farley building, a totally unique horizontal campus which will offer 730,000 square feet of best in class creative office space on unmatched floor plates in Penn Plaza with its unraveled transit access plus an additional 120,000 square feet of ancillary train hold retail. ","You can see early progress at the Farley building, where a stayed effort has produced 2 grand Eighth Avenue entrances at 31 and 33rd Street both of which take you down to an expanded and renovated west end concourse of Penn station. All of these buildings are perfectly positioned to meet the needs of a millennial talent that employers today seek as well as what is now going to be called generation Z, the name demographers have established for the post-millennial generation which is now entering the labor pool. ","At one time, the competition for young talent was synonymous with [indiscernible] tenants, software companies, advertising firms etcetera. But now when it comes to pursuing talent, the so called new and old industries are converging on a same group of people with important implications for the office market. Aetna, the prototypical insurance company was founded in the mid-19th century and headquartered throughout its storied history in Hartford. Aetna is now coming to the Meatpacking district because it is competing for programmers, designers and other talent what I call intellectual capital with the Googles and Facebooks of the world. ","We've seen the same phenomenon in Chicago, where companies such as Allstate, Caterpillar and Canagra have moved to the mark in part to rebrand themselves to recruit the best potential employees. As these old and new companies fight for the same talent pool, so too are they increasingly pursuing the same real estate. And we are perfectly positioned within our own portfolio to capitalize on this trend.","Overall our remaining 2017 office lease expirations are now down to just 115,000 square feet, while our 2018 expirations are modest at just over a million square feet. Glen and his leasing team are active as always with a pipeline of 925,000 square feet of which 475,000 square feet is in lease negotiation.","Turning briefly to our irreplaceable street retail business, Steve already told you about the leases we entered into with Amazon Books in Georgetown and our flagship lease with Sephora in 1535 Broadway, at the heart of the [indiscernible] in Times Square just completed last week after the end of the quarter. I'll also add that Amazon is well advanced in the buildout of its new book store at our 7 West 34th Street.","Turning now to theMart in Chicago, it was a quite quarter with no new office leases, not especially surprising when you consider that the building is almost 99% leased. We did enter into over 90,000 square feet of showroom leases representing mark-to-markets of 10.8% GAAP and 3.3% cash. As always, we invite you to let us know if you have plans to be in Chicago and would like to tour this flagship asset, and be sure to grab a meal or a drink at the new Martian's Landing restaurant and bar now open at the top of our grand stair.","At our trophy San Francisco asset 555 California Street, we signed one lease with Yahoo RemainCo that holds shares in Alibaba. Having recently completed and a modernization and the adjacent historic 315 Montgomery Street we now have two leases out for five full floors of that building totaling 60,000 square feet. We also are moving forward with a total redevelopment of the former Bank of America, banking hold we call the cube and expect to have our improvers in place by the end of this year to commence the redevelopment in 2018. We are very excited about our design for this unique space and are confident and we will attract yet another brand name tenant to our already blue-chip roster.","Let me conclude by saying that we continue to see the New York City economy firing on all cylinders and the fundamentals point to continued growth. Our portfolio is in great shape and we remain strong. With the completion of the DC spin all of us look forward to turning our full attention to continued value creation in our New York portfolio.","Thank you, and with that I'll turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph Macnow","Thank you, David. Good morning everyone. Steve covered our FFO performance in his opening remarks. I will pick up with our EBITDA and NOI results for the quarter. Our New York segments EBITDA increased by 5 million comprised of a non-same store increase of 7 million partially offset by a same store EBITDA decrease of 1.5 million or 50 basis points. And non-same store increase was driven by 7.6 million of straight line rent write-offs in the prior year's second quarter and $4.3 million of EBITDA from 85 Tenth Avenue this year which was included in the other segment in the prior year partially offset by lower income from properties previously taken out of service and lower lease termination fee income. ","New York segment same-store EBITDA decrease of $1.5 million was due to $2.6 million of one-time prior period tenant adjustments and scheduled vacancies of U.S. customs at and Prada at 595 Madison Avenue. Excluding the tenant adjustments, same-store EBITDA grew by 40 basis points. As expected our New York segment second quarter same-store NOI increased by a very strong 10.6% or 11.7% excluding the tenant adjustments over the prior year's second quarter, as the leasing activity we have accomplished over the past few years continues to turn in to long time cash paying tenants. ","The March same store EBITDA decreased by 4.5% and same store NOI decreased by 2.8% both due to the reversal of a $2.3 million accrual for an expense in the prior year's second quarter. Excluding this reversal, the March same store EBITDA continued its strong growth and increased by 4% and same store NOI increased by 6.5%. ","555 California Street same store EBITDA decreased by 2.9% and same store NOI increased by 33.7% and free rent from new leases - Our recently spun-off Washington business had another good quarter with $57 million of comparable FFO as compared to $54.3 million in the prior year's second quarter. ","Washington business EBITDA as adjusted was a $140.9 million for the first six month of this year ahead of the guys we set and ahead of last year. On pages 11 and 12 of our financial supplement we have broken out Washington\u2019s net income, EBITDA and FFO from total company to assist you in understanding, RemainCo going forward. ","Beginning in the third quarter, Washington will be reclassified to discontinued operations and its financial results will be treated as non-comparable and the calculation of FFO as adjusted.","Now to financing activity. In June, we completed a $220 million financing of theMart with a 699-unit residential building with a 39,000-square foot, Whole Foods at its base, located in Arlington Virginia. The five-year interest only loan is at LIBOR plus 170 basis points and matures in June 2022. ","On July 17 the property, the loan and the $217 million of net proceeds will translate to JBG Smith in connection with the spin-off. In June, Alexander\u2019s in which we own a 32.4% completed a $500 million refinancing of the office portion of 731 Lexington Avenue. The interest only loan is at LIBOR plus 90 basis points which was 2.06% at June 30, and matures in June 2024 fully extended. The property was previously incumbered by a $300 million interest only mortgage at LIBOR plus 95 basis points. ","In July, our 25% owned joint ventures that owns 330 Madison Avenue and 845,000 square foot Manhattan office building completed a $500 million refinancing. The seven-year interest year loan matures in August 2024 and has a fixed rate of 3.425%. The property was previously incumbered by a $150 million mortgage at a LIBOR plus 1.30%. We realized net proceeds of approximately 85 million after repayment of the existing loan and closing course. ","Vornado RemainCo has no remaining 2017 consolidated debt or partially owned entity debt maturities. 2018 consolidated net debt maturities are 140.2 million and have our share of partially owned entities 2018 maturities is 443.9 million which includes 275.6 million at share for Independence Plaza, a three tower 327-unit residential complex in Tribeca in which we own a 50.1% interest. ","Excluding the financing on our 220 Central Park South Project which will self-liquidate as signed contracts close, RemainCo's consolidated debt metrics are fixed rate debt account 78% of debt with a weighted average of 3.65% and a weighted average term of 4.4 years and floating rate account for 22% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.9% and a weighted average term of 3.8 years.","Debt to enterprise value was 25.2% based on last night's closing stock price, debt net of cash to EBITDA is 6.1 times, including our share of partially owned entities debt other than 666 Fifth Avenue office and Toys \"R\" Us, debt net of cash to EBITDA is 6.9 times.","In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and well staggered debt maturities. Post to JBJS spin-off we have 3.8 billion in liquidity comprised of 1.3 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and our undrawn 2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. ","I will now turn the call back over to Steve.","Cathy Creswell","We're ready for Q&A at this point Christian. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from James Feldman from Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","James Feldman ","David, we appreciate all the commentary on the leasing market, can you talk more specifically about conversations you're having for the Farley building and then even may be Hotel Penn, given it has been in the press lately.","David Greenbaum","We're not going to make comments about the hotel but, as it relates to the Farley building while it is very, very early days and we have just begun to introduce this building to the marketplace, the receptivity for this type of what I would call horizontal campus, we have found a unique, unique space. I'll say to you there are already are at least two tenants who have indicated an interest to take down the entire asset, and there are additional tenants that we are talking to who have very real interest in this redevelopment.","James Feldman ","And then what's realistic in terms of how soon a tenant can be in there and generating earnings?","David Greenbaum","What we said to you on our last call is that we would be in a position to deliver space to a tenant in the late 2019, early 2020 period of time for the tenant's build out with the tenant who be in position some time in mid to late 2020 period of time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Emmy Korchman from Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman","Steve maybe thinking a longer-term strategy posed for JBG spin and the Urban Edge spins, how do you now feel about the business RemainCo served both growth and maybe shrinking the business through either additional spends or sales of certain assets or certain businesses or somewhere in between?","Steven Roth","I mean look we are on a path where we have said no stone will be left on turn to create value. We have turned over a lot of stones in the last couple of years with asset sales, spins, multiple spins et cetera. We continue to have shareholder value creation as our -- we worship to the god of shareholder value creation. That\u2019s sort of live with what we have done to date, JBG spin was just completed a couple of weeks ago. And that sort of length that seasoned just a little bit and [indiscernible] see how everything reacts and then we will continue. We are interested in growing and acquiring assets at the right price, in our market area. And we continue to think that -- I'm not ready to predict what we may or may not do in the future in terms of value creation, I can only tell you that it continues to be topic number on our mind.","Emmanuel Korchman","Hey Steve its Michael, filling in here with Manny. Question on certain retail, there is a lot of commentary and a lot of press on the retail environment, certainly anything drive up Madison and Fifth and fleet increase and increasing vacancies so I guess how do you buttoned up your portfolio? I'm curious how you feel about the overall environment, just with retail New York right now.","Steven Roth","My feeling is the same and I have been singing this tune for years now. America, the country is vastly over stored. I think I said in my letter that growth will not solve this problem, there has to be an evaporation of a great -- of a great of a lot of space, to get back into some of kind of equilibrium or some of kind of balance. And if the test, the operators, the retailers are struggling which of course puts pressure on their vendors and real estate is, but a vendor to retail community. ","The street retail business in New York continues to be soft, I said that for many, many quarters now. My belief is that the softness in New York is cyclical whereas the softness generally in retail is secular. ","Having said that we anticipated these trends, we've buttoned up our portfolio, we are largely under leased very good high-quality tenants with great credits. So, in terms of our income stream we are -- we feel very, very good about it and very secure. When our tenants however don\u2019t do the kind of business that they think that they should be doing, we are not happy about that either. But in terms of our portfolio we are largely buttoned up, we have been very transparent about that and we feel very secure about our portfolio. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Simone from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Robert Simone","Hey guys thanks for taking the question. Just a follow up on the retail portfolio, I know in the prepared remarks it sounds like the upper fit portfolio there aren\u2019t any major expirations until 2019, but you do have about 11% of your rent expiring next year, so I was just wondering if you guys can provide any sense of what the mark-to-market would be on that? And then I had a follow up.","Steven Roth","I don\u2019t have that list right in front of me, but my guess is -- does anybody have it here? We are looking that up. ","Robert Simone","Thanks Steve. ","Steven Roth","Hang on, its working over here slowly. So, slide number one is, we think that a lot of that space is going to renew and stay and if that happens we would anticipate that it would stay at the same rent or at a gradual uptick in rent. We have a couple of tenants that are vacating which we expect will have a roll down in rent. ","Nonetheless the total portfolio with step ups et cetera, we think will continue to and with new leases coming on board we think will continue to have increased total retail rents, so let me say that again. Most of the tenants that expire next year we think will extend and say and renew. Some will leave and we will spring up a few vacancies there which is natural, that\u2019s our business, people come and people go. ","On the whole, we think that the momentum, the increasing rent momentum in the total portfolio will mean that we will continue to have what we projected in my letter in terms of NOI coming out of the portfolio. ","Robert Simone","Great, thanks Steve, that\u2019s really helpful. And then my follow up, I know you guys provide, a quarterly update on the incremental cash NOI that you expect to roll in and on last count it looks like it's about a 117 million over call to next year and a half. I guess my question is how much of that is currently free rent but included in GAAP?","Steven Roth","That one's over my head, Joe?","Joseph Macnow","Hi, if you recall back in May of 2016 on our first quarter conference call, when we first bought out this concept, we said that there was 200 million that Steve said in his prepared remarks that it was 200 million plus of incremental additive cash NOI on deck, not yet in our numbers which we will recognize between now and 2018. He said 41 million was in '16, 120 million was in '17 and 39 million in '18. In that same prepared remarks and in Q&A we said that the GAAP equivalent was 83 million of which 52 million was in 2016 and 31 million was in 2017. I don\u2019t have the update of what the 117 is but that will give you magnitude of the delta. [Multiple Speakers] with how much of the 117 is not in EBITDA. ","Robert Simone","Sure, that\u2019s helpful. I can follow up with you guys offline if there are any updates. But thanks a lot guys. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Vikram Malhotra","Just for the following up on street retail, have you seen any evidence or can you share any color on asset pricing whether its cap rates or dollar per foot across submarkets?","Steven Roth","What was the question again Vikram?","Vikram Malhotra","Just like pricing for assets for transactions on either cap rate basis or a dollar per foot basis, just given all the weakness we've heard about, I'm just wondering have you actually seen cap rates move the other way in for street retail?","Steven Roth","What we've seen and there are very few data points on this, what we\u2019ve seen is that great assets which are under leased for 7, 8, 9 years or longer but not two or three years are still commanding sub 4% cap rates if they are great assets in great locations. And there are all manner of buyers bidding for those kinds of assets with a great deal of offshore money looking to invest on the great streets of New York, I'm not telling about the fifth Avenues and the Madison Avenues, the famous great streets. Secondary assets or assets which have a vacancy or are not leased for term are struggling to get bids. ","Vikram Malhotra","Okay that makes sense and just from turning to the office site, again sticking to transactions, I know you said for a while that obviously pricing has been elevated. I'm wondering what level of change in asset pricing would sort of make you come back to the market. ","Steven Roth","Let me talk about pricing, what I've said is, is that pricing is high for us to buy because we're an operator, we\u2019re so to speak a dealer, we're a professional, we\u2019re not into that. So, there are two different markets. There are markets for people who are in the real estate business to create value and develop and redevelop and rent and re-rent et cetera which is what we do. And so, we love to buy assets which are complicated, sort of have some hair on them where we can buy them at a good price and create value. That\u2019s our business. With respect to -- but there is another business which is for investors, to buy assets and generally speaking they like to buy assets which are fully stabilized, in perfect condition with long term leases where all of the work has been done. So, there is two different markets. So, we need to buy assets where we can increase values and make money for our shareholders as opposed to investors. So just because I am complaining that it is a dearth of opportunity that doesn\u2019t mean that I think that asset prices for trophy perfectly rented assets which are what investors really seek are going to decline.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","Seems in DC is a JBG Smith will be primarily an apartment developer after 20000 units at 18 million square feet. I'm not sure if that\u2019s because of the strength of the apartment market or the weakness of the DC office market. But we know that you have not really made an effort to be big in the Manhattan apartment market. Any thoughts on that?","Steven Roth","I love the Manhattan apartment markets. And maybe we should have loved it and gotten into it 15 years ago. There has not really been a decent entry point in recent memory, apartments are scarce, they are expensive, I mean they sell for sub 4% cap rates. Having said that we have chosen to put a big toe or maybe our little toe into the market by buying controlled departments where we can get the assets the principal one being IP down in Tribeca, which is a 1,400-unit project et cetera that we own 50% of, where we were able to buy the assets at probably 50% or maybe even 40% of replacement cause. So that\u2019s been our strategy -- and we have two to three of those deals that we own. So, the answer is I love the apartment market and we would like to get into it. It's difficult to get into because it's very, very, very -- its very dear right now. So, the answer is we can't predict the future, but the apartment market is a very, very robust market in Manhattan.","John Guinee","And then the second question I think for Joe, you had a prior CFO there who talked a lot about rescanning one of the 10 plaza buildings. What's the status on that and the Marilyn Monroe skirt [ph] and then should we expect with the spin a 20% corresponding reduction in RemainCo G&A soon?","Joseph Macnow","The first part of that is for David.","David Greenbaum","I'll go answer the G&A we are going to strive to achieve that if its difficult objective, because somehow G&A goes up, in ratchet, it doesn\u2019t come down quite the same way but its high on our priority list now that the spin is over to cut as much G&A after transition services have been completed both for our JBG Smith and still we are doing some transition services primarily and I see for Urban Edge. ","Joseph Macnow","As it relates to Penn Plaza, John. If you look at our portfolio as we have said, the portfolio is in great shape and the reality for us is Penn Plaza is the next extraordinary opportunity for us with the embedded rents in one and two Penn while we are achieving rents today as I said say $65 a foot we still think there is extraordinary embedded value in those assets, so we continue to work on redevelopment plans for One Penn Plaza, we continue to work on redevelopment plans for Two Penn Plaza which do include potentially a spinning of the building as well as an expansion of the building, we are in addition looking at more aggressive alternatives in terms of adding additional tonnage in Penn Plaza. ","So, all of that in on the table and it remains our highest priority, we will get back to you as soon as we have a real finalized plan and then some budgetary numbers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jed Reagan from Green Street Advisors. ","Jed Reagan","Hey good morning guys. I guess following up on the earlier question. You saw the positions in the race track and you mentioned MD&A as well. Are there other specific non-core legacy investments you could see exiting in the coming quarters and then you also talk about the plans for the few DC area assets that are staying with the company?","Steven Roth","I heard your question Jed about non-core assets, I didn\u2019t hear the last phrase.","Jed Reagan","Sorry, the few DC metro assets that are staying with RemainCo, if you could just talk about the plans for those?","Steven Roth","All of the non-core assets that Vornado continues to own and we're down to dribs and drabs now as well as assets which are DC assets which did not go into SpinCo will be sold. ","Jed Reagan","What kind of timeline should we think about for those?","Steven Roth","Some of them are tax protected, there is three or four large shareholdings moth of which is tax protected, I am not able right now to give you a timeline.","Jed Reagan","Okay fair enough. ","Steven Roth","There is a couple of loans that have maturity dates, let me look. And then the big one of course is [indiscernible] which was not included in this spin.","Jed Reagan","Okay, thanks a lot and congratulations on the lease with Aetna, it sounds like there is still good momentum in that West Chelsea area, that I think it's an area that has kind of a fragmented ownership and mostly smaller assets, so how do you think about building scale in that sub market overtime and then do you hope to grow elsewhere and midtown south or perhaps even downtown going forward?","Steven Roth","Well I would call the Farley building real scale Jed. So, it's difficult to get scale but that\u2019s our job. So, one of the things that makes the market attractive is its physical nature and there are a great number of these creative tenants who really shy away from big rents office buildings. So, the answer is that we are putting together a very exciting, very fine portfolio in this most important and hot district and you do it piece by piece. ","David Greenbaum","I guess the only thing I would add to that Jed, just a comment on the Aetna transaction, following up what Steve said, is Aetna as you would have expected looked at both New York and Boston and within the city locate a number of the new builds around the city, what attracted Aetna to a 619 in addition to its location was the unique nature that Aetna could have the entire building. So as Steve said a 2.5 million square foot building effectively was not attractive to the CEO and Chairman of Aetna, what he really looking to do is brand his company with his own asset. As you do look at the portfolio that we've effectively put together and you add up the 619 if you add up the 512, if you add up the 26011 and the 85 Tenths and the Farley's, you end up with a portfolio that\u2019s better part of 2 million to 3 million square feet which realistically is some real scale and that will follow with everything that we do in Penn Plaza. ","Steven Roth","And so, as I said, to add on to what David just said is the Farley building is real scale and our holdings in Penn Plaza are enormous scale and we think that Penn Plaza is adjacent to Hudson Yards, is just north of Chelsea and is going to be a full measure part of the creative district than the hot district. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O\u2019Neill. ","Alexander Goldfarb","Steve may be just following that, that path on Farley, does all the recent infrastructure needs of Amtrak Metro, MTA etcetera, does that help you guys, does that provide more opportunity at Penn Plaza as far as public, private or everything that you guys already contemplating, already has some element, though there is not necessarily any incremental that you may be able to get out of some additional public private. ","Steven Roth","That\u2019s a complicated involved question Alex. So basically, our position is that we own the up land and the governments owns the below grade and the railroad and the tracks and what of that. We\u2019re obviously, we're not in the railroad business, we're not in the railroad maintenance business. Penn station is as the governor has said repeatedly in speeches over the last year or two, everything, every transportation, every line of transportation in the New York region comes through Penn Station and that\u2019s what makes it unique and that\u2019s what makes it actually wonderful. The struggles that its having now because the infrastructure is long of tooth and perhaps it hasn\u2019t been maintained as well as it should have and as well as it will have been in the future, is unfortunate but on the other hand the fact that everybody is focused on it now and it will be put into a state of good repair is very fortunate. ","So, we are unbelievably happy and honored to own all of the real estates that we own above and around Pen Station. And we think that that just continues now -- will continue to work to our benefit. Whether there are any opportunities that will come out of the improvements that will be made to the infrastructure, the answer to that is I really don\u2019t think so or if there are opportunities they will be available to anybody -- any buyer or any bidder that would be us and in addition to anybody else. So, the long and the short of it is that we think that this is a district whose time has come.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then the second question switching gears to Alexander, can you give any update on replacing Seers, I mean I realize they will stop paying the rent but what's going to happen with that space if there is any timing any thoughts?","Steven Roth","We are in the market to replace seers and we go park that\u2019s an Alexander's asset just as you remember we owned -- Vornado owns about a third of Alexander's. So, we are in the market to replace Seers, Seers' lease expires in 2021 and while something may happen between now and 2021, for then to stop paying rent right now they are paying rent and we are looking for a replacement tenants.","One more thing Alex, Alexanders has a very large and very important and very valuable complex at that intersection which is the intersection of the Long Island Expressway and Queens Boulevard which is probably the most traffic intersection in all of Queens. So, we have got three separate assets there what we call Rego 1, Rego 2 and Rego 3, they sort of interplay with each other and we have opportunity to move tenants around in there. But as of right now Seers is closed, they are paying rent and we are in the market to redevelop that asset.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Michael Lewis from SunTrust is on the line with a question for the call.","Michael Lewis","Going last, so a lot of mine have been answered but I wanted to ask maybe a question for Joe, you present the same store in a lot of different ways. I was curious if you could share the New York same store revenue growth versus the expense growth and then you got a question about G&A savings, is there any operating margin differences between having just New York now.","Joseph Macnow","Michael good morning, I'm really not prepared to answer that question on the phone. Will do a little research and get back to you without giving you guidance which we don\u2019t do.","Michael Lewis","And then my second question, I'm not sure how much you could say on the SEDAR, you commented a little bit in the past on the 666 bids. I just wanted to ask if there was any update or plan on that asset?","Joseph Macnow","Well 666 is an asset which is, it's actually a wonderful asset in the heart of Upper Fifth Avenue. We own all the retail in the base of the building, we share the ownership of the office building, with the Krishna [ph] family 50-50, we have been internally debating what the business plan is for the asset and that debate continues and so we don\u2019t have an update on that right now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Steven Roth for closing comments. ","Steven Roth","Well thank you, thanks everybody for participating, I think this is a record time and we look forward to being with you again the next quarter. So, thank you all very much and have a very good summer. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Our speakers\u2019 will address your questions at the end of the presentation during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Cathy Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s second quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our second quarter earnings release and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents as well as our supplemental financial information package are available on our Web site, www.vno.com under the Investor Relations section.

Also in the room are Michael Franco, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer; and Joseph Macnow, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado\u2019s second quarter call. Our New York business had a very strong second quarter. Business continues to be good, very good actually except for the hotel business which continues to head south our Hotel Pennsylvania included, suffering from gross oversupply and a little Airbnb. We continue to participate in the bidding process for Farley and Penn Station. Our vast holdings in the Penn Plaza district in the very center of the new Westside are the next big thing, actually really big thing for our company.","We continue down the path of separating the Washington business. Development and progress in New York continues on pace. Our 220 Central Park South residential tower is selling well and is now up to the 57th floor and rising at the rate of one floor every four days. Our 60,000 square foot Victoria Secrets Flagship on Fifth Avenue is building towards a November opening. Construction of 61 Ninth Avenue which will be the new home of the 20,000 square foot Starbucks Roastery is in the foundation phase. Our highline project at 512 West 22nd Street is also underway and at 606 Broadway construction has begun.","In Washington and Pentagon City the Whole Foods and the 699 unit Bartlett have opened achieving an extraordinary 45% lease up in just the first two months way ahead of our underwriting. Down the block in Crystal City WeWork WeLive has also opened achieving 80% occupancy, of the two-thirds of the units that are opened. The success of Bartlett validates our plan to emphasize residential new builds on our nearby vacant land inventory and until next sites created by teardowns of older office buildings in Crystal City. Overtime we will develop over 2,600 additional units in Pentagon City and over 3,000 units in Crystal City. We will put into production 577 units adjacent to The Bartlett immediately. So in Crystal City, Pentagon City our business plan is residential heavy and new build heavy all while we continue to grow our office income.","A word about the financing and transaction markets. After a period of volatility in the first quarter the financing markets have settled down. We are in a borrowers' market for strong sponsors like us. The one category that has gotten tougher however in the construction loan market where availability has become limited and pricing has capped out. Sponsorship is essential here. This is curtailing the supply of new condos, new hotels and speculative development in New York which is good for us and may even create opportunities for us.","In the transactions market after a record breaking year in 2015 volumes are down roughly 25% year-over-year. This is driven by a variety of factors, volatility in the first quarter, shortage of high quality products, high prices all around and concern over fundamentals. Pricing remains strong for high quality office retail and multifamily products, so bidding pools have somewhat fizzed. Capital continues to aggressively pursue New York which is viewed as the safest, most vibrant and liquid market in the U.S. and perhaps the world. We expect this to continue and believe this trend is only in the early innings. We also think Brexit will likely push additional capital to New York.","A couple of comps are worth pointing out. 1250 Broadway a 721,000 square foot B office building at 32nd and Broadway a couple of blocks from our Penn Plaza Holdings went under contract to another foreign family for $565 million, $800 per square foot, a 2.3% going in cap rate and low 5% stabilized yield. This makes us feel very good about what we own nearby as our buildings are much better located and much higher quality. As a retail comp 155 Mercer Street a retail condo in SoHo occupied by Dolce & Gabbana recently went under contract to a private invested group for a $90 million at 2.6% stabilized cap rate. Finally pricing in San Francisco continues to set records 505 Howard Street, a 291,000 square feet new building near Transbay Center just went under contract for north of $1,200 per square feet. As the owner of the best building in San Francisco 555 California Street, we certainly like this valuation mark.","In May we a $300 million financial of 7 West 34th Street a 477,000 square foot Manhattan office building leased to Amazon and subsequently sold a 47% ownership interest in the property to the Korea Post sovereign wealth fund. The sale was based on a property of value of approximately $561 million or $1,176 per square foot. We received net proceeds of 127 million from the sale and realized a net gain of $202.7 million of which 159.5 million was recognized in the second quarter and 43.2 million has been deferred until the loan has been repaid. The tax gain was $90 million. We continue to manage and lease the property.","Now the leasing, companywide in the second quarter we leased 1.025 million square feet in 97 transactions, in New York we leased 544,000 square feet of office space including 259,000 square feet in Manhattan and 285,000 square feet in Long Island City. The average starting rent in Manhattan was $81.67 with positive mark-to-markets of 18.2% GAAP and 11.1% cash. Starting rent for Long Island City was $40.10 with positive mark-to-markets of 34.8% GAAP and 31.4% cash. In Washington we leased 369,000 square feet, the mark-to-markets excluding Skyline were flattish at negative 1.5% GAAP and 3.0% cash. Yesterday we called for redemption our 6 and 7A series J preferred shares in the principal amount of $246.6 million at a redemption price of par plus accrued. This will be funded as of cash balances and will result in an annual increase in FFO of $17 million or $0.08 per share.","With that, I will now turn it over to Steve Theriot to cover our financial results and financing activity.","Stephen Theriot","Thank you, Steve. Good morning everyone. Net income for the second quarter was $1.16 per share as compared to $0.87 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted FFO which we formally called comparable FFO for the second quarter was $1.23 per share as compared to $1.26 for the second quarter of 2015. As we previewed on last quarter's call, this year's second quarter has some accounting noise which masks the quarter's large comparable growth, so let me you talk through the math.","In our New York business, the quarter's results include 7.9 million of non-cash reduction of GAAP rent from the write-off of straight line rent receivables triggered by early termination of New York office leases primarily J. Crew and Structure Tone at 770 Broadway, Rocket Fuel at 100 West 33rd Street and Capital One 90 Park Avenue which enabled us to sign new replacement leases for these spaces with mark-to-markets of over 20% GAAP and cash. While this non-cash write-off of Straight Line rent receivable reduces our GAAP earnings in 2016, the new replacement leases are accretive from an economic perspective and will benefit future period earnings.","Further, when comparing this quarter's results to the prior year\u2019s second quarter remember that the prior year\u2019s second quarter included 5.4 million of non-cash income from the acceleration of FAS 141 below market leases related to our early termination of the Crate and Barrel lease at 650 Madison again to clear out space for higher paying tenants. In addition as David will explain shortly the Hotel Pennsylvania's results were behind last year's comparable quarter by 5.1 million. The punch line is that these items negatively affect the quarterly comparison of growth of our New York core earnings by 18.4 million or $0.09 per share. Excluding these items New York's earnings grew by 28.2 million or 11.1%. We reaffirm our guidance that adjusted EBITDA from our Washington business for the full year of 2016 will be 7 million to 11 million lower than 2015.","Let me comment on our FAD ratio which exceeded 100% for the quarter and will continue to remain elevated for the balance of 2016 as capital outlays for tenant improvements and landlord\u2019s work related to the bulge of leasing activity we completed in the last two years is occurring ahead of the commencement of the 216.5 million of cash rental revenue from this leasing activity as described in our Form 8K dated June 07, 2016.","Now turning to capital markets. In the quarter in addition to the 300 million financing of 7 West 34th Street that Steve mentioned we completed a 273 million refinancing of the Warner building a 621,000 square foot Washington DC office building in which we have a 55% ownership interest. The loan matures in June 2023 as the fixed rate of 3.65% is interest only for the first two years and amortizes based on a 30 year schedule beginning in year three. The property was previously encumbered by a 6.26% $293 million mortgage.","Also in the quarter at 280 Park Avenue the 1,250,000 square foot Manhattan office building we own in a joint venture. We completed a $900 million of refinancing. The three year loan with four one year options is interest only at LIBOR plus 2%. 2.45% at June 30, 2016. The property was previously encumbered by a 6.35% $725 million mortgage. We continue to negotiate with a special servicer of the $675 million mortgage on the Skyline properties in Bailey's Crossroads, Virginia. The loan has recoursed only to these Skyline properties. In the second quarter cash flow became insufficient to service the debt and we ceased making debt service payments. The loan is in default causing the loan to be due and payable and subject to an incremental default rate of interest.","For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 we accrued 2.7 million of default interest expense. Excluding skyline our remaining 2016 consolidated debt maturities are 593.6 million consisting primarily of the 550 million 5.57% marked loan which matures in December. This loan is in the market for refinancing as we speak. Our share of partially owned entities 2016 debt maturities is 75.6 million. Excluding Skyline and the financing of our 220 Central Park South project which will self liquidate as signed contract close our consolidated debt metrics are fixed rate that accounted for 73% of debt with the weighted average rate of 4.1% and a weighted average term of 4.6 years and floating rate that accounted for 27% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.17% and a weighted average term of 5.2 years.","Debt to enterprise value was 24%. Debt net of cash to EBITDA is 5.2 times including our share of partially owned entities debt other than towards or us debt net of cash to EBITDA is 6.2 times. In closing Vornado has a fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and our maturities are well staggered. We have 4.3 billion liquidity comprised of 1.9 billion of cash restricted cash and marketable securities and 2.4 billion undrawn under our 2.5 billion revolving credit facilities.","I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum.","David Greenbaum","Steve, thank you. I want to begin with my remarks by offering a few observations on the current market and what it means for Vornado. We've moved through an unusually volatile first half of this year, a China slowdown and a surprise Brexit vote, despite the disrupted potential of these two events, the stock market has been resilient while many of the headlines we have seen have described the real estate markets has quote moving sideways the reality of what we have been seeing on the ground is that pricing has held hold and activity has remained robust. Leasing through the first six months of the year in the city totaled 19.5 million square feet comparable to 10 year averages although activities was largely driven by renewals. Importantly sublease vacancy at 1.6% is the lowest it has been in eight years.","On prior calls we've talked about the important diversification of the New York marketplace with the growth of TAMI sector making the city less reliant on the traditional financial services sector. Interestingly this year we've seen tremendous demand from the education sector as well as the healthcare sector which has taken traditional office space for medical offices and outpatient services.","Just recently NYU Langone leased an entire building on East 41st Street. This building which was less than 15 years old have been occupied by a prominent law firm, while not typically considered a large occupier of office space over the last five years some 8 million square feet has been leased by the combined healthcare and education sectors and we at Vornado have a significant share of those operations. With Columbia University doctors at 1290 Avenue of The Americas and NYU Langone at 1 Park Avenue and Memorial Sloan Kettering at 650 Madison Avenue a total of 700,000 square feet of healthcare operations.","Ultimately the key to our market is jobs specially office using jobs. For the first six months of the year, the city added 37,000 private sector jobs to an all-time high at 5% for city's unemployment rate is at the lowest level since April 2007. Office sector jobs did reflect some weakness in May and June with a net loss of approximately 15,000 jobs, but these numbers may reflect noise attributable to the Verizon strike. Two months do not make a trend and we will continue to monitor these numbers closely.","Our portfolio is in great shape and is incredibly well positioned. On the office side we have eight trophy buildings that command 100 plus dollar rents. We have a growing concentration on Manhattan's West Side including Penn Plaza and Chelsea where tenants increasingly want to be. We've completed a string of major building redevelopments over the last three years totaling 6.5 million square feet, ensuring that our assets remain up-to-date and attractive to tenants across all market sectors. And we now have significant additional growth opportunities associated with the redevelopment in our huge Penn Plaza portfolio. One Penn Plaza and Two Penn Plaza alone represent over 4 million square feet. On the street retail side our flagship portfolio is concentrated on the best high streets, Upper Fifth Avenue, the Bowtie in Times Square, Madison Avenue, Soho and 34th Street.","Let me now turn to the quarter beginning with our office portfolio. Our occupancy at the end of the second quarter ticked down slightly by 40 basis points to 96%. In a multitenant portfolio with over 1,000 tenants we remain basically full. During the second quarter we completed 544,000 square feet of leasing activity in 28 transactions. About 50% of our leasing activities some 259,000 square feet was in Manhattan at starting rents of $81.67 representing mark to markets of 18.2% GAAP and 11.1% cash. This includes the 123,000 square foot lease with a law firm of Alston & Bird at 90, Park Avenue which joins PWC, FactSet and Foley & Lardner as the anchor tenants in this recently redeveloped asset.","The balance of our leasing activity this quarter some 285,000 square feet was attributable to the renewal of two leases with local governmental agencies at the center building in Long Island City. These leases had starting rents north of $40 per square foot reflect the rapidly changing Long Island City\u2019s landscape representing mark to markets of 34.8% GAAP and 31.4% cash. With these leases in place the yield on our investment in this building is now at 7% with significant additional upside still to be realized upon the releasing of the balance of this 470,000 square foot asset.","For the first six months of the year we closed six of Crane's list of the top Manhattan office leases, a total of 775,000 square feet. PWC and Alston & Bird at 90, Park Avenue, Facebook and AOL-Verizon at 770 Broadway, Bloomberg at 731 Lexington Avenue and Level 3 Communications at 85 Tenth Avenue. I spoke earlier of the quality of our New York portfolio, you continue to see that in our ability to make more than our fair share of deals of 100 plus dollars per square foot. In the second quarter we signed three such leases a total of 34,500 square feet at average starting rents of a $143 per foot year-to-date we have signed 9 triple-digit leases for a total of 375,000 square feet.","In our retail portfolio, during the second quarter, we completed 55,000 square feet of leasing activity in 10 transactions with positive mark-to-markets of 21.3% GAAP and 11.5% cash. This includes a new home for the Four Seasons Restaurant at 280 Park Avenue which we own in joint venture. After an extensive citywide search the Four Seasons selected 280 Park Avenue as the perfect location to reinvent this global icon after nearly six decades at the Seagram\u2019s building. The new restaurant when it opens in late in 2017 will complement our recently completed $150 million redevelopment program a clear sign of success in repositioning 280 Park Avenue.","At 692 Broadway AOL signed a 10,000 square feet lease for a new experiential concept [Technical Difficulty] space for the Huffington Post Live Interview Series and at 11 Penn Plaza MSG Networks renewed some [Technical Difficulty] of studio space on the ground floor in lower level. Our largest and best-in-class retail portfolio produced same-store results for the quarter of a positive 13.6% on a GAAP basis and 10.2% cash.","Let me turn to theMART in Chicago, in June we completed a $40 million renovation of the communal areas on both the ground and the second floors, it's oh wow, our introduction of a 50-foot wide grand stair standing over 5,000 square which also serves as a 200 plus seat amphitheater for meetings and special events. A shared lounge at the top of the stairs an outdoor green space and a giant food hall all have received rave reviews from our tenants than they complete the building\u2019s transition from showroom space to what Crain Chicago calls a top destination for technology tenants and the Chicago Tribune refer to as a magnet for companies seeking an urban millennial talent pool and we're not done yet.","Reflecting the scale of this unique asset at 3.6 million square feet and it's daily population of over 25,000 as well as a transit stop directly into the building we are now exploring opening up a retail artisanal market featuring local specialty food offerings. I would encourage you to visit our Web site at vno.com and click onto theMART to see the images of this transformation or even better yet ask Cathy Creswell to arrange a tour for you on your next visit to Chicago. ConAgra and All States have now moved into the building with Beam Suntory to follow in the fall.","For the first six months of this year, we have achieved average starting rents in the building of $50.83 per square foot on 89,000 square feet of leasing activity. We are substantially full with occupancy at 97.8% and we're continuing the transformation of this asset by converting at year-end an additional 80,000 square feet of trade show space on the 8th floor to additional office space. theMART same-store numbers for the second quarter were a very strong positive 13% GAAP and 8.4% cash.","Turning now to San Francisco, in the second quarter Bank of America expanded its presence in 554 California Street to house their West Coast executive office. And just last week after the end of the quarter, we closed a renewal lease of 50,000 square feet across two floors with McKinsey & Company a renowned consulting firm which is one of our longstanding tenants. With average starting rents north of $90 per square foot we believe these two tenants on top of the best tenant roster in town reaffirm the building status as the premier office building in San Francisco.","But we don't take that status for granted and we have kicked off a redevelopment program and redesign of the concourse level amenities in the 1.8 million square foot 555 California complex. This will include upgrades of tenant amenity spaces and of course multiple new food offerings. The occupancy in the complex now stands at 92.1% reflecting the space that we recently got back when BofA vacated its original banking cube. We are now working on plans for an adaptive reuse for what we call the cube and are in active dialogue with tenants seeking an iconic presence as part of the streetscape of San Francisco.","Overall for the New York division we had a very strong quarter with same-store increases of 6.9% GAAP and [Technical Difficulty] cash. The same-store numbers include the results of the Hotel Pennsylvania where as Steve mentioned business has been very weak reflecting the down cycle in the New York hotel business. If you exclude the Hotel Pennsylvania our New York same-store numbers for the second quarter were a robust positive 9.2% GAAP and 8.5% cash.","To conclude my remarks let me say we remain very constructive on the New York marketplace. With a highly diversified multitenant portfolio, lease expirations are quite modest for the balance of this year at 350,000 square feet and modest next year as we look out with 800,000 square feet of expiries with no one tenant representing more than 120,000 square feet. All of this reflects our aggressive leasing program where over the last 2.5 years we have leased 7.5 million square feet. And our pipeline of activity remains strong with over a million square feet of leases in active dialogue.","Thank you, I'll now turn the call over to Mitchell Schear to cover Washington.","Mitchell Schear","Thank you, David and good morning everybody. I'll begin with a few comments on the DC market. The Washington DC metropolitan area economy is continuing its positive direction. Nearly 72,000 jobs were added in the 12 months ending April 2016. Importantly for our business 24% of that growth is being driven by office using professional and business services including tech related and STEM sectors. Unemployment in the DC region had continued downward is now at a very low 3.5% for the region as compared to 4.7% for the country.","In the second quarter, both Downtown DC and Northern Virginia absorption picked up with 370,000 square feet in Northern Virginia and 526,000 square feet in DC. Year-to-date the numbers are showing slow but steady absorption. In residential the DC Metro area is experiencing modest positive absorption notwithstanding the positive economic backdrop the real estate market continues to bounce along the bottom.","Let me review our second quarter leasing and occupancy metrics and please note all of these exclude Skyline properties. We completed 326,000 square feet of office and retail leases in 39 transactions. Mark-to-Markets were flattish negative 1.5% GAAP and negative 3% cash. Overall occupancy was 91.3% down 80 basis points from 92.1% in the first quarter. Office occupancy decreased to 89.2% from 90.6% in the first quarter. The primary driver of the lower occupancy is two GSA tenants who vacated both of which we expected. We are seeing activity from smaller tenants 5,000 to 20,000 square feet. And finally residential occupancy increased by 120 basis points to 98.2%.","In our Crystal City and Pentagon City residential business, it was a very active quarter. In June we opened The Bartlett our new 699-unit apartment building in Pentagon City located directly atop a new 40,000 square foot Whole Foods. This 23 storey building has unbeatable views of the Washington Skyline and the best residential amenity package in the metropolitan DC area. When surveyed 67% of our residents report that they selected The Bartlett due to our extensive amenity package consisting of 40,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor space validating our intense focus on the tenant experience. The market response to The Bartlett thus far has been terrific. Our first renters moved in on June 02nd and through yesterday we had leased 314 units that is 45% of the building already. With this velocity and rents that are higher than we projected we're very pleased with our performance to-date.","Meanwhile in Crystal City, WeWork opened its first location in Northern Virginia in our building at 2221 South Clark Street. Here, we transformed an older office building into a WeWork community that combines 216 community style apartments with their proven co-working office space. This collaborative living approach has attracted a whole new crowd to the streets of Crystal City and it\u2019s invigorating. The leasing activity has been strong with 80% of the units occupied that have opened to-date. We are pleased to be WeWork's partner in this venture.","The Bartlett and WeLive bring our residential portfolio to over 3,300 units. Our properties are all metro-served in Georgetown in close in Arlington. We like this business in these locations and plan to continue our expansion. As Steve mentioned in July we received approvals to develop the next phase of the Metropolitan Park block a new 577 unit apartment project right next to The Bartlett. The building will feature contemporary style architecture coupled with Vornado's signature premium amenities and 10,000 square feet of additional retail. It will stand 22 stories tall and like The Bartlett will have commanding views of DC. We plan to start construction at the beginning of next year.","Including this new project we can build almost 5,600 additional apartments in Crystal City and Pentagon City on vacant land that we already own and on a few sites created by a few select teardowns of aging office buildings. In downtown DC at the corner of 17th and M Street we are emptying the final tenant to make way for our new 335,000 square foot Trophy office building 1700 M Street. Our plan is to begin demolition within the next 90 days and build a new garage and foundation back to grade while actively marketing the building. With the garage and foundation complete this will put us in an excellent position competitively to go vertical when the time is right.","I thank you and I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And from Citi we have Manny Korchman on line, please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","Hi it's Michael Bilerman with Manny. Steve, in your opening remarks, you said you continue down a path of separation for the DC business. I'm wondering if you can just expand on that a little bit. How much of that is solely spinning off the business as is versus potentially exploring other structures in terms of sale, joint ventures, mergers? I guess is it spin or go, or is other things still being discussed?","Steven Roth","I don't think that I have very much more to say than I have said. We're continuing down the path, we have not been bashful in saying over the last number of quarters that we thought that this was a very good idea for both businesses and we have said frequently publicly the reasons why we think that's true, all that continues and we continue down that path with respect to the other part of your question about conversations that we might or may have not be having with other people etcetera I don't think I have anything more to say about that.","Michael Bilerman","And then my follow up is just in terms of balance sheet management. You called the preferreds or at least one of the series of preferreds. I guess what's your view on the remaining -- you still have another $1 billion of this stuff outstanding, call it around a 6% yield. Do you think about the return you're getting on almost $2 billion of cash pretty much nothing, versus the cost of debt today, whether it be 10-year, or even 30-year debt. I guess why not take out the whole stack of preferreds. And I can remember 15, 20 years ago you used to quip that preferreds had a maturity date of never. But it just seems like a pretty high cost to be paying for that money where there's alternatives today. So maybe just talk about the remaining preferreds and your thoughts on cap structure?","Steven Roth","I like your memory, with a due date of never, I remember that, by the way that's still true. I mean I think your comments are valid. We have always for as long as I've run this company which is decades had a slug of a billion dollars plus of preferred which has a due date of never and the reason for that was it creates stability and it's better than debt and better than common stock. Now today we're in a period where and by the way the other thing about this about perpetual preferred is that it's asymmetrical in its call arrangements because the issuer can call after the five years without penalty which is we think as asymmetrical feature in our favor.","So we have called the first one, we will pay for it out of cash balances that will increase our distributable earnings by $17 million and we think that's fine. ","We have reviewed the balance of that preferred stock and obviously we're thinking about our options, our options are do nothing leave those various series in place, pay them off which would then change the complexion of our liquidity a little bit or maybe even more than a little bit or refinance them at lower rates a perpetual preferreds. My guess is that the current rate for Vornado's credit in that market is about 5.25% maybe even a pinch below that, so those are the options we're considering them but we have nothing to say about that at the current time.","Operator","From Bank of America, we have Jamie Feldman on line. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thank you. Good morning. So you had commented also Penn Plaza and Moynihan Station being a big part of the Company's future. Can you just give us an update on where you stand today in terms of maybe the bid for Moynihan and just an update on plans and timing and spending?","Steven Roth","The answer is, obviously the Penn Plaza district is I've said this before kind of is the big kahuna. We have vast holdings there and interestingly as the Island of Manhattan tilts to the west and tilts to the South, we find ourselves in the bull's-eye of the new West Side of Manhattan with great opportunity. So if you just looked at our office buildings there with the current in place rent versus what the rents might be in the future, we have a very-very-very good economic situation. With respect to the bidding process of Moynihan and Farley and Penn Station, this is a government procurement process which is being run very carefully by the government and we really cannot and do not have anything to say about that process other than we are an aggressive participant.","With respect to the timing of that we can't predict it and with the respect to the capital that will be required to transform Penn Plaza, we are aggressively anxious to get underway as quickly as we can. We have the capital, we have the plans and we have the property. Most importantly we have the property. So I think that that pretty much covers it whatever happens in that district with respect to the bidding process the district is transformed forever by the tilt towards the West side of Manhattan that's going on in the marketplace.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Thank you. And then a follow-up, just to follow-up on you mentioned in 2017 there's no lease expiring more than I think 125,000 square feet. Can you maybe dovetail that with your latest NOI bridge? I think the $200 million of New York NOI, I assume that's moved a little since your NAREIT presentation based on leasing in the second quarter. Maybe just tell us where that stands and how to think about expirations for next year.","Steven Roth","David you want to handle that one?","David Greenbaum","The NOI bridge Jamie which we talked about on our last call realistically was attributable to the bulge of leasing activity that we had completed over the last couple of years which I talked about the 7.5 million square feet including the activity realistically in the first quarter the PWC lease as well as the Alston & Bird lease which we just signed was actually 2018 expiration which we forward leased. So as I look out in terms of basically the call it 4% vacancy that we have in the portfolio and a relatively modest amount of expirations that we have coming up for the balance of this year and into next. We've got call it 1.1 million square feet, 1.2 million square feet of lease expiries coming up over the next 18 months. We are in dialogue right now with probably about half of that space in terms of tenant renewals, and similarly in terms of vacant space or space that we expect to get back for example we know in the second half of this year we're going to be getting back space from U.S. Customs which is a tenant that moved into our building after the catastrophe of 9\/11 and is moving back into World Trade Center downtown. We have got very good activity, so I don't think Steve unless we want to say anything specifically about the bridge, I don't think there's anything material to talk about in terms of that number.","Steven Roth","Yes sure, I would just add a couple of things Jamie, the huge what we call a bulge of lease 7.5 million square feet that we did over the last couple of years has accomplished several things, number one, it basically ensured the income of the Company for years in the future. Second the leasing was done at higher rents which ensures a really huge growth I mean did we mentioned that in our 8K, I think couple of months ago which is I think $216 million something like that number and so we ensured the bulge of leasing we accomplished over the last couple of years ensures the income and the rising income in the future of the Company for years to come.","David Greenbaum","And Jamie just to follow-up on the bridge that we did in that June 07 8K and we used at the REIT week meetings, when we re-measured our forecast data as of the end of Q2 we were on-track with the information that we had presented previously and so it's moving according to what we would have expected which isn't surprising given that it's all contractual.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, thanks. That's very helpful.","Steven Roth","Thank you, Jamie.","Operator","From Sandler O'Neill we have Alexander Goldfarb on the line, please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Steve, just on the DC decision, one of the things you guys had outlined was that DC and New York have divergent capital needs and different return thresholds, and therefore it would be difficult for DC to get adequate funding relative to the potential of New York investment. So if the decision is made to not go forward with DC, and yet DC has a lot more resi, a lot more development in it, how do we reconcile that sort of concept that DC would need more capital, and yet the return seem to be better in New York?","Steven Roth","I sort of challenge your basic assumption, the capital that is going to be invested in DC will be invested for at fine profits and fine returns, so I'll give you an example I mean we have been -- we are thrilled with this Bartlett. If you all haven't seen it, you ought to make a trip down there and take a look. So it's the largest scale apartment building, the largest amenity package and the most well received. I think done in the Washington district in years and years and years. From a math point of view, we created that building at a give or take a seven and the value of that building if you value the marketplace for first class apartment house or an apartment a new, brand new product is X. If you divide those two numbers there is a very satisfactory return on that capital.","And by the way we built that building free and clear we didn\u2019t use any debt to build that building. So the long and the short of it is and I think I said in my prepared remarks that we want to get as many of those Bartlett buildings we want to build the next one immediately the one after that quickly and more and more and more, so we think that that's a very interesting business. And we're excited about, so we have the ingredients to make that happen. Most importantly we have the very scarce, very important land holdings in and around Pentagon City and in Crystal City so if you don't have the land you're not going anywhere. The second thing is we have the capital to do this development. Third is the return expectations are actually terrific very satisfactory and we have the management team that has proven the ability to develop these assets. So we're extremely optimistic about development in and around Crystal City and Pentagon City.","And I don't think I was natural in my opening remarks. Now I look at this a little differently, if we do separate it and by the way we have sort of that\u2019s the path that we're going on. So if we do complete that I have full intention of holding my shares in Vornado and holding my shares in Washington Co. or whatever you want to call it. So I look upon it as if it's just moving from one pocket to the other, it will be well capitalized with enough capital I am talking about Washington Co. or the SpinCo. So complete its development and complete its mission and there you have it. So I don't think it's an either or I think that our Company will do both if we separate the businesses, the new business will be capitalized to complete its developing mission for sure.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, that's helpful, Steve. Then second question is just on a project-specific basis, 606 Broadway, 3,000 a foot for office-retail combo. Can you just give us a little bit more color as far as maybe rent expectations or what's driving -- there was land cost that was high -- but what's sort of driving it? Obviously, it's a desirable purchase for what you guys spent, but clearly it's not your typical office retail development.","Steven Roth","Well, you know that's true, first of all we love the spot. We love the exposure it's like it's got a like a Hollywood front, it's all front and very little depth so it's extremely visible. It's an extremely visible asset and a very important part of Manhattan. So there's that. It's actually small the knock on this deal is, why are -- from internally when we talk about it it's small, small for us, but nonetheless we thought that the asset was of such a quality that we wanted to take a shot and we did. So it's expensive per square foot, we are optimistic that the rents will justify, and by the way at the lower end of return thresholds this is not going to be a four bagger, but we like the promise of the asset, it's small which is a negative, we think it will generate rents that will justify the high cost but we just can\u2019t predict the rents now, it's too early we're just getting started.","Alexander Goldfarb","But you would think it would sort of be mid-single digits or higher than that?","Steven Roth","It'll be, and it'll be higher than mid but certainly not double-digits.","Alexander Goldfarb","Helpful, thank you Steve.","Operator","From Evercore ISI we have Steve Sakwa, please go ahead.","Steve Sakwa","You talked about some of the pricing comps, whether it be in New York or in San Francisco. And I'm just curious how you are sort of thinking about kind of acquisitions and dispositions at this point in the cycle and whether you want to husband more capital, make special dividends back to shareholders or just kind of stay pat as it is right now?","Steven Roth","That's a huge omnibus question let me see if I can tackle it in pieces. First off we're very-very happy with where we are, where we stand right now. We worked very hard for the last three-four years to get here. So our debt is very low, when Steve Theriot went through some of the statistics he just said causally well all our debt is 25%, well 25% is extraordinarily low. Our debt ratios are great, our liquidity is superb the best in the business and so we're very pleased with that position. Having said that we evidenced by our calling a series up preferreds yesterday that we think that it's not inappropriate to pay off high 6% securities with cash that's earning nil, which will augment and increase our earnings. Doesn't affect us from an NAV point of view but it certainly increases our earnings.","In terms of acquisitions and dispositions I said over the last better part of the year and a half, maybe even longer that pricing in the marketplace is high that the easy money has been made and that we look upon acquisitions with great care and scrutiny and that continues to be the case. There has been no decline in pricing first quality asset that we seek. There has been some disruption in the hotel market. There hasn't been hotel sold in Manhattan this year to-date and the reason is the hotel business as we discussed already is very soft. Obviously the condo, not obviously but factually the condo market is also soft, not our condo of course other people's condos that is sort of a joke it's really nice joke it's really factual. And so we are not aggressively interested in buying at the prices that are currently that first class last properties are currently offering. And so I think that's where we're. Now these markets are volatile. They can change. We are ready for whatever happens and I think there you have it my friend.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And I don't know if you or David would care to do just a quick maybe recap on street retailers. There's obviously lots of concerns kind of in the marketplace just over sort of the street retail business in general and kind where rents are and some of the softness that we are seeing in kind of on the lower part of Fifth. But maybe in just quick nutshell, can you kind of go around Manhattan and sort of tell us how things are today?","Steven Roth","Sure, as I've said for way more than a year or now rents in Manhattan has gotten too high. So our job is to be realistic, we're not in a hope business, we're in the realistic business, and so believe rents have gotten to the point where they're too high. And the retailers are not comfortable paying those rents, so that's step one. The second part of it is, is our retail portfolio is pretty food, very full actually. We completed the last two big deals in town the Victoria's Secret huge mega-deal on Fifth Avenue and the Swatch mega-deal on Upper Fifth as well, so we're very pleased with our positioning. The quality of our assets is the best in town by far. Now let's go around the horn. The liquidity or the depth of the retail market has gotten very thin, so four years ago or five years ago there might have been three or four or more retailers bidding for a particular prime space on a prime street, right now there is barely one or two.","And it's difficult to close because the retailers are concerned, retailers are concerned about their own business models and less concerned about expansion. So the market is slow, retail rents or asking rents are too high we're aware of that and obviously in the business of being realistic and making deals. And I think the soft markets are where the volumes on the streets are not doing well. So Madison Avenue is soft. Lower Fifth is very soft. Upper Fifth is the volumes are fine but the number of tenants that want to pay the rents are scarce. Times Square continues to be I believe the strongest in my opinion the strongest market in the city SoHo and Broadway are soft-ish, 34th Street is doing fine, so I think that's going around the horn.","Steve Sakwa","Great. Thanks.","Operator","From Stifel we have John Guinee, please go ahead.","John Guinee","Great, thank you very much. Two questions, one I guess for Mitchell. You mentioned something sort of interesting about tearing down Crystal City buildings. You've got 21 buildings there, about 7 million square feet. Which ones, or can you give us a general sense as to what would be torn down and why? And then the next question is big picture. Steve and Steve, etcetera, you guys have done a fabulous job trying to help the Street understand future economics, a 7% return on The Bartlett, $216 million NOI bridge. I think foremost on a lot of people's mind is how they actually quantify what's going on at Penn Station. When would you be in a position to do that, and what magnitude are we talking about in terms of total dollars committed?","Steven Roth","That's a mouthful, Mitchell do you want to handle the teardowns at Crystal City for a second and then I'll counter punch and then we'll get into the rest of John's question.","Mitchell Schear"," Good morning John, the -- in Crystal City there really, if we just focus on two particular assets, we have a vacant asset on Crystal Drive with what we used to refer to as Mall 3 and we also have a building Plaza Five on 23rd Street. Those are, those buildings aggregate about 0.5 million square feet, those buildings are currently basically empty and ready for redevelopment, so if you take those buildings and look at what we can build as a result of the Crystal City sector plan, we have almost 2 million square feet on that 500,000 plus square feet of what's built at the moment and each of those sites could handle ultimately up to a 1,000 apartment units. So I think we think that it is, it makes all good economic sense, it makes all good sense with respect to place makings and adding these apartments and in terms of what the overall mix would be.","John Guinee","Great, thank you.","Steven Roth","Let me give you a little bit more on that same topic. So what we\u2019re going to do is take the oldest most, the oldest building, so the oldest buildings are 40 years old, something like that, office buildings and we have a worked with the government powers at B so that in general we can take down an older building and rebuild a building which is a 150% the size of that or something like that, okay. So the financial analysis goes like this, you take this 40 year old building or whatever and throw a significant amount of capital into that building to let it, with the understanding that that capital will have to be amortized over pick a number 10 year lease and at the end of that 10 year lease that 40 year old building is now 50 years old, so that's one column of numbers and concepts.","The second column is, is that you take it down, build a brand new residential building which will have -- which in today's environment has the lowest exiting cap rate or value rate and that's just the matter of math. And we believe that the math shows that the teardown of the oldest buildings in favor of brand new first class residential product is a very-very profitable and good trade. In addition to that when you get 1000s of units in a tight cluster, you get a community and that creates more value and we know how to create that community and amenities it and make it so that people will consider this a very-very fine place to live thinking about where it is, where it's located to where jobs are the metro access of it and by the way it is a very short walk to Pentagon City Mall which is one of the top 10 malls in the country and The Whole Foods et cetera. So we' believe that there is a -- we believe in the future of Crystal City, Pentagon City and these assets. We believe in it greatly. Now having said all that I forgot the second question.","John Guinee","Just the magnitude of what you're doing at Penn Station is just stunning, 4 million square feet at One and Two Penn, probably tear down Hotel Pennsylvania, the skirt, all sorts of ancillary assets that you own there, Penn Station and everything else. Is this $2 billion or $20 billion in capital committed over how many years -- what sort of return on cost?","Steven Roth","So Listen John as excited as I am about what I just said about Pentagon City and Crystal City, I am even more excited about Penn Station okay. So really when you think about it, you have to take it into term bite size pieces, okay, first is that the change in the submarket and the reorientation of the market's preferences for geography in Manhattan. So we think we've got the bull's-eye okay. So we've got $1 billion Macy's and Madison Square Garden and we sit on top of the station. We don't sit four blocks away you have to walk to it in the rain. We sit on top of it. So the basic and by the way the basis that we have in our buildings you can go back in history when we started putting together the assemblage 15 years ago, our basis is pretty extraordinary.","So you have all that is a backdrop, now the way we look at it let's take and cut it into bite size pieces, so take One Penn and Two Penn which together a 4 million plus square feet. The average rents are published. You know what they are, the first digit is a five and we believe that, notwithstanding anything else we can transform those building in this marketplace so that the average starting rent will be higher. I don\u2019t want to get into math now, but higher than what they are now maybe even quite substantially higher. So that's the capital program and we're going to do that and that's actually the number one priority of what we're about. And then there is peripheral development the retail opportunities are unique and extraordinary and then we have got some big stuff like the Hotel Penn, which we have I think very intelligently delayed up until now and so we\u2019d have it, what we do is we take -- we leg into the project piece by piece.","Now with respect to the overall amount of capital that we will be committed to this district it's 8-9 million feet it's huge, it's enormous it all has very large paybacks and the most important part of it is, is Vornado is a fortress financially and has the capital ability to finance all this. So I'm not ready to put out any numbers, I'm only able right now to talk about the concept and I can't tell you how excited we are about this opportunity and we're pretty excited about Crystal City and Pentagon City too.","John Guinee","Great, thank you.","Steven Roth","Thank you, John.","Operator","From Green Street Advisors we have Jed Reagan, please go ahead.","Jed Reagan","Good morning guys. Can you talk a little bit more about the overall tempo of sales demand at 220 Central Park South? And I think you mentioned on the last call that you were negotiating two important deals. Is there any update on how those have progressed?","Steven Roth","They've progressed to Signature, so 220 Central Park South is a very public project the residential markets so everything that I say gets into the newspapers and whatever. So we don't really have a lot to say about 220 Central Park South other than a; it's selling fabulously well, there's never been a project in New York that has sold as well. There was a slowdown in the marketplace for five or six months. That slowdown ended a couple of months ago, we're getting good traffic, the traffic that we're getting are extremely qualified buyers, the project is heavily skewed towards New Yorkers and Americans, and we couldn\u2019t be more delighted. The project is exceeding our expectations both in terms of sales velocity and numerical performance.","Jed Reagan","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And on the residential development plans in Crystal City and Pentagon City, how are you guys thinking about the competitive supply picture in the area, and is there enough demand to absorb what you guys and others are doing?","Steven Roth","Mitchell?","Mitchell Schear","Hi Jed, so I think that if you look at what's happening with The Bartlett, we said that in a very short period of time we have leased 45% of the building, so we think that a heavy amenitized building, you give somebody a really efficient plus or minus 700 square foot one bedroom apartment and you give them a tremendous amount of amenities in the building we think that's a real formula for success and a real market demand for that. Having said that, in the Pentagon Crystal City market we really control a substantial amount of the development pipeline. There are some other projects there are some other units but not a significant amount over the pipeline period that we're thinking about, so we have the opportunity to both build the quality product, measure the demand, meet the demand and also modulate the supply as we see it. So we're very comfortable with our position and with our the program at this point.","Steven Roth","Yes I'm going to be a little bit more aggressive in answering. So, at 220 Central Park South, which you seemed to be especially interested in, we have the best site, we have the best project, we have the best design et cetera. But as importantly, we bring a 2% cost of capital to that project, we are competing against people up and down the block, in fact all over the place that are paying 12% and 13% for money as you can imagine it's not a fair fight, okay. In Crystal City and Pentagon City my thinking is not dissimilar to that, we own great land parcels and so I look upon on that right now as being a sub-cost. We have the capital to build and develop and this is different than office buildings. If you put up a 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 square foot spec office building and you catch us a weak market. The building either stays vacant for year after year after year and by the way there is dozens of examples of that in the Washington region or you have to take the price down to a number which locks in a huge loss.","Residential development is different than that and that is it for a very marginal reduction in the monthly rate, you can get to -- you can rent, and you can get absorption. So it's a totally different business. Now the other thing that's interesting is that in the office side of life, you sign a long-term lease and you're locked into that price good or bad for a very long time. In the residential business, the rents won't fluctuate with the market. And so overtime you're able to get what the market is, the market thinks is the fair rent. So they're very different, we will be aggressive in building on the land that we already own there that's our business plan.","Jed Reagan","Sure, okay. And then just last one, a housekeeping item. On the 200-plus million of cash revenue you've laid out for the next couple of years, do you have a breakout of that revenue between the current same-store pool and the non-same-store pool?","Steven Roth","I don't. I mean it's substantially all same-store Jed.","Jed Reagan","Okay. Thank you.","Steven Roth","Which is another way of saying that we expect our same-store numbers on a cash basis to rise aggressively.","Operator","From UBS we have Nick Yulico. Please go ahead.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. I just had one question, just on the accounting for the 220 Central Park South project. So I know a year ago you reversed the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset because you were confident in generating enough income from selling the project to realize a tax asset. So hypothetically let's say the world got tougher, sales pace slowed or what have you, how should we think about how much cushion is there so you wouldn't have to put the valuation allowance back on and create an expense against your FFO?","Steven Roth","We're all looking at each other trying to -- I mean we have NOLs in the taxable REIT subsidiary in which we\u2019re doing the development which is what the reversal of the deferred valuation allowance relates to, but if you look at where pricing is today based on the contracts that are in place today, we think that's a very-very low risk that we'll be reversing or putting back evaluation allowance on those to protect assets I mean, you know it's very low risk.","Nick Yulico","Okay. That's all I had. Thanks guys.","Operator","And our final question from Citi, we have a follow-up from Manny Korchman, please go ahead.","Manny Korchman","Yes, had two quick follow-ups. One, Steve, you've talk about the street retail business being a global business. And I'm just curious. With Brexit, does that mean you take a look at London but potentially pick off some assets over there, or is that a nonstarter?","Steven Roth","I go to London a couple of times a year.","Manny Korchman","I know that would you go shopping for Vornado though?","Steven Roth","The answer is, is that we have no current plans to invest in London.","Manny Korchman","And then you made a comment in your opening remarks talking about construction loans and how the difficulty in that market and that it may present opportunities for Vornado. I was wondering if you can just sort of expand a little bit on what you would deem opportunities. Do you see yourself as a lender? Do you see yourself as being able to pick up projects where someone can't get financing and sort of taking over the construction? And in that vein, I guess what property types would you be willing to do these activities? Is it condo, is it multi, is it retail, or just traditional office?","Steven Roth","Well we have the full array of skill sets in here. We have a monster fortress balance sheet for capital. We have the best operating platform in the business, we have the best leasing teams in the business, we have the best construction and development teams in the business so we have the full array of skills and strengths needed to function in good markets and in bad markets. We run our business and have run it for decades so that we are strongest when the market gets weakest, because that's the time when, that's the best time to invest. Having said that I mean it's pretty obvious what our preferences are, our preferences are to be an equity player as opposed to a lender. Our preferences are to be in the income producing property business as opposed to the one-time for sale condo business. We're doing 220 Central Park South now the last one we did was a dozen years ago on top of Bloomberg, so this is not a regular business for us.","And the -- so our preference is, is to be an owner rather than a lender, our preference is to be an equityholder rather than a seller. The product types that we are expert in are obviously office and retail, so those are the two, that's where our two main interests are. We also have a residential portfolio in Manhattan which is performing quite well and that is a business with the correct entry point that we would invest in, although we don't have anywhere near the scale in that business that we have in office and in retail. So having said that we're open to business everyday and we have a history over the years of making some of our very best deals when there's some level of distress or disruption in the lending market people get over-leveraged, etcetera, so we are very alert and looking for that as we speak.","Michael Bilerman","And maybe while I have you, just one quick last one, you've made massive strategy simplification of the Company and significant strides in terms of disclosure. Having these quarterly calls is a massive step in providing the Street with updates. I'm curious of thoughts in terms of potentially have evolved on providing earnings guidance. With the Company being much more simplified in terms of items, is that something that's on the table or you just will never sort of do this or guide the Street in terms of earnings?","Steven Roth","I don't want to speculate on that. I mean I read Warren Buffett's position. I read the very interesting Treatise on Governance that came out a couple of weeks ago by some industry leaders both -- on the investment side. There is two sides and three sides of that issue and I don't want to get -- I don\u2019t want to comment on it because obviously we talk about it a little bit inside not a lot, a little bit. But I really don't want to speculate as to we even what we think about it. We're not unhappy with where we're. I appreciate your comment that we have made massive strides in simplification in disclosure, etcetera. And we agree with you and I think I'll just leave it at that.","Michael Bilerman","I'm just thinking about you've had a couple of quarters now where the earnings have missed the Street and there's very good rational reasons to point those out. I just wonder if there was a little bit more specifics in terms of what was coming, that everyone knew you wouldn't get an adverse market reaction to the results?","Steven Roth","Yes, I can't tell you how I agree with you, we get ourselves into -- the last couple of quarters we missed the Street, but we never told the Street anything so the Street is missing itself. So that is the first thing I can tell you that I am really and not -- and that is about beat a penny raise a penny culture and we try to avoid that. I understand what you're saying, we have thought about it as I said a little bit and I don\u2019t have anything more to say about it.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now turn back to Steven Roth for closing remarks.","Steven Roth","Thank you everybody. We learn from these calls and we appreciate the dialogue and we'll be back on I guess the next which is when November 1st. So we'll see everybody before that I am sure, but we'll be back on the phone with you on November 1st. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Catherine Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust's Second Quarter Earnings Call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our second quarter earnings release and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents, as well as our supplemental financial information package, are available on our website, www.vno.com, under the Investor Relations section.","In these documents and during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Also in the room are Wendy Silverstein and Michael Franco, Executive Vice Presidents, Co-Heads of Acquisitions and Capital Markets. I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thanks, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's second quarter earnings call. I'd like to begin by reiterating our commitment to our strategy of simplifying and focusing the business. We are making very good progress and steady progress in that regard. And we will continue to do so.","As I've said several times recently, in this market, we will buy carefully, and this year sell more than we buy. We will be net sellers this year. We will continue to focus internally where we have much to do and a lot to harvest. We will build cash reserves to further fortify our fortress balance sheet and to take advantage of opportunities that will undoubtedly present themselves in the future. Our cash position today is $1.1 billion, with over $2.4 billion available on our $2.5 billion of revolvers.","Overall, our current liquidity position today is $1 billion better than it was at the start of the year. We had a super second quarter, and I'm very pleased with our financial results. Our second quarter comparable FFO was 22.6%-plus, better than last year's second quarter.","I'll preview what David and Mitchell are going to share with you in a few minutes. Leasing in New York is extremely active, and I believe steadily marching towards the tipping point to a landlord's market. Our New York business continues to put up very strong, industry-leading metrics.","I guess that the loss of income from the BRAC-related vacancies in Washington is the eye of the storm for our company. As Mitchell will tell you in a few minutes, we use the Patent Trade Office move-out a decade ago to totally transform Crystal City. And we will do it again. Truth be known, I am a little -- it is going a little slower than I would like. We have an enormous profit in our Washington business at the value that I believe the stock market values Washington, I would be a buyer rather than a seller of that business all day long.","At the very core leasing is our business. Companywide, we leased 1.33 million square feet in the quarter -- in the second quarter in -- or 174 transactions with positive mark-to-market of 6.0% cash and 11.9% GAAP. In the first half, we leased 3.46 million square feet in 349 separate transactions, with positive mark-to-market of 6.8% cash and 15.4% GAAP.","As for dispositions, so far in 2013, we have sold 1.2 billion of non-core assets resulting in an aggregate net gain of $297 million. This on top of $1.7 billion of non-core assets sold in 2012, which produce an aggregate net gain of $454 million.","In the second quarter alone, we closed on the sale of 12 assets with proceeds of $586 million and net gain of $65 million, specifically: LNR for $241 million; the plant in San Jose, California for $203 million; the Philadelphia market's retail property for $60 million; our 50% interest in the Downtown Crossing, Boston site for $45 million; and 8 other retail assets for $37 million.","So far in the third quarter, we have closed on the sale of Shops on Lake in Pasadena for $34 million and another small non-core strip shopping center. We are under contract to sell the Harlem Park land for $65 million, and we are currently in the market with another $500 million-plus of assets.","We continue to focus on the value-creating opportunities we have internally, such as: the redevelopment of the 725,000 square foot 330 West 34th Street building, which is coming out of service to be repositioned for creative class and technology tenants; the Marriott Marquis retail signage project in Times Square, which is going into construction in the fourth quarter; the Springfield Mall renovation, which is under construction and on schedule for a holiday 2014 opening; the transformation of 280 Park Avenue at 4eighth Street, which is also under construction and will be completed; new full block front grand lobby at all in the third quarter of 2014; the 699-unit residential project with Whole Foods at its base in Pentagon City, which will go into construction in the fourth quarter; and the Hotel Pennsylvania and 220 Central Park South site; and of course, liquefying Toys, JCPenney and LXB.","We are excited about a couple of important internal harvesting transactions that are now getting very, very close. It is my view that we are in an economy that is now growing and which will inevitably pick up speed.","With us today is Stephen Theriot, our new Chief Financial Officer, in the saddle for 73 days now. Steve comes to us from Deloitte & Touche where he did a 5-year rotation a few years ago as our audit partner, so we know him very well. Steve has a deep institutional knowledge of our company and our people, all the technical skills and great judgment. He will represent us very effectively with our shareholders, analysts, financial counter-parties and clients. You will all get to meet him personally in the very near future. And of course, Joe Macnow is also with us in the room today.","Now I'll turn it over to Steve to cover our financials.","Stephen W. Theriot","Thank you, Steve. Before I dive into the highlights of a real strong quarter, I want to say how pleased I am to be part of the great team here at Vornado. It is an honor to lead the world-class financial organization built by Joe Macnow. I look forward to meeting all of you who own our shares and who follow our company.","Turning to the quarter, yesterday we reported comparable funds from operations of $1.30 per share versus $1.06 for the prior year's second quarter, a 22.6% increase. Total FFO was $1.25 per share versus $0.89 for the prior year second quarter, a 40.4% increase.","Please see our press release or the overview and MD&A on Page 42 of our Form 10-Q for a summary of the noncomparable items. Comparable EBITDA was $418.6 million, ahead of last year's second quarter by $40.9 million, or 10.8%. Our New York division, our largest business, produced $235.7 million of comparable EBITDA, which is $28.2 million or 13.6% ahead of last year's second quarter. Our Washington business produced $84.8 million of comparable EBITDA, which is $6.1 million behind last year's second quarter, primarily due to the effects of BRAC move-outs and the sluggish leasing environment in Washington. Washington's year-to-date comparable EBITDA is $15.8 million behind last year's first 6 months and is above the range of EBITDA diminution of $5 million to $15 million we had previously projected for the full year. We expect the reduction in Washington's EBITDA in the first half of the year and the expected further reduction in the third quarter, will be partially offset by an increase in the fourth quarter. We now estimate that Washington's full year 2013 EBITDA will be approximately $10 million to $15 million lower than 2012.","Our strips and malls business produced $53.9 million of comparable EBITDA this quarter, which is $1.6 million ahead of last year's second quarter. Excluding $1.5 million of non-recurring expenses in the current quarter, the strips and malls were $3.1 million or a very strong 5.8% ahead of last year's second quarter.","Our New York and Washington businesses together with the retail properties account for approximately 90% of our company's EBITDA. Our remaining comparable EBITDA comes from the 3.5 million square foot Merchandise Mart property, anchored by Motorola Mobility, Google and the 1.8 million square foot 555 California Street office complex in San Francisco, as well as our real estate fund.","Now let me spend a minute on noncomparable items, which aggregated to a loss of $10.8 million this quarter, as compared to a loss of $34.4 million in the same quarter last year. It's a short list of items.","We recorded a negative $25.1 million of noncash noncomparable FFO this quarter, representing our share of the loss of the seasonal Toys business. As we noted in our 2012 Annual Report, based on current conditions, our accounting is asymmetrical, recognizing our share of Toys' noncash losses but as of now, not recognizing our share of noncash income. This will have the effect of reducing our GAAP carrying value.","The mark-to-market of our JCPenney derivative position produced $9.1 million of noncomparable income this quarter based on the June 30 closing price of JCPenney's common stock. Finally, the $8.1 million profit on the redemption in May of all of the outstanding Series D-15 preferred units that had an aggregate face amount of $45 million is also included in noncomparable items.","And with that, I'll turn it over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business.","David R. Greenbaum","Steve, welcome aboard, and thank you. Good morning to everyone. I'm going to begin today with a brief overview of what we're seeing here in the New York marketplace. I think one of the brokerage houses in its latest monthly report got it precisely right: Over the past 3 months, the market, as they said, has been \"warming up.\" Manhattan leasing activity increased significantly in the second quarter to 6.7 million square feet, with leasing activity for the first half of the year 11% higher than the first half of 2012. The Midtown submarket, in particular, has warmed up the most, with leasing activity 17.6% higher than last year.","Despite many large blocks coming to the market, absorption in the Midtown in the second quarter was flat to positive, reversing some of the negative 1 million square feet in the first quarter. We are finding there is good depth to the market with tenants, including financial services, media, technology, advertising and law firms, all active in the market and closing transactions. Creative class tenants and technology firms continue to be the driving force behind Midtown South activity, including most notably, 100,000 square foot lease we signed with Facebook at our 770 Broadway. More on that later in my remarks.","Value space continues to be a strong market theme. And in a positive sign, we have seen a reduction in sublease space. Midtown Class A sublease space now is at its lowest level in a year. For example, at our 2 million square foot 1290 Sixth Avenue, where AXA put some 300,000-plus square feet on the sublease market had very aggressive pricing, the speed with which they were able to sublease the space and the quality of the tenants that took the space: Morgan Stanley; Sirius XM Radio; and R\u00e9my Martin; reflected both the aggressive pricing but also importantly, the quality of the transformation we undertook at this asset.","With the cheaper sublease space clearing the market, we should begin to see some upward pressure on rents. We are also seeing a strong pickup in high-end space. In our own portfolio in the second quarter, we signed 3 leases at 280 Park Avenue, 1 in the tower for 30,000 square feet at starting rents of $115-plus, and 2 in the base of the building for a total of 100,000 square feet at starting rents in the $90s. We have 4 $100-plus leases out in the tower at 350 Park Avenue, and we have very good activity in the tower at 330 Madison Avenue.","In the second quarter, we signed 45 leases for a total of 546,000 square feet of activity taking our leasing year-to-date to 1,455,000 square feet. Importantly, of the 546,000 square feet leased in this quarter, some 250,000 square feet, 45 -- 46% of our activity came from tenants new to, or expanding in New York. That's a great sign, real growth in our marketplace. Our average starting rent this quarter was a healthy $68.76, with very strong positive mark-to-markets, a 15.8% GAAP and 10.2% cash. The average lease term was 7.3 years, and TIs and leasing commissions were 10.4% of starting rents.","At quarter end, our occupancy rate declined by a scanned 10 basis points to 95.9%. We have recovered more than that over just this past week, having signed a lease with a media technology company, Rocket Fuel, filling 50,000 square feet of vacancy at 100 West 33rd Street.","The second quarter leasing activity was highlighted by our 100,000 square foot lease with Facebook at 770 Broadway, the headquarters for both AOL and J.Crew. I'm really proud of my leasing team getting this deal done.","After an extensive search, including several new builds, Facebook leased the entire eighth floor and a portion of the seventh floor, which were previously occupied by Nielsen. The deal was complicated and an example of what we do every day to create value in the portfolio. The overall transaction involved 5 different tenants, 16 legal documents and was finalized in 23 days.","Let me give you a flavor. Nielsen had 2 years remaining on its lease and came to us with a proposed subtenant for one of its floors at 50% of Nielsen's rent. We knew that Facebook was out in the marketplace looking for space in Midtown South, and immediately reached out to Facebook to pitch the space.","We agreed upon deal terms with Facebook within 1 week of our first meeting at the building. We then entered into a recaptured transaction with Nielsen for not only the one floor they had come to us with but also a second floor. In the end, we turned the Nielsen $52 rent into a new Facebook $72 rent while Nielsen will pay us approximately $4.5 million to be released from its lease obligation. We also made a short-term deal for 60,000 square feet of the remaining space on the seventh floor with High 5 Games, which allows for perfect expansion space for Facebook.","Facebook's West Coast brokers took notice of how we executed on this complicated deal and it was the same brokers who, in fact, brought us Rocket Fuel with 50,000 square-foot lease we just completed at 100 West 33rd Street.","Other highlights of the quarter include a tech lease and health care lease, both at One Penn Plaza, with Symantec and ValueOptions taking about 45,000 square feet at rents north of $60 a foot. Symantec moved from the Grand Central submarket, continuing the tech migration to Penn Plaza. Also, at 909 Third Avenue, the Interpublic Group continued to expand, taking another 10,000 square feet, adding to their existing 221,000.","Our office explorations for the remainder of 2013 are quite modest, with only 188,000 square feet expiring, which excludes the 238,000 square feet expiring at 330 West 34th Street that will be coming out of service for a redevelopment. As Steve mentioned at 330 West, we will be repositioning the entire 725,000 square foot building for creative class and technology tenants that are migrating to Penn Plaza.","For 2014, we have some 1 million square feet expiring. I must say that our pipeline of potential tenants is very, very active. We're in serious dialogues with new tenants as well as tenants in our portfolio seeking expansion space for a total of about 750,000 square feet. And additionally, we are working on over 1 million of square feet of renewals.","Let me turn now to Manhattan street retail. Rents in all of the key corridors where we are owners continue to rise significantly. Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue, Times Square, Penn Station and SoHo. With our upcoming lease explorations at both 640 Fifth Avenue and 608 Fifth Avenue, we can expect remarkable rent increases at these properties.","At the Marriott Marquis full block front at 1535 Broadway, 45th to 46th Streets, directly across from our 1540 Broadway Forever 21 property, we will commence the redevelopment of both the retail and signage program in the fourth quarter of this year.","New York's record 52 million annual visitors continues to boost performance at the Hotel Pennsylvania. Second quarter occupancy was essentially full at 97.5%, resulting in a 7% increase in RevPAR compared to the second quarter of last year.","Turning to the 3.5 million square foot Chicago Merchandise Mart building, this quarter, we leased 98,000 feet, including a 32,000 square foot expansion by Motorola\/Google, which now leases 605,000 square feet at the Mart. Occupancy at the Mart building is now 95%.","Let me conclude my remarks by summarizing the entire New York division. We had a very strong quarter. Our key performance metrics are industry-leading with office mark-to-market rent increases of 15.8% GAAP and same-store EBITDA increases for the overall division of 8.8% cash, and 4.4% GAAP.","Isolating just the New York office business, our same-store EBITDA increased 10.4% cash and 5.4% GAAP.","Let me turn over the call now to Mitchell to review Washington.","Mitchell N. Schear","Thanks, David, and good morning, everybody. I will start with a quick overview of the second quarter and then talk more broadly about the market and how we think our -- think about our business specifically.","For the second quarter, we leased about what we did in the first quarter, 275,000 square feet in 47 transactions at a healthy average starting rent of $43.10. We generated a GAAP mark-to-market of positive 2.8%, and our cash mark-to-market was down by 1.1%. Overall, our occupancy was down 20 basis points from the first quarter to 83.6%, which is penalized by Skyline's 54.8% occupancy.","Excluding Skyline, our overall occupancy was better, 89.2%. Our tenant improvements in leasing commissions for leases signed in the quarter were 12.8% of starting rents, 80 basis points higher than in 2012, which is the trend in the D.C. market today.","In Crystal City in the second quarter, we leased 108,000 square feet in 18 deals at a very respectable initial rent of $44.10, generating a GAAP mark-to-market of positive 3.8%, and a cash mark-to-market of positive 0.5%. Our 2,400-unit apartment business in Arlington and Georgetown is 97.1% occupied, and second quarter EBITDA is 3.8% ahead of last year's second quarter.","Now let me turn to what we hear, read and what we see firsthand in the marketplace. The Washington economy is beginning to show some signs of recovery. Economists are projecting solid job growth in the professional and business services sector of about 20% between 2013 and 2017. We are encouraged by those projections. While the current real estate market in the Washington area continues to be tepid, we have begun to see positive absorption, albeit slight, in the first half of 2013 in contrast to the negative absorption for all of 2012.","Much of the activity we're seeing is of the musical chairs variety, with tenants moving to get a better deal; in some cases, actually expanding and in other cases, still finding ways to get more efficient and use less space than before. Our belief is that the D.C. economy -- as the D.C. economy continues to recover and as the projected new jobs emerge, the office market will follow with real absorption and declining vacancies. We still expect that the balance of 2013 will be sluggish, with activity beginning to pick up in 2014.","It is important to remember that Washington is still Washington. We are one of the top markets in the country. We have the most educated workforce in the country, where 47.5% have a bachelor's or an advanced degree. And we have a growing private sector, and along with that, we have high-paying jobs, strong housing and low unemployment of 5.6%. We've dealt with large move-outs before, and we've always come out better in the end. Each time, we have made vast improvements to Crystal City overall. We have repositioned buildings, we've added amenities, changed the tenant base and ultimately, created more value.","In the last 10 years, Crystal City rents have increased by more than 30%. Our unbelievable location next to the airport on the shores of the Potomac River remains just that, an unbelievable location.","In Skyline, as has been rumored in the press, very shortly, we expect to sign a 182,700 square foot new lease with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service who will move into Skyline Technology Center in mid-2014. This building was fully vacated by BRAC in late 2011. This hotly contested lease with highly competitive terms will be one of the largest leases to be signed in an existing building in Northern Virginia this year.","With this lease, we will taking care of over 54% of the 2 million square feet of BRAC space that has expired to date. And we will reduce our remaining BRAC exposure by 12% portfolio-wide and increase our occupancy at the Skyline complex by 6.9% to 61.7%.","Fish and Wildlife will join Analytic Services who moved into 88,000 square feet earlier this year.","We're applying the same focus to all of our BRAC impacted space. We are finding more than ever that speed matters. An example of our speed-to-market happened at 1777 North Kent Street in Rosslyn, which sits in a prime location directly across the Potomac River from the Kennedy Center.","In late January of this year, the Department of Defense moved out of the entirety of the building. By June, we completed full renovation; new lobby, new systems, et cetera. And by July, we moved the Corporate Executive Board into 108,000 square feet. So within 180 days, this BRAC building was back in action with a new type of tenant and some of the best views in Washington. Over 150 brokers were recently there to see the renovation, and those views from the top floors of the building, which are still available.","In addition to executing new leases, we are retaining our tenants. We just signed a major lease renewal with the global law firm Sidley Austin, for 289,000 square feet at The Investment Building. This is a property that we manage, lease and own a 5% interest in partnership with institutional investors advised by JPMorgan. Sidley's lease was set to expire in 2016, but we extended them through mid-2031 in a slightly expanded square footage envelope. In the market where law firms are shrinking, and generally moving into new spaces, Sidley will use swing space in our building while they renovate in place to make the space work better for them now and well into the future.","Leasing is the main event for me, and our entire team. We recently hired Bruce Pascal, hands down the best landlord broker in the D.C. area. Bruce will partner with Jim Creedon, who has worked closely with me for 10 years, to strengthen our already powerful leasing team. Bruce has 25 years experience with CBRE, and in 2012, he was one of the top 25 CBRE brokers worldwide. He has a big presence in the Washington leasing community, and he's extremely well respected and extraordinarily talented. Bruce started last week and has hit the ground running.","It's important to mention that we recently received government approval to build a 699-unit residential project in Pentagon City, with the Whole Foods at its base. This new project fits on land that we already owned free and clear and is the first of 3 side-by-side projects that will ultimately total 2,100 units. The location is unbeatable. It's a mere 5-iron from Simon's Pentagon City Mall, which by the way, we own a 7.5% interest in.","We expect to deliver the first apartments in mid-2016 and project an incremental yield of 7-plus percent on the estimated $235 million we will spend for this project.","Washington is a strong rental apartment market, especially for high-quality, amenity-rich, transit-served, urban product, all of which are the attributes of this new project.","I'd like to thank you and now turn it over to Joe Macnow.","Joseph Macnow","Thank you, Mitchell. Let me first touch on our strip shopping centers and malls, both of which had a strong quarter. Strip shopping center occupancy was 94.1% at quarter end, up 20 basis points from the first quarter and 20 basis points from last year's second quarter.","Occupancy at the malls was 93.5%, again up 20%, 20 basis points from the first quarter, and 40 basis points from last year's second quarter. We leased 256,000 square feet at the strip shopping centers with a positive mark-to-market of 18% GAAP and 10.3% cash. We leased 135,000 square feet at the malls, with a positive mark-to-market of 11.1% GAAP and 6.3% cash. The combination of solid trade area incomes, strategic, hard barrier-to-entry locations and strong anchors continues to drive leasing at both the strips and the malls.","At Springfield Town Center, Steve mentioned our major mall redevelopment in Northern Virginia. Construction is on schedule for a late 2014 opening, and it is leasing well.","Turning to capital markets. As of today, we have $3.5 billion in liquidity, comprised of $1.1 billion of cash, $2.4 billion of undrawn revolving credit facilities. Overall, $1 billion better than at the start of last year. $1 billion better than 12\/31\/12.","Our consolidated debt-to-enterprise value was 36.4%, and our consolidated debt-to-EBITDA is 7x. In June, we completed a $550 million refinancing of the Independence Plaza residential complex in Tribeca, in which we own a 50% interest. This interest-only loan is at 3.48% and has a 5-year term. The net proceeds of $219 million, after repaying the existing $323 million mortgage and closing costs, were distributed to the partners, of which our share was $137 million.","During the second quarter, we redeemed all of our outstanding 6 7\/8% Series D-15 preferred units for $36.9 million or an $8.1 million discount, which, as Steve Theriot mentioned, is a component of noncomparable FFO. We also repaid $149 million of mortgages, which had a weighted average interest rate of 6.69%, and was scheduled to mature later this year on the Broadway Mall, 2231 Crystal Drive and 1225 Clark Street. We used existing cash, which is earning 0 to repay these loans, adding these properties to our highly -- high-quality unencumbered asset pool and saving $10 million of interest annually. We continue to negotiate with the special servicer to restructure the terms of the Skyline mortgage loan, which has a June 30 balance of $725.6 million, including accrued deferred interest of $47.6 million.","Our debt mix is balanced, with 86.5% fixed rate with a weighted average rate of 5.04%, at 13.5% floating with a weighted average interest rate of 2.35%. Of our $10 billion of consolidated debt, $1.4 billion is unsecured, $84 million is outstanding under the -- our $2.5 billion of revolving credit agreements, and the balance consists of nonrecourse mortgage loans. Our debt maturity is a well added, with only $177 million maturing in the remainder of this year and $236 million maturing next year.","We remained committed to maintain a strong investment-grade rating. We received ratings affirmations with stable outlooks from both Fitch BBB in June, and Moody's Baa2 in July.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I don't know it if this is for Joe or for Mitchell, but obviously, you guys are making progress with this Fish and Wildlife deal. I guess I'm trying to take that comment and the leasing that you're doing down there with Joe's comment about the special servicing. I noticed that you guys also broke out some of the leasing stats, kind of x Skyline. And I guess I'm just trying to put together, how do you lease and market a project that's still in special servicing? And how do you guys think about the economics if you don't really know kind of what the debt restructuring looks like?","Stephen W. Theriot","Steve, it's Steve. We do know what the negotiation with the second -- the special servicer will end up in. We've been -- Wendy Silverstein, who's here in the room, has been working on it for quite some time now. It's fairly baked. It's just not ready for publication because the deal isn't completely finalized. But we do know. The arrangement will allow us to infuse the capital that's necessary to release that building in approximately the middle of the capital stock of the loan where we think we have a secure interest. The long and the short of it is, after analysis, it's fairly clear to our management team that we would rather renegotiate the loan. And by the way, the lender would also rather have us stay in and operate the property and lease up the property that there will be more value created than, so to speak, giving back the keys right now. So that's where we are.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And do you have a sense, Steve, for when that will become public?","Stephen W. Theriot","Wendy, what do you think?","Wendy Silverstein","I think 2 to 3 months to do the documents.","Stephen W. Theriot","Wendy says 2 to 3 months to do the documents, but that's sort of speculating. We have a good relationship with the special service, and we've been in dialogue with them for a fairly long time. We have a handshake on the structure of the deal, and we believe we will conclude that deal.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just to kind of follow up on Springfield Mall. I don't know if that's for Joe, or for Mitchell. Could you guys just give us maybe an update on kind of the progress, what you spend today, kind of where you are in the leasing? And how do we think about the return on that asset, maybe by 2015?","Stephen W. Theriot","My guys are looking at me. So I'll answer that question, also. The leasing is progressing well. The -- we divide the leasing into 3 categories. Mall shops is one category. The restaurant offering, which is very important for this property and for all major regional malls, is the second. And then many anchors, such as Dick's, the theater, et cetera, is the third. We're well along with the many anchors. We're almost completed with the restaurant offerings. And we are well more than 50% committed for the mall shop section of 450,000 square feet. Most importantly, with respect to the mall shop section, we are either signed or in lease draft with a dozen very important lead tenants, which are the core to a successful mall. So we're more than satisfied with the leasing progress. In terms of returns, I think that was also in your question, Steve. Our pro forma is that on the incremental money that we will be investing, which is I think -- what's our last disclosed number, $230 million?","Joseph Macnow","$225 million.","Stephen W. Theriot","I have a 200 -- I have $230 million in my head, so Joe says $225 million, and I'm sure he's right. We are budgeting a low double-digit return, okay? So on the increment. So that's pretty satisfactory. On the -- if you combine that number with the sum cost of our previous investment in the land together with its carry, that number goes down to, give or take, 6%.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Steve, you mentioned in your opening comments that based on the value that the stock market is valuing D.C., adding your stock price, that you would be a buyer rather than a seller of that business all day long. And so I'm curious just with the extremely strong execution on the asset sale front, the enormous liquidity that you have today that is only expected to grow in the future. Should we expect that as Chairman of the Board and CEO of the company that you recommend that company go down the road of a share repurchase program? Because I'm assuming that D.C is not the only misvalued piece of the company that you perceive in the company.","Steven Roth","We consider share repurchases, I won't say at every board meeting, but at many board meetings, and we have not heretofore decided to launch a share repurchase program. By the way, thank you. We -- for your acknowledging. We are happy with our asset disposition program. It will continue apace. We are happy with our cash position, and it will also continue to grow.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.","Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You mentioned about $500 million plus in the -- in sort of the forward pipeline of asset sales. Can you get a little more specific and give us some sense of either assets, or the nature of what's in the offer there?","Stephen W. Theriot","I don't think so, Anthony. They are principally retail assets. A couple of them are troubled. A couple of them are terrific. But out of our main core geography, but I don't really want at this point to get into the details of the -- or which assets they are or what our price expectations are. But we will complete this cycle, and then we'll fill in with another cycle right on top of it.","Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When you mean that cycle, do you mean sort of the next couple of quarters?","Stephen W. Theriot","Well, we have more assets to sell.","Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and just another question. Your 2014 and 2015 lease expirations get a little bit heavier than maybe the last couple of years. Can you comment on where the current mark-to-market stands? I know there's a hefty one in the retail area, but just more broadly provide some color on that?","Stephen W. Theriot","Well, I couldn't do that. Can anybody else in the room do that? So if -- as I understand your question, Anthony, is what's the mark-to-market and the current mark-to-market in the lease expirations in 2014 and '15? We'll have to get that back to you with that. I can only tell you with respect to the retail acquisitions, I think, David, what was the word you used?","David R. Greenbaum","Remarkable. Pretty remarkable at Fifth Avenue.","Stephen W. Theriot","They're remarkable. So anyway, Anthony, I'm embarrassed I can't give you that off my head. Nobody else in the room can either. We'll get back to you.","Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I mean, maybe just to ask slightly differently way: In New York, for instance, your quarterly spreads were pretty good. They're positive. Is that fairly indicative of where the portfolio stands right now, if market rents for the flat line? Or was this an anomaly?","Stephen W. Theriot","Let me reword your question in another way. If we were to argue and then empty the portfolio and rerent it, we have a positive mark-to-market on the entire portfolio, certainly in New York office. With -- and remarkably in New York retail. With respect to Washington, as you've seen from the numbers, even though leasing is sluggish and soft, the pricing is holding up. So I would say that in Washington as well, in the current market as we see it, we have at least a push on the mark-to-market for the entire portfolio. And on the non-Manhattan retail, we also have fairly decent, probably give or take 10% or so mark-to-market and all that. By the way, the interesting thing about the -- you can't really do that on the strips and malls because a lot of that is anchored tenants with very long-term leases. So it's a very theoretical calculation. We can't really get our hands on those assets, normally speaking.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Steve or David, I'm curious, your thoughts on what's required or how much further we have to go until we reach that tipping point in New York where it does become a landlord's market? Are we -- how close are we?","Stephen W. Theriot","I'll answer, and then David will answer. My answer is about 200 to 300 basis points more in the vacancy rate, going down into the high single digits from the low double digits.","David R. Greenbaum","Yes, I think that's a fair comment. I mean, as you look at availability around the city right now, it's in kind of the low double digits, about 12%, which is the vacancy plus available space; space that's going to be available over the next 12 months. I think we need some decent absorption to get those numbers down into the 9% range, plus\/minus, at which point in time, we begin to see much more strength in the market. As I said, to me, a very positive sign this past quarter was pushing out, as I call it, sometimes barfing out some of the sublease space at cheap pricing, which just clears the market, enabling the direct space to achieve and really float to market pricing.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","But, Michael, let's look at it in a slightly different way. There is not one homogeneous market for space in Manhattan. There are multiple -- as you know, multiple submarkets and geographies, and then there's also multiple types of space. So for example, the tech-tight marketplaces, which are Downtown, Midtown South, Park Avenue South, et cetera, are basically full with rents which are rising. Would you say rapidly or just rising, David?","David R. Greenbaum","I would say, at that this point in time, probably rising. And I think there was an enormous rise in rents at this point in time. They're still rising, but the...","Stephen W. Theriot","Oh, so that type of space, for example, our 770 Broadway building and others' broad building and now coming in and pushing into Penn Plaza is in short supply, has already benefited from a supply-demand imbalance and has already risen and is continuing to rise. As David says in his remarks, high-end space in Midtown and the Plaza district -- Park Avenue district, et cetera, is in -- is also in short supply. Those kinds of users are growing. They're doing very well. They have a demand for space, and we're enjoying that. I mean, for example, at 280 Park Avenue, which we own in partnership with SL Green. And I think either Mark or Dirrell said this on their call, our strategy there is likely to lease that space out floor by floor or 2 floors at a time to smaller, well, and actually the large, but the smaller space using financial services, and there is good demand for that. If there is a softness in the marketplace, it's in the big blocks. And so we have the dynamics of the new builds over at Hudson Yards and Wall Street and down at the World Trade Center. And so 300,000, 500,000 foot blocks are a totally different kind of demand, and softer than what I've just mentioned. And we don't -- we -- I don't think we have one of those. So we're in pretty good shape. And anyway, so the -- what I'm trying to say is the market can be looked like as a homogeny. You have to take it apart geography by geography and user group by user group. I hope that answers.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. And then second question would just be curious if there's any update on 220 Central Park South or any comment on press reports about your involvement in 650 Madison?","Stephen W. Theriot","Those are 2 different questions. Let me do 6 -- 220 Central Park South first. So as we said many times, we have -- it's a wonderful site in the front row of -- with Park Avenue views, et cetera. the most sought-after space, the space that has benefited from apartments selling at $5,000, $6,000, $7,000, $8,000 and even higher a square foot. Interestingly, the Park Lane went under contract 2 weeks ago, I think it was. At $650 million for that site, it's a teardown. And if you add the cost of vacating the building and the cost of the demolition, it's more like $750 million, which equates to $3,000 a zoning square foot. And interestingly, our basis in our site, which is now 326,000 square feet, is a $1,000 a foot. So we think we have a -- I think the word of day is remarkable, so I'll use that work again -- a remarkable profit in just the land. With respect to the other issues with that site, we don't have -- I don't have anything more to say about the other issues of that site. With respect to 650 Madison, that was your second question, Michael?","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's right.","Stephen W. Theriot","It's a fine property. It's a fairly modern building as opposed to the park -- the Madison Avenue buildings, which are -- have a different kind of context. This is a modern-ish kind of building. It's on Madison, the full block front between 59th and 60th. It's a fine asset in a fine location. Recently, we and Oxford Properties, an affiliate of the Ontario pension fund, joined 2 existing partners in the general partnership. So we have 1\/4 of the general partnership, as does the other 3 partners. Our investment is $12.5 million. We're in the process of putting together the capital structure for this deal. So I would say it's actually premature for me to say anything more about it now.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. Okay, 2 questions. One, first, a great shout out on Jim Creedon, excellent guy. I'm sure he will do a wonderful job at Crystal City. First, for David Greenbaum. What's interesting to me about the Facebook lease and the Google lease is neither of these buildings are particularly state-of-the-art. A lot of columns, very inefficient. What causes someone like Google and Facebook to go into these kind of buildings and pay pretty healthy rents?","David R. Greenbaum","You have to, John, kind of focus on the culture of these firms. It's -- I'm sitting here today with my tie on, and these guys, I don't think they've seen anyone with a tie in a long time. So I think when they walk into these properties, the idea of going into a glass new build, which, in fact, Facebook considered real hard down in Midtown South -- ultimately, the decision they made was, even though in a sense, the floor plate may be somewhat more efficient than an overbuilding, i.e., has fewer columns, from their point of view, it's just not the culture that they're all about. The building that we own is 100-plus-year-old building. It's a former department store. We did a renovation of that building about 15 years ago. And when you walk into the lot, they all will tell you, when tenants look at it, they say, \"Wow, this thing is great.\" In fact, I don't think we would do anything differently in terms of the renovation that we did 15 years ago today. The floor plates are very large. The ceiling heights are great. The windows are big. So the light and air coming into the building is great. And these guys love to be on a big horizontal footprint. Google, obviously, did that here in New York. We did the same thing with Google and Motorola in River North at the Mart. They love these big floor plate buildings, whether that enables them to take their skateboards around the floor or obviously have the ability to have people interact all day, which is what that culture is all about. I mean, you'll find when you walk into the space that much of it is going to be open-space. We're excited to see the Facebook space. In fact, it's going to be a Frank Gehry design.","Stephen W. Theriot","So let me jump on and add to what David said. Don't think for a moment that because these buildings are not brand-new steel-and-glass buildings that they are anything other than state-of-the-art in all of their services. All -- for example, in all of our buildings, the elevators are the same as you would have in a brand-new building, the mechanical systems, the Internet service, the emergency generation of power, et cetera, so that the only thing that's different than a 770 Broadway, which is the -- they want to make a department store that David just described that Facebook selected, is that it's a masonry building, which has some texture and some culture to it as opposed to a steel-and-glass building.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up question, a little more serious, is when 3 are out of service, it's almost 3 million square feet, 813,000 square feet in Crystal City; Rosslyn 170,000 square feet; Springfield Mall, 724,000 square feet, which you addressed; the strips in Northern Jersey, 6 strips 887,000 square feet; 330 West 34th Street, 258,000 square feet. There's probably a lot of value there. Do you lay that out anywhere where people can get a sense for your current booked versus anticipated further investment versus stabilized yield?","Stephen W. Theriot","Joe?","Joseph Macnow","John, it's Joe Macnow. No, when -- I'm sorry to say, we don't make it easy for you to put a real value on that. But your observation of how much is out of service and will soon hopefully be income-producing, certainly, it will be in Springfield. And David commented on 330. There's tremendous value there, and we'll consider and discuss now, putting together something to let you have a better opportunity.","But that list, John, just shows we -- our company is a large company. We have lots of internal value that we're creating, and so this is -- it's keeping us busy.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess going back to D.C. here, looking at the 10-K and the updated outlook for 2013 versus 2012, is it safe to assume you guys are thinking that 3Q '13 is now the bottom for D.C. and it goes up from here? Or is there a better way to think about it? And then also, have you changed at all your investment expectations to the dollars you expect to put to work in that market?","Steven Roth","Mitchell?","Mitchell N. Schear","So the answer with respect to the market price is that I think that, yes, we think that the third quarter will, in fact, be the -- will be the trough, and then we do expect to see positive movement. And some of the positive movements that you'll see in terms of EBITDA is really already in place, and it's recycling from where we were at a point a year ago. So it's not really speculative at all. So we will see the EBITDA grow based on contracts. And we expect to see the occupancy -- occupancies to grow as we continue to lease up. We're going to be leasing up now at a greater rate because we've really seen the preponderance of all the vacancies from BRAC, et cetera, come mostly upon us. So I think we will now sort of generally lease upward from that point. In terms of investment activity, I think that we're committed to our long-term program. We think we've got some great redevelopment opportunities and some great locations, whether it's on the offices or residential side. And at the right time, we will continue that program and put those projects forward.","Steven Roth","Jamie, it's Steve. I'll jump in on that as well. From my point of view -- and this is from headquarter's point of view as opposed to in the field, so you can take it for what it's worth -- we are clearly bouncing along the bottom in the Washington and in our Washington business. The issue really is, is what's the duration to get back to stabilized occupancy and get the lost income back. So also from my point of view, it's going slower than I would have hoped. As I said in my prepared remarks, it won't be a year, but I don't think it'll be 3 years either. So there you have it. With respect to capital allocation, it's interesting. We have an open to buy in Washington if we can find something that was a bargain, okay? So in addition to our development pipeline, which is extremely robust -- as Mitchell said, we're starting a 700-unit apartment project now -- in addition to all of the development that we're doing in Washington and repositioning of our existing assets, we do have an open to buy of new assets if we can find something that was a -- I don't want to say it crudely -- if we find something where we have fair value sort of cheap, okay? Notwithstanding the fact that the recent market in Washington is slower than we would like, we really have had trouble finding investment opportunities down there. Said another way, for well-leased buildings in Washington, the investment demand is still extremely robust. Joe, you were going to add something?","Joseph Macnow","Yes, Jamie, I want to put some math on that. If you would take the EBITDA from 2012's third and fourth quarters, that would total $169.5 million for the Washington segment. If you would take this quarter that we just finished, Q2 of '13, that's $84.8 million of EBITDA. So as long as it doesn't go down, the remaining 2 quarters would be at a running rate of $169.6 million, equivalent to last year's 2 quarters. Needless to say, because we projected between $10 million and $15 million, we expect this year's numbers to go up a little bit but not a whole lot from the running rate we now have.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. That's very helpful. And I guess, as you're thinking about 2014 and the leases that are signed, do you have a sense of what the baked in number is for EBITDA already?","Steven Roth","The question is, based upon our existing pipeline of completed leases what's the EBITDA in 2014 going to be? You're not going to project that.","Joseph Macnow","No, not yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Two project-specific questions for you. The first is down at Independence Plaza, just sort of curious -- just given the long-term upside potential on that asset, just sort of curious why you sold down a bit of your position.","Steven Roth","That was a commitment that we had made when we bought into it originally.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Is there any -- is there anymore commitment to sell any more down? Or is that the -- this was the...","Steven Roth","No, no, no. We're very happy.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, second question..","Steven Roth","Very happy with that investment, but that was a commitment that we had made that -- it was a commitment. And we...","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","That sounds fine. My second question is switching to Alexander's, just a little more color on the apartment tower, quick -- sort of your expected rents. In our numbers, it looked like you may need like $2,800 a unit to get sort of a 6% return, which would seem a little at the high end for that market, but just a bit more color what your thoughts are of where rents are for that property and sort of who the target is.","Steven Roth","I think your numbers are pretty close. We're projecting a slightly sub-$40 gross rent, which will yield a return on cost of approximately -- of something slightly more than 6%, which is pretty good in the apartment business.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And you think that market will support that?","Steven Roth","We do.","Operator","And our next question is a follow-up question from Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Steve, it's Josh Attie. Can you talk about Puerto Rico? How much occupancy you expect to lose at that asset and when and then also, what the strategy is in the debt negotiation?","Steven Roth","Well, it's a little awkward because it is in negotiation. Basically, the Montehiedra asset has deteriorated. It's a -- it's actually a well-located asset and an attractive asset, but it's under the gun of a couple of competitors that are hurting it. And so the income has deteriorated to the point where we thought it prudent to seek relief from the special servicer. Our strategy there is if we can conclude a successful negotiation with the special servicer, and Wendy is -- has a perfect score on all of these over the year so far. She's not smiling at me. I'm putting her under the gun. In any event, our strategy is to add capital to that asset and convert it to an outlet center. We have great experience at doing that in the enormously successful Bergen Mall in Bergen County, New Jersey. And towards that end, we have just concluded a deal with Nike for an outlet store in that center, which is the bell cow of the industry, so that bodes very well for our strategy. So we will add capital and redevelop and transform that asset in what we think will be very successful if we can reach a successful transaction with the special servicer. Notwithstanding all of that, this is not going to be a great, great home run financially either way.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just so that we can model the earnings properly, how much -- you mentioned an occupancy decline and tenants coming out. How much of an occupancy decline do you expect? And when should we expect that to happen?","Steven Roth","I need somebody else to help me with that.","Joseph Macnow","We'll have to get back to you, Josh, we will.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A question for Mitchell on Crystal City. The transition from government to private tenants, if you want to look at it that way, maybe just remind us of the current mix and then where you'd expect it to be, in say, a year's time?","Mitchell N. Schear","Sure. I think if you just look back historically, before we went through the last re-leasing of the patent trademark office space, which was about 2 million square feet, we were at about 85% government and government contractor, and about 15% other. As a result of that re-leasing, the numbers shifted to 2\/3, 1\/3; so 2\/3 government, government contractor and about 1\/3 other. So I think that now with government space coming available, we're probably expecting that, that mix will either stay at that number or slightly increase with more private sector users as opposed to the government and government contractors. Or said differently, I think we still believe that the government sees Crystal City as a good market. The contractors see it as a good market, not just defense contractors but contractors to other agencies in terms of its great location. And then we're also seeing an increase of other users whether it is groups that are 501c-3 nonprofits, whether it's some technology companies, et cetera, et cetera. So I think there's a whole mix a private sector that we'll expect to see re-lease the space that we have there as well.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then back on the New York City office and focusing in on the high-end versus the lower-end dynamic, both of which you want to target. Do you see even more strength at the low end, that you'd expect to expand upwards? Or are the trends pretty similar across the range?","David R. Greenbaum","No, I think what we've seen, probably the greatest increases in pricing, in fact, has been at the low-end product. We feel very good about the space we're going to be introducing to the market at 330 West 34th Street, as I talked about earlier. And I'll just remind you that we're going to be undertaking a similar program at 7 West 34th Street, which we're converting from a building that has had marked tenants to an office building. We're taking back much of that building effective January 1 with the balance of the building coming back to office over the next 2 years. So I think that space, which I consider to be relatively competitive space, probably is a space that is the most active in the marketplace for buildings that, as Steve characterized, have the infrastructure done in the buildings and can deliver absolutely modern space to tech, media types of tenants.","Steven Roth","And as we -- and both David and I have both said, we're very constructive on the pricing of that kind of space, and we have -- that's our -- that's the sweet spot of our company.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Harris with Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Let me try in fill the bold bracket void here. Steve, a question for you. If we think about life 12 months hence, do you think cap rates for your portfolio and the sort of properties that you'd be interested in acquiring would be the same, or higher or lower than where we are today?","Steven Roth","I think, David, I hope the cap rates for our properties would lower, but the cap rates for what we want to acquire are going to be higher.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Right. And in the real world, Steve?","Steven Roth","Cap rates traditionally are extremely sluggish. People think that when interest rates move steep that their cap rates are going to move similarly, they do not. And sellers are very reluctant to deal with future -- deal with the adversity of higher interest rates or what have you. So I think that -- and by the way, the market for acquisitions is very challenging if you're a buyer and very, very accommodating if you're a seller. And the acquisitions market for the best properties is being the buyers are underwriting and discounting fairly significant rent improvement and rent rises in the future. So I can't -- and I don't think it's appropriate for me to try to predict my stock price or my cap rates, but we're not terribly optimistic that cap rates are going to rise and give us, in the short term, a robust acquisitions market that we can feed on. So I, for one, think that -- don't think that interest rates are going to run away here. I don't think that they're going to rise to 5% -- that treasury is going to rise to 5%. I don't think the short rates are going to rise significantly for the next year or 2. And I think that we are benefiting from a worldwide, synchronized, I think I said in my letter, central bankers are Santa Claus, and I think they still are in the Santa Claus mood. So I don't think particularly forecast any significant trade -- change in cap rates over the next -- like a year as the time horizon.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Mike DeMarco just recently left. Are you filling the void? Or does it, in any way, represent an interruption to your sales activities?","Steven Roth","No, the opposite. I mean, Mike is a good guy. He was with us for a short number of years. The -- his most-recent assignment was to handle the sale process of the -- of most of the Merchandise Mart assets, and as well, he was the team captain on selling the 2 big malls that we sold at the end of last year, at the beginning of this year. Albeit, that was such a significant transaction. The entire senior team, including me and Mike, and we were really involved in that. So Mike completed his task, and it was time for him to move on. We have staff headed by our existing senior management team, Michael Franco, Wendy Silverstein, et cetera. Plus all of the -- all of our platform heads get involved in these things. So we have plenty of buyers, and we have plenty of sellers. Mike's a good guy. I think he's got a good new position, and his task with us was finished.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My questions have been answered.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Steve, I think earlier in the call, you made a comment in your prepared remarks about some harvesting that was on the horizon. Is there any more color on that? Or was that part of the $500 million of sales that you have out in the market? Or was that referring to something else?","Steven Roth","No, that was referring to a couple of other situations, which are large and important, and David's -- we're going to go back to David's remarkable word, which we're not -- we just can't preannounce. We're hopeful that we'll conclude these deals shortly, but we can't really speculate about them. But when we do, they'll be fun.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","All right. Well, we look forward to that. Just one other question if I could. Curious on the decision to spend redevelopment capital on 300 West 34th. I'm curious if it's an offensive decision because Penn Station, Penn Plaza is doing so well, or whether it's a defensive move ahead of Hudson Yards coming online in the next several years and presenting additional competition to the west.","Steven Roth","David, you want to do that?","David R. Greenbaum","We look at it as an offensive situation. It's a building that has been the headquarters for a city government agency for upwards now of 20-plus years. The city finally took this agency. We've been trying to get this agency out of the building, in fact, over the last decade. The agency is finally now moving to Brooklyn, so we saw this is an opportunity to basically take this asset and aggressively and proactively attract the kind of tenants that we think are attracted today to Penn Plaza. As I said, the migrating tenants, which are the tech and the media tenants. So we are excited about this opportunity.","Steven Roth","We all are -- you mentioned Hudson Yards, so let me jump on that for a second. Actually, what is going on at Hudson Yards, as you know, we are friendly with the developer. We are partners with the developer, and we know their team very well as they know ours. The Hudson Yards situation is an enormous plus for our company. The activity that Hudson Yards has created and the -- what they are doing is they are basically in front of every large tenant in the City of New York in an attempt to move them to Hudson Yards in their new builds. And so that activity has created a shift in market perceptions as to the west side of Manhattan, which, as we've said many times before, the city government and the planning community of New York has focused at as the next growth area. So since Penn Plaza is basically the same location as Hudson Yards, except they're on the river outward, sort of the Canary Wharf kind of a thing; and we are in board on top of Penn Station and adjacent to the enormous, the most important department store in America, Macy's, et cetera. So we benefit enormously from the activity that's being created around Hudson Yards. And we are rooting mightily for its success. Next point is, their price point right now is $30 above our price point, okay? So that gives us a huge umbrella under which to operate, and we are experiencing that their price point is sucking out our price point up, which is very good. The next part of it is, they're catering to the 300,000-, 500,000-, 700,000-foot customer. We do not. We cater to the 50,000-, 100,000-foot customer. So all things about Hudson Yards, we think accrues to our benefit. And as I said, we're rooting for them enormously. And the 330 West 34th Street is just another bow -- arrow in our quiver of supplying product into a growing and dynamic tech, media, et cetera marketplace.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","So is there going to be additional projects like that in the rest of your Penn Plaza concentration? Or is that sort of a unique situation?","Steven Roth","The answer is, is that internally in our planning sessions, we aspire to add capital to Penn Plaza because we think that may very well be the single most important place and the single most profitable place that we can invest capital to drive that marketplace where we're the dominant owner and to drive rents in that marketplace and to deliver better product to our customers. So the answer to that is yes, we're excited about the prospects of improving and adding capital to that district.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Oh, I'm so sorry. Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Steve, hopefully, I didn't miss this. Is there any thought of putting the San Francisco assets on the market given that -- I guess, is it a core market still for you guys given you have limited exposure there?","Steven Roth","We have no -- we've said this publicly before. We have no current intention to expand in San Francisco, so I think that answers the second question. And the third question is it's a -- I mean, to answer your other question, it's a grand asset. It stands majestically in the Skyline. We know that there has been some movement in the tech, as in New York by the way, the tech market place is moving away, but the Bank of America building is still the Bank of America building. And while I'm not going to say it's for sale, I'm not going to say it's not for sale.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I know that Mike DeMarco left you guys a little earlier this year to go over to Cantor Fitzgerald. How have you shuffled up his prior responsibilities in light of, I guess, Fascitelli's departure as well? How have things sort of reshuffled in the executive ranks because of the -- DeMarco's loss?","Steven Roth","I think as I said before, we have Michael Franco and Wendy Silverstein, the coheads of our acquisitions an and capital market group, are responsible -- as they were, by the way, when Mike was here -- for the sales process. And by the way, the sales of important assets around here gets everybody involved, including David if it's a David asset, Mitchell, the retail people. Everybody gets involved, even the financial people. Everybody gets a knee. Everybody gets involved in important sales.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right. If I can a quickie here. On Toys \"R\" Us ...","Steven Roth","What I'm saying is we don't want for management to handle it around here, but I think -- I don't want to boast about it, but we think we have the best senior management team in the business.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate it. On toys, given how strong the environment has been of late for demand for big boxes, and there's clearly a lack of supply in that business today, have you guys rethought whether it makes sense that some of those toy stores are worth more dead than alive? Is that a conversation that's getting revisited?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is, yes. But it's a much more complex question than that. How do you extricate those boxes? Well, the first question is how do you extricate those boxes and still maintain a viable toys business. The second is how do you extricate them from the capital structure, et cetera. And so I assume what you're talking about is sale leaseback as opposed to just closing the stores and selling them out. Because that's not in our thinking right now. But the answer...","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Or I mean, finding a way to monetize it through the real estate.","Steven Roth","Yes. The answer is, we think about that all the time.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Anything imminent in your mind? Or it's sort of an ongoing thought?","Steven Roth","It's an ongoing thought, which we don't have anything to say about right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. Just want to come back to Penn Plaza and sort of, Steve, your comments on Hudson Yards, putting the hotel redevelopment -- Hotel Penn redevelopment aside, have you brushed off any sort of your plans to build new in that market given: a, your competitive position next to transit versus what Related is trying to do with Hudson Yards, what Brookfield's trying to do on Ninth Avenue?","Steven Roth","I think we have -- how many -- what's the footage that we own there now?","David R. Greenbaum","About 8 million feet.","Steven Roth","We have more than 8 million, somewhere between 8 million and 9 million feet extent at a basis, which is -- which would knock your socks off, okay? So our primary focus is to create value and increase the value and increase the incomes, et cetera, in the existing product. The new builds, we've decided -- we've already announced and we've already decided that it doesn't make any economic sense currently to take down the Hotel Pennsylvania and build an office building. We have, from time to time, including recently, considered taking down that hotel and put forth apartments, which is really the highest and best use for every square inch of new development in Manhattan anywhere. So our primary focus is on our existing buildings, and we are -- we have no imminent announcement of a new build in the Penn Plaza district.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The $3.4 million of acquisition-related cost, how much of that is 650 Madison versus other transactions?","Joseph Macnow","[indiscernible]","Steven Roth","Say it out loud.","Joseph Macnow","Michael, that's all the fees related to underwriting buildings. 650 Madison will be part of that, absolutely, but there are others.","Steven Roth","But those are dead deal costs.","Joseph Macnow","Not dead deals costs. They're deal costs. All deal costs get expensed, dead or alive.","Steven Roth","Capitalized, I think. Can you be more specific as to what that $3.4 million is?","Joseph Macnow","No, we'll have to get back. Michael, if you want more detail, we'll have the get back to you.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, I know. It just -- it seems like a -- just, Steve, given your comments about the acquisition market and pricing being a seller, I guess $3.4 million seem like a big number, and I recognize the cap structure and investment at 650 Madison is still moving around, but $12.4 million is not a lot of capital. $3.4 million relative to that seems like a lot. So I'm just trying to put things together and really understand the company, sort of what they're really -- what you're really doing on the acquisition front, and how active you want to be in where you're spending the money, effectively.","Steven Roth","The fact is that 650 Madison would be a minor part of that $3.5 million or $3.4 million, number one. Number two is we look at everything as we have to, as you would expect us to. So the answer is we're going to get the detail of that number and get back to you.","Operator","We will have questions from John Guinee and Alexander Goldfarb. Our first question comes from John Guinee with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","One follow-up here. Your comment on Hudson Yard is very, very interesting. Talk about your current thoughts on Lower Manhattan because there isn't enough demand for both Hudson Yards and Lower Manhattan, I don't think, but tell me if we're wrong on that?","Steven Roth","David, you want to take a shot at that?","David R. Greenbaum","I guess the general comment I would make first is that as you look at the stock of New York, the 400 million square feet, we're effectively at the same size we were in this city some 20 years ago. Compared to any other market around the country, John. So yes, we're going to have some new builds downtown. It looks like Larry is, in fact, going to start one more building. I guess that was announced when he announced his deal with GroupM, which could add about another 2 million square feet downtown. But I think, overall, the factor you've got to take account of is yes, the buildings downtown do have tax subsidies. Steven Roth and the guys at Hudson Yards, basically what they're doing is seeking tenants, and they'll only build the building when they have substantial pre-leasing.","Steven Roth","I think the market will be able to absorb both, but David's point is, is that neither developer, whether it be Hudson Yards or the World Trade Center site, are going to build without tenants and financing. So I mean -- but look, the other thing is I think we've tried to emphasize this on this call. Our sweet spot is not the tenant that is susceptible to go to move into a 700,000-foot new build at either Hudson Yards or World Trade Center. We're in a different business, and we're intending to be a different business. And so we don't -- the buildings will come. Obviously, when a 600,000-foot tenant is sucked out of the Time -- the existing Time Warner Center or whatever, it has some effect on the marketplace. But I don't -- we don't think it's going to be a deep and troubling effect. And by the way, what I did say was, we are rooting for Hudson Yards because that's in our neighborhood, and that will have a -- as the 5 million or 6 million or 7 million square feet of office buildings that they're going to build over there over the next 5 or 10 years, fill up, the overflow and the activity that it creates in our neighborhood, 2 blocks away, will be enormous. I love Larry, but I'm rooting for Larry Silverstein a little less than I am rooting for Steve. That's going to get into the newspapers.","Operator","And our last question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Steve, you sort of answered my original question on the tax subsidies as far as competition for Penn Plaza but sort of bigger picture, if the tax incentives that the far west side in Downtown have received allow them to build new build for charging $70-type rents, does that mean that developers going forward are always going to demand for new construction, like with the Midtown zoning around Grand Central, that new developers anywhere get tax incentives? Has the city sort of opened that Pandora's box? Or You think that the city will be able to get back to tenants willing to pay the $100 for nonsubsidized development?","Steven Roth","The city has a history of being extremely difficult in terms of giving a one-off tax subsidy for this tenant or that tenant. And in fact, over the last 10 or 15 years, the city has seen tenants bluff and then tenants even move, and still not yielded. So these 2 developments, the World Trade Center and the Hudson Yards project, are both, I believe, unique, large, important political imperatives to get the city to have a stock of new and growing products. Similarly, what's happening around Grand Central is sort of similar. In fact, we were involved in sponsoring that. Within my letter 3 and 4 years ago. I wrote that this was the idea that Park Avenue was -- we thought -- we think, we, New Yorkers, think Park Avenue is the principal business thoroughfare in the world, but it's getting old and tired. So the long and the short of it is, is that I don't think that this portends that there will be new buildings going up all over the place with tax deals. In fact, I think the opposite. I think the city will continue its policy of focusing the tax incentives in the particular outlying areas, and both of those areas are outlying. I would find it difficult, I think, for us to go in and say we want to build a new building on Sixth Avenue and get a tax deal.","Operator","And that was our final question. I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth for closing remarks.","Steven Roth","Thank you, all, very much. We enjoyed your questions, and they're important. They make us think. We had a great quarter. We're proud of our financial results. We -- but some of the questions indicate the company still is too complex, and our strategy of simplifying and focusing the company continues to pace. So we're happy for your attendance. We'll look for you 3 months from now. We had a great quarter, and our simplification and focused program continues aggressively. Thanks very much.","Operator","And thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Michelle and I will be your operator for today's conference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell. Ma\u2019am you may begin.","Cathy Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust third quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our third quarter earnings release and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents as well as our supplemental financial information package are available on our website, www.vno.com, under the Investor Relations section.","In these documents and during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, Form 10-Q and financial supplement.","Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K, for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties.","The call may include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today's date. The Company does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statement. On the call today from management for our opening comments is Michael Franco, President. In addition, Steven Roth and our senior team are present and available for questions.","I will now turn the call over to Michael Franco.","Michael Franco","Thank you, Cathy, and good morning, everyone. Overall, our business is in great shape. Our buildings are full and we can see hone in on the significant opportunity that we have with the redevelopment of the Penn District.","Let me review our third quarter financial results before giving some thoughts on the markets and our portfolio and in particular the Penn District. Third quarter FFO as adjusted was $0.89 per share, $0.07 lower than last year's third quarter. As I discussed on last quarter\u2019s call these results were impacted primarily by reduced income related to the over $3.1 billion of asset sales we've completed year-to-date, and the lost income from the Topshop and Forever 21 bankruptcies.","Last quarter, I also discussed the impact of Topshop\u2019s closing at 608 Fifth Avenue and 478 Broadway. In August, we delivered the required nine-month notice to the ground resort at 608 Fifth Avenue. We will terminate the lease in May, 2020. This permanently reduces FFO by approximately $10 million annually and mix our NAV about roughly $1 per share. This ground lease had only 14 years left on it. It was not economic for us to hold on to.","Now to Forever 21, which we mentioned last quarter was restructuring candidate. As you know, they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the end of September. They are a tenant at 1540 Broadway and 435 Seventh Avenue.","They have a third lease with us at 4 Union Square, which expires next month and we chose not to renew them. We have already released a portion of that space to Whole Foods as part of their expansion and have a lease out with another important tenant for an additional portion both at higher rents than what Forever 21 was paying us here.","Forever 21\u2019s annual rent on 1540 Broadway and 435 Seventh Avenue totals approximately 20 million each year. While the bankruptcy process is fluid and it's still in its early stages, we have reached a tentative agreement with Forever 21 to shorten their laces and retain them in those two locations for a little less than half of their current rent.","With us having the right to recapture the spaces at any time after the first year, enabling us to secure long-term spaces. Both of these assets are in prime locations and we are confident of their long-term potential. So to summarize, even with these items, we remain on track to meet the approximate $3.40 per share and comparable FFO for 2019 that we referenced in the last quarters call.","Our non-comparable items this quarter included a couple of large gains, one the $178.8 million of net gains on sale of real estate, primarily related to the July sale or 25% interest in 330 Madison that we made eight times our investment; and two the $109 million after-tax net gain on unit closings at 220 Central Park South.","To-date we have closed on 48 units for net proceeds of $1.25 billion including 14 units, for $349 million this quarter. And we continue to sign new contracts for the few remaining units as well. Remember that we paid off the remainder of the $950 million loan on this asset in July.","So as closings continue through 2020 we retain all net proceeds, which importantly will be redeployed into Penn District redevelopments turning this capital into highly accretive earnings and propelling our future growth. Company-wide, our third quarter cash basis, same store NOI increased by 1%, broken down as follows. New York office and Street retail both up 1%, theMART was down 1% and 555 California Street was up 17.7%.","For the first nine months cash, same store NOI across the business was up 2.7%. Let me now turn to the New York market. The New York office market, which continues to be fueled by positive job growth in delivery of premium office product performed strongly during the third quarter of 2019.","Leasing activity across the city remains vibrant driven mainly by technology and financial tenants with the asking rents at record highs for the market overall. More than 25 million square feet of new leases have been signed in New York during the first three quarters of 2019 with many large deals in process expected to close in the fourth quarter.","Talent wants to be in New York and therefore companies are migrating to and expanding in the city, creating tremendous competition for top talent. No where is this more evident than with the dramatic demand from the big tech companies. Executives view their real estate as one of the key drivers to recruiting the best and brightest talent to their teams.","Private sector jobs decreased 53,000 in the first nine months on pace with 2018 with nine months office sector jobs increasing about 18,000 as compared to 20,000 for all of 2018 and certainly had a pace strong enough to continue absorbing new supply coming online. There are currently 65 tenants actively looking for a 100,000 square feet or more totalling 16 million square feet potential activity.","This demand is coming from all indices, all industry sectors from companies already in the city as well as those seeking their first home here. Our development in the Penn District is seeing the benefits of this demand as we are in the full gear on our 5.2 million square feet of combined redevelopments as Farley and PENN1 and PENN2.","We are experiencing robust interest in all three projects as perspective tenants begin to appreciate the magnitude of our district transformation. Tenants are responding very favorably to the unique nature of our amenities, space of offerings and design elements at each property that will serve today's workforce at the most successful location directly on top of the most important transportation hub integration","Farley is one of a kind and we have great activity on the space. At PENN2, we are negotiating a lease with a 400,000 square foot headquarters tenant and there's more in the works beyond this.","All at rents at or above our underwriting, all our activities will benefit from significant public sector projects being built in our district, including the new grand Moynihan Train Hall, which will be delivered in 2020, the expanded LIR concourse running from Seventh and Eighth Avenues by the end of 2021 and a soaring new station entrance at 33rd Street at PLAZA33.","Against the backdrop of this district transformation, we are place-making the entire district in our heart at work negotiating deals to curate the district with new food and beverage outlets by leading operators, coffee spots, fitness offerings and other retail-as-a-service our tenants.","These additions will dramatically enhance our offering and drive greater demand and rental rates within our 10 million square foot district portfolio. Our goal simply is to make the Penn District and our holding specifically the go-to location for tenants in the city. More broadly, our New York office portfolio is in great shape and can see us to perform well.","We are substantially full with occupancy ending the quarter at 96.8%. Our remaining 2019 expirations are only 85,000 square feet while our 2020 expirations are modest total of 1,055,000 square feet with 760,000 square feet of this amount expiring at PENN1 and PENN2.","Please remember this includes 565,000 square feet at PENN2, which will be taken out of service in 2020 as this development kicks into high gear. This will bring the total added service at PENN2 at the end of next year to approximately 1 million square feet. Basically, we're repositioning the buildings from mid-60s per square foot rents to the 90s and need to move the old tenants out in order to accommodate the new ones.","During the third quarter, our leasing team completed 25 leases totaling 197,000 square feet in New York and over $80 per square foot starting rents with very strong second generation positive mark-to-markets of 22.7% cash and 28.5% GAAP.","We have now completed 814,000 square feet of leases during the first three quarters of 2019 at a healthy average starting rent of $79 per square foot. In the quarter, we signed our first lease at our new build at 512 West 22nd Street on the High Line with WarnerMedia for 20,000 square feet at a triple-digit rent. We also have an additional lease out here for 43,000 square feet at triple-digits, which we expect to sign in the fourth quarter.","Additionally, during the quarter we finalized a relocation expansion deal with an existing tenant in our portfolio, which we'll be moving from Midtown to 28,000 square feet at 330 West 34th Street in the Penn District. The starting rent per square foot here is in the high 80s, a record for this building, which is clearly benefiting as tenants recognize what's coming with the Penn District transformation. Overall, tenant dialogue across our entire portfolio is very strong. We're as busy as ever with 3 million square foot up deals in different stages and negotiations, including a strong momentum at Farley and PENN2.","Moving to Chicago now. At theMART during the quarter, we executed 45,000 square feet of leases at an average starting rent of over $48 per square foot with positive mark-to-markets of 6.7% cash and 14.9% GAAP. This included an expansion lease with all state for 17,500 square feet, raising the total footprint to 120,000 square feet, occupancy here is 95%.","In San Francisco, the market continues to be hitting on all cylinders. With our campus here at 100% occupancy, we are taking advantage of the extreme tightness in the market and are now discussing with renewals with several important tenants totaling 180,000 square feet well advanced their expirations.","During the quarter, we leased 50,000 square feet, including a 42,000 square foot renewal expansion with an existing tenant in 315 Montgomery Street, at a starting rent of $97 per square foot. Please note our positive mark-to-markets on second generation space here, which were spectacular 39.3% cash and 64.5% GAAP.","Before turning to our retail business. Let me comment on rework. There's been some speculation in the press that we and several other landlords that meaningful exposure rework, quite the opposite is true in our case. We work as a tenant in only one location, 606 Broadway, mere 15,000 square feet of share. While we appreciate some of the creativity the rework brought to the office business.","We chose to lease our space to end users with better credit over the past few years. Notwithstanding this, we do think that co-working provides an important service in the real estate ecosystem and we will be providing flex space as part of our overall offering for tenants at PENN1 and PENN2. This space will provide our tenants swing space, co-working space, meeting and social spaces, food and more. We will brand this space under the Vornado name and importantly retain the bulk of the upside.","Turning now to our New York Street retail business. Overall, the retail market continues to be challenging with leasing velocity is slow and assets prone to negative surprises, \u00e0 la Topshop and Forever 21. Retail occupancy was 95.9% at quarter-end. In the third quarter in spite of the challenging leasing environment, we executed nine leases for 26,000 square feet of retail space achieving positive mark-to-markets of 6.2% cash and 15.6% GAAP of second generation space.","During the first week of October, we finalized the replacement lease for the short lived former Four Seasons Restaurant at 280 Park Avenue with the famous best-in-class Fasano hotel and restaurant group. Fasano has been a symbol of quality fine-dining and excellence in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio since 1949. This will be their first New York restaurant and we'll focus on classic Italian cuisine similar to those they operate in Brazil. Fasano will deliver the best and fine dining to Midtown Manhattan while creating atmosphere style, sophistication and the energy. We think this will further enhance the quality of our tenant experience at 280 Park and are excited for their openings in the first half of 2020.","We continue to maintain a fortress balance sheet with reasonable leverage and an abundance of liquidity today and growing over the next few years. Our current liquidity is $3.36 billion, comprised of $1.28 billion in cash, restricted cash and securities and $2.08 billion undrawn on our revolving credit facilities.","Lastly, I want to remind you that based on tactical games from our assets sales year-to-date, we are currently anticipating paying out a special dividend of approximately $1.90 per share this year.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you so much, sir. We will now begin the question-and answer-session. [Operator Instructions] The first question in the queue comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open, please proceed.","Manny Korchman","Hey, good morning everyone. If you think about the leasing pipeline you talked about in the Penn District and you dissect that, how many of those tenants are looking to make a move or stay within sort of the Hudson Yards and Manhattan West, Penn District\u2019s corridor versus looking elsewhere in the city?","Glen Weiss","Hi Manny, it's Glen Weiss. We're seeing a real balance of activity both from tenants in Midtown, Park Avenue tenants, Sixth Avenue tenants, looking at all of our projects. In addition, we have a lot of activity from the tech sector, the ever-growing, brimming tech guys are all looking at the projects as well. So I'll tell you the balance of tenants from within Midtown core and from tenants looking to continue expand in the city.","Manny Korchman","Thanks Glen. And then on the Forever 21, comments that you made how did you think about sort of giving them that rent relief and the impact that would have on both leasing and other tenants\u2019 psychology?","Michael Franco","Manny, obviously, it\u2019s a negative surprise, right in the sense of we had term on the lease and all of a sudden, they filed and so you have to deal with a real-time situation. And I think the deal that we struck has been finalized now, works for both parties but I think importantly, keeps the space occupied, paying rent and allows us the flexibility to go troll for tenants and find tenants, they'll occupy that space long-term.","So if you think about the locations individually, 1540 Broadway is arguably the best location in the city right now, right. From a street retail perspective, Times Square is the strongest marketplace, tenants sales are holding up the best. And we have the block from one side of the boat tie that is a premium location.","So with appropriate time, we will find a replacement tenant, a great tenant there and are confident about what we're going to achieve. On 435 Seventh Avenue, right that was always a short-term deal. There's a five-year deal, the tenant to get us through the period when we're ready to redevelop the entire block. And so this continues to preserve that for a period of time. We can go replace them if we want. If not, we'll keep it in place but again, there's a bigger picture on 435.","Manny Korchman","Thanks everyone.","Operator","And the next question in the queue comes from Nick Yulico with Scotia Bank. Your line is open.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. I just wanted to ask about, you talked about Topshop, Forever 21, I just wanted to be clear. Are these impacts that are only starting to hit NOI in the fourth quarter is trying to kind of bridge what you're reporting in the third quarter versus these impacts.","Joe Macnow","Hi Nick. It's Joe. Next the Topshop started to affect us in Q3 and Q2 we think, Forever 21 starts to affect in Q3.","Nick Yulico","Okay. So I guess, I'm sorry if I missed this, if you went through it, but I'm just trying to understand how \u2013 always thinking about that 340 kind of soft number for the year on FFO, what are some of the items in the fourth quarter that create that drag versus what you reported in the third quarter?","Joe Macnow","So Nick, when we had the second quarter call, we said that the sale of items and the other items we discussed that reduced NOI going forward. If you apply them to the six month numbers, you get 340. The third quarter last year was $0.96, this year its $0.89, that's a diminution of $0.07. That really comes primarily from sales. Specifically the retail JV is $8.2 million of that reduction, 330 Madison, $1.4 million, the sale of Lexington shares 3.3 million, the sale of Urban Edge $1.9 million, the delta between the dividend on pre and our share of their earnings another million.","And then there were other items that makes $0.07 or the delta in $9 million \u2013 $15 million, all of those items continue in Q4. And with that and now with even the Forever 21 effect in Q4, which we didn't know when we talked about the 340, other pluses and minuses leave us comfortable at 340.","Nick Yulico","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. Just one last question on for OEM and you have a lot of interest in the building from what we've heard, there\u2019s some press reports on it. Can you give us a sense \u2013 on getting the building leased and then in terms of the yield that you're giving there in the supplemental, I don't think that's been updated in a while. We've heard you've kind of been pushing rents in the building. So is there upside to that yield in the building?","Michael Franco","Look, I think there has been a lot of press speculation about Farley and there's quite a bit of interest in the asset. And I think as we've talked about on prior calls it's a totally unique asset. We wish we had five of them. And so the interest has been high. We're not prepared to comment on when have you might get done in terms of that deal. But even if we sign a lease near-term, the cash flow is not going to start probably till beginning of 2022. So the interest is high. I think the yields that we published in the last quarter was our best assessment as to where it would end up, we're not prepared to make any adjustments to that.","Obviously, we have some sense based on some dialogue at that time. And I think the interest in the retail has been significant as well. So we have to let it play out, but I think we put the third and second quarter numbers was continues to be our best guess as to where the yields will end up.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. I guess, Mike, when you look \u2013 Michael, when you look through kind of the retail tenant list, some of these things are kind of popping up that maybe you weren't expecting. Just what \u2013 like how do you sort of look at the watch-list today? What other potential tenants, maybe without naming specifics, are you sort of worried about moving into 2020 at this point?","Michael Franco","Look Steve, the retail market is soft. Tenants performances are not what they were a few years ago. And so generally, we watch everybody, six, nine months ago Forever 21 was struggling, but we didn't necessarily expect them to file bankruptcy. So I don't think there's necessarily anybody that we look at the way the view as in the same position today. But we're constantly watching what may happen with different retailers. And so, there's risk in the sector. We do have \u2013 I think on average about eight years weighted average term on leases in retail and we continue to view that durability is a real strength. And so no specific names that I would mention, but everybody is mainly focused on.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then maybe just a question for Glen, I mean, I realize you guys don't have a lot of space coming due that Michael outlined, but just sort of what is the tenant psychology today as tenants are thinking about their 2020, 2021, maybe 2022 expirations and are you seeing more tenants coming to you sooner in order to lock in deals? I mean just sort of what does that dynamic today?","Glen Weiss","I think the tenor of the market is very good, Steve. We're seeing a lot of tenants, number one, expanding in the portfolio, lot of tenants looking for new space in the portfolio. We do see tenants who have expiring leases forward or looking at our developments in Penn specifically. So I'd tell you, I think the market overall is healthy, the tenant demand is strong and the tenants are still very active across all the sub-markets.","Michael Franco","I would just add Steve, look I think if we look at the \u2013 because we look at the pipeline \u2013 we were chatting here a few days ago, I think the activity really across all sub-markets, whether it's Midtown, Midtown South, Penn District, we have good action across the board and I think that's reflective of the fact that the tenants are growing and the market is healthy.","Steve Sakwa","And then just lastly, could you just comment on the TI leasing commissions? I think it looked a bit elevated on a couple of areas. I think in New York it looked a bit high. I was just wondering if that was a specific deal or kind of what you're seeing on the concession front?","Glen Weiss","It\u2019s Glen. During the quarter, particularly this quarter, we had a bulk of our leasing via our turnkey program. So we built space for tenants. Those leases had relatively short-term at around seven years on average on out leasing. And the way we look at the turnkeys, we build them today, we lease them for the term and there's definitely a great value in the next-generation of the leasing of those spaces. So that's why you see that elevated TI number this quarter.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thanks and good morning. So I know you guys kind of confirmed the 340 for FFO, but I think on the last call, you talked about a low 200 range for street retail. Are you still comfortable with that outlook or has that changed?","Joe Macnow","Good morning, Jamie. That is the number that Steve referenced in the last call. Like I think that number may still be fine but there are some things in flux. Obviously, Forever 21, we have a handshake deal and until that's done and we see how that plays out, [indiscernible] generally as a company in that specific arrangement that can have an impact. We sold a couple of assets including 340 M for example that comes out of that number.","And then the last thing I would say is that we are now projecting to take the retail on railroad concourse out of service and next year for a couple of years while we redevelop the concourse. So when that comes back, we're going to have additional retail square footage which we think is going to be in very high demand based on that retail today. And the income will be higher, but we're going to lose $12 million per year temporarily. So yes, there's a couple of things that are moving around. Again some of those temporarily, we need to see how Forever 21 plays out. But I think the general numbers that Steve outlined in the last call still appears fine.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Thank you. And then I thought I heard you say you're in talks for a 400,000 square foot headquarter deal at 2 PENN. Can you talk more about that potential lease and then just timing, like a 400,000 square foot block, how that would fit into the building and how we think about the ins and outs over the next couple of years if that hits?","Glen Weiss","The lease is out. We expect the lease to get signed in the next few months. The tenant would start their construction once we delivered the redeveloped building to them. So, deal \u2013 it\u2019s a deal we like a lot. And we're going to try to close it in the next few months.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then finally for me, just I know you had said you're seeing expansions pretty healthy market conditions. Can you just talk about your view of kind of traditional Midtown versus Midtown West? It sounds like a lot of the activity is Midtown West, but if the tenants you're talking to do end up moving to the West side, what did you think the outlook is for more traditional Midtown and market conditions there?","Glen Weiss","I can speak in terms of our portfolio, Jamie, in Midtown. And we are still seeing expansions in the buildings in Midtown, whether it's a 1290, a 90 Park, 280 Park, an 887. So we are seeing expansions throughout our Midtown portfolio, we \u2013 in our portfolio, we have not lost a tenant to the new developments on the West side. So I can't really specifically speak about others losing their tenants, migrating their, but we are seeing expansions still healthy within our portfolio in the Midtown district.","Michael Franco","And the other thing I'd add, Jamie, is that I think we've talked about this now on a few calls is that, in order to compete effectively in this marketplace, your buildings have to be monitored from an infrastructure standpoint and technology standpoint, amenities standpoint. And we got ahead of that starting many years ago, all of our buildings in Midtown has been renovated. We attracted top-flight tenants to anchor those redevelopments.","And so when you look at our assets, notwithstanding the activity levels, which are healthy on them, they're generally put to bed for awhile. There's not \u2013 so you look at the leasing activity in last quarter, this quarter, next quarter we alluded to, there's not a lot of role because we did the work, put those buildings to bed, had healthy rents and strong tenants. So I think where you're going to see some impacts from those landlords that have either inferior locations or functionally obsolescent assets, we\u2019re starting to move out, going to occur beginning in two, three, four years.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from John Kim with BMO. Your line is open. Please proceed.","John Kim","Thank you. A question on the Forever 21 rent type. Is your expectation that you will release that space in a meaningfully higher rent or is there a new rent really reflective for the market?","Michael Franco","John, I had a little trouble hearing you at the end there. Just repeat the question please.","John Kim","Sure. Do you foresee releasing this space of Forever 21 at a higher rent or is there new rent really reflective of where market rates are today?","Michael Franco","I would say, take them individually right on 1540 Broadway, our expectation is as I said, given the quality of that space that we should be able to achieve a higher rent and what the deal is with them. And 435 Seventh was a temporary deal, we went to lease that in long-term that rent would absolutely be higher. But again, we want to keep flexibility there and so we\u2019re balancing flexibility with how much rent we're going to get. So frankly, I know you guys care quarter-to-quarter what the rent is there. We don't really care what the rent is for the next four and a half years as we can see and put our plans together for that block.","John Kim","Okay. And Michael, you mentioned 65 tenants potentially looking for up to 16 million square feet in Manhattan. Do you have any commentary on how much of that is new demand versus musical chairs?","Glen Weiss","It's Glenn. It's a mix. It's a mix of type of tenant, whether demands expansion, relocation it's a mixed bag across all the industry sectors, across all the sub-markets. I wouldn't necessarily pinpoint one particular flavor of activity within that subset.","John Kim","But what about\u2026","Michael Franco","John, the one thing I would add is, you see that really I think in space this year right is the growth from the tech companies, which \u2013 I don't think, most people didn't see the magnitude that was going to occur this year and there continues to be dialogue on, those are major impacts that tend to happen. I think with much greater speeds and a lot of the other leasing from traditional tenants. So we continue to see migration once those tenants get here, their expansion has been pretty significant.","John Kim","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question in the queue comes from John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open. Please proceed.","John Guinee","Great. Two sources and uses questions. First can you remind us again when you have access as a preferred equity from the retail deal you did earlier this year? And then what do you expect to be the remaining after-tax proceeds of 220 Central Park South? And then the next sources and uses is how do you think the JP Morgan news ultimately plays out, does this result in a stable headcount in New York city or is it down 20%?","Glen Weiss","So John, good morning. I\u2019ll let Joe answer the after-tax proceeds on two points.","Joe Macnow","Okay. We'll start with that. John. Hi, how are you? It\u2019s Joe.","John Guinee","Good.","Joe Macnow","John, we have \u2013 excuse me.","John Guinee","Where's Steve?","Joe Macnow","Sitting next to me.","John Guinee","Good, good.","Joe Macnow","We have 1.9 billion in future sales, the lion\u2019s share of which is under the contract, there's another 100,000 of taxes against that 1.9 billion and another 100,000 of cost to complete the project against that 1.9 billion. So net of all costs, net of all taxes from this point forward, we'll be receiving $1.7 billion plus or minus from remaining sales closings of the sales at 220.","Michael Franco","So John, just on your\u2026","John Guinee","You\u2019ll be all over the newspapers tomorrow.","Michael Franco","Your other question, John, so on the retail preferred, we have not said specifically in the past when that can be refinanced. And I think we continue to not want to the state that there's some tax sensitivities to that, but we will in due time be able to refinance and redeem that retail preferred. But thank you for pointing that out. That is a another significant source of capital we will have access to in a few years.","In terms of the JP Morgan announcement like I think the most important thing to remember is that they are building a significant world-class headquarters on Park Avenue right now and have recommitted to New York city through doing that. So this is their home, I don't think it's unusual for companies to get the banks to move back office personnel outside of New York, whether that's went to New Jersey or went to other cities. And so I think this is along those lines, but I haven't heard any announcements on percentage of headcounts, whatnot. You all have to sort of read that news. But there's ebbs and flows in the city in terms of companies and how they grow and manage their headcount. I think JPMorgan is just doing it.","John Guinee","Great. We missed you, Steve. Thank you.","Operator","The next person in the cue comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open, sir.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey good morning, good morning. So, two questions. First you guys obviously talked a lot about the big-tech demand this year that surprised the market. And at the same time, [indiscernible] is busy contemplating redeveloping One Madison, you guys have the Farley, but at the same time you have the Forever hotel, Pennsylvania. So are there, is there sufficient demand in the market where you guys would start to, I don't know if it dust off the old plans may be reconceived but where that project starts to be something that may actually come to fruition given the tech demand, the city and its locations."," ","Good morning house. Look we are unbelievably excited about the hotel Penn site. We think that that site, we are done transforming Seventh Avenue with a PENN1 and PENN2. We think its going to be the best development sites in the city. So, but time is not here yet. We're going to finish developing PENN1 and PENN2 and we think that follows that after the fact. So, you are guesstimating what demand is going to look like and two, three, four years and knowing and you can effectively do that. But we biggest goal and the plan we have for that is going to be unique. We think that will appeal to all sorts of tenants.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is, just going back to the questions on retail rents, Topshop, you mentioned a cut to rent. The Ikea replacement for this year is out in Rego Park is a cut from what Sears was paying. So it would almost sound like rent for street retail are, they're either coming down dramatically or these were special circumstances where they were so far above where the market had moved. Or maybe it's just the amount of space to, so maybe you can just give a little bit more color on the dramatic cuts that we're seeing in these locations versus where you think, sort of generic \u2013 your generic, your average street retail lease would reprise.","Michael Franco","So like, I think we've talked about, frankly for the last at least two years that, the street retail rents like Steve was, was really, I think he was early in saying it and that the market has been correcting, right? The retail demand was down and therefore rents followed. And therefore rents followed. I think it's probably been most significant in Madison Avenue and, so and again, no deals that were signed that, high water marks, seeing those rents come down.","So Madison, could be down, certainly well North of a thousand and certainly below that, below a thousand today. So yes, the market has been correcting and we\u2019ve bottomed. The answer is in some sub markets that we're close in and maybe a couple others, not necessarily yet.","But I think it's case by case, right? Depends on when the lease was signed. We have many leases that are still below market. We have obviously some that are above market, depends on what the advantage of those leases were. And obviously windows leads this role. Can't predict where the market will be at that time, but in some cases, the asset and maybe a better year. So Topshop, SOHO, that was entirely retail. And, today the best answer may be that, the ground floor space is retail and the upper floor has become office and income is, not that different.","That office space with the Crosby street address we think is going to be very attractive and we have interest already. So I think it depends on the asset. It depends on the sub-market but clearly, rents have been corrected.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question in the queue comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks for taking, I have two questions. So just one following up on Street retail, any update on the Massimo space or the Madison assets.","Michael Franco","Good morning Vikram, nothing really to report, on either one of those. We have some kind of dialogue going on Fifth Avenue but nothing is imminent. Retailers continue to be cautious and are conservative on making large commitments, which, Fifth Avenue generally is. So nothing to report there.","I think Madison is a little bit different where, Madison is slow, there's no sugarcoating. The demand on Madison is probably the lowest of any sub-market in the city. And so, it's going to continue to take some time to fill out.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, great. And then just, I just want to clarify on the 340 and the run rate going into next year. Joe, should we assume that therefore the FFO in 4Q is closer to $0.80 to hit that 340 and you still anticipate recouping a lot of those losses heading into 2020?","Joe Macnow","Hi, Vikram, so far we\u2019ve talked about Forever 21. We've said that the rent at share is 20 million and that's going to be diminished by at least half. We talked about the Long Island Rail Road Concourse coming out of service next year. Either one of those things were included when we talked about the 2020 versus 2019. Now as you know, we don't give guidance, but that being said, as a result of that negative effect of Forever 21 additional out of service at PENN1 and PENN2 to the support our development plans, including the [indiscernible] lower expectations from hotel Pennsylvania. We no longer believe that 2020, will be a substantial bounce back here. It's going to have to wait a little longer.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. That sounds good. I'll follow offline. Thank you.","Steven Roth","Yes. Vikram, I would just add to what Joe said though, which is, notwithstanding may not be a bounce back year, and I know, you and others are very focused on the next few quarters and I think as we look at our business, our big growth engine is Penn District and we have tremendous confidence in what we're doing there. The early reception has been very positive. And so, that's going to take some time to kick in, but it's going to be meaningful when it does. And obviously we publish the information on the first few redevelopments last quarter. And so we feel good about that. So it's going require a little patience, but the growth is going to come quite meaningfully.","Vikram Malhotra","That's great. And I just wanted to just clarify, just on the 340 Joe, the run is at 340 still in tax for the reported full year or that was that a run rate sort of number?","Joe Macnow","No, that's, the number we expect to publish at the end of this year or calendar 2019.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, great. I'll, follow up post the call. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question in the queue comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it's Michael Bilerman with Manny. Just a few follow-up questions. Michael, you mentioned that 400,000 square foot headquarters lease and I don't know if Glen or David or yourself want to answer this, but I guess at when do you sort of disclose that information to the street? Cause I go to assume in your comment that there was a lot more in the works. And I assume that set Farley and maybe other stuff at PENN1 or PENN2 and other buildings. So, I guess at what point in the negotiation do you feel comfortable making a statement like you did about a significant value creating lease? Like the one you mentioned?","Michael Franco","Look Mike, I think we'll announce it when the lease is actually signed. I guess the general view, we have good dialogue going on the assets right now, but the actual, actual detailed come home and finalize the lease.","Michael Bilerman","But I guess in this case this lease is out for signature. I guess you talked about it on the call. It's out for signature. I just didn't know at what point in the process, let's say at least at Farley would be at what point you would be talking about that in the open about real.","Michael Franco","Yes. Just when it's signed Michael.","Michael Bilerman","Like, so in this case, the 400,000 was signed and you're just going through the door.","Michael Franco","400,000 there is, we're negotiating the lease.","Michael Bilerman","So I guess in the other leases that you're negotiating, how sizable are those and where do they stand in the process relative to this 400,000","Joe Macnow","Hi, Michael, I think you're trying to pin down on exactly where we are. This, I think there is really nothing more to say. Right? I think high level what we\u2019ve said is, it all that we're prepared to say right now? When the leases get signed, we'll announce those. You'll know about those. But until they're done, nothing's done. And maybe beyond what we mentioned specifically is again, still, just active dialogue and negotiation. And not ready for it to be reported.","Michael Bilerman","Right. I\u2019ll look it, it's very exciting to hear about the PENN2 lease. I was just trying to understand the surface policies that you have in terms of disclosing it, and that was really more than I was trying to get out.","Joe Macnow","We\u2019re excited too Michael but got to wait a little bit.","Michael Bilerman","And maybe a question for Steve. You've not been shy about where your shares trade relative to the inherent value of the asset base and you've been extraordinarily aggressive over the last six years at simplifying a lot of the complexity spins, merge, sales, completely new construction at 220, done the Farley buy out all variety of long lists. I guess where is your head today in terms of further sort of potential sales? In most obvious would be something on the office side, either New York or outside of New York either an end joint venture or outright or is all the focus right now on Penn Plaza and the redevelopment efforts?","Steven Roth","All of the above. I'll say a couple of things. Number one everything's on the table as it has been for the last number of years. Number two, we are certainly not done yet. Number three is we definitely are not satisfied with our stock price at all. And just, I would like to throw it back to you. For example you said asset sales outside of New York and I guess you were referring to San Francisco or Chicago. I would remind you that for the last five years, you and your brethren had been begging me to sell San Francisco. And in the last five years it has gone up in vacuum over a $1 billion since we continue to hold it. So everything's on the table. We're not done yet.","And we\u2019re actually surprised by our stock price. But Mr. Market speaks and we're not done yet.","Michael Bilerman","Joe, just in terms of 220 the 1.7 billion is that also include the basis, the money that you have in the buildings. So it's effectively, we should think about a billion seven of cash.","Steven Roth","Michael, Joe spoke a little bit out of turn, trying to be very, very thorough. The answer is, is that we have published numbers which show that the sell out of that building is about $3.3 billion. And the cost of that building is about $2 billion. Okay. So you can do the math from there. The important thing is, is that all of we, we paid off the indebtedness. So all of the closings that come from in the future go into our treasury and go to Penn Plaza. So we, but now it's that we've started, we have closed a 1.2 or 3 billion. You could deduct that from the sellout. You can do the math.","Joe Macnow","My math was consistent with what Steve said.","Steven Roth","Okay. You can't go back with that. One of the reasons, we've been, I've been accused of being secretive with respect to that property. That's really not the case. We have a very important clientele and I think the word discreet is more important than your, the residential real estate market is a very gossipy market. So, information that gets into that market is not helpful.","Operator","Okay. So the next question to queue comes from Daniel Ismail with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Daniel Ismail","Good morning guys. Just a quick question on New York city office cap rates. Given the movement in the 10 year as most sales that we've seen in New York, where we stand today earlier that you guys put up 4.5 cap on your office holdings, do you think we've drifted higher or lower at that time?","Steven Roth","I don't know that I would change it, Daniel, but obviously we do it once a year. You know, we'll revisit the time and see, where the markets are and what we're hearing from capital sources. I do think that the fact that interest rates have trended back down and appear to be stabilizing at lower levels, I think it is brain capital further into real estate as a general matter. And I think that a number of the capital sources we talked to, I think we view New York as there's value here, right?","So, cap rates probably widened a bit over the last year or so. And given where the tenure is, you can finance, on a reasonable leverage basis, generally below 4% right now. So that's a very attractive catch on cash yield. And so as the hedging costs have come in for a number of the capital sources abroad that are, that's an important issue. I think you, I think you're seeing capital sources refocus a bit and not just in the U.S .but, on New York as potentially a value play given values. And frankly, pretty flat, maybe even a little bit down over the last few years.","So, there's a lot that goes into what we publish, not just, where the market is, but how much growth is in a particular asset or vacancy or whatnot. So we'll, revisit that, as we get closer to when we publish it. But I think today directionally is not far off.","Glen Weiss","Daniel, you guys have been hustling that New York is overpriced. I'm not sure we agree with that. So if you look at comps, the comps pretty much support the cap rates that we have been using. The volume of activity in the capital markets has definitely been declining. It's been declining all over the country and all over the world. So it's a very specific asset by asset calculation. Now the NAV calculation is not intended to be, nor can it possibly be a rigorously ruthless \u2013 ruthlessly accurate correct number to the $0.01, it's a range. And so the volume is down. Pricing is pretty much holding on specific assets. And we think that you are a little bit too pessimistic on your thinking about New York, and even more than \u2013 maybe even significantly too pessimistic.","Daniel Ismail","All right, that's fair. Maybe just a quick follow-up PENN1 and PENN2 based on some earlier comments. You mentioned wanting to do the flex space there yourself. Is that a results of any of the turmoil we've seen at we work and wanting to reduce operator risk? Or is that a conscious decision of wanting to capture some of the upside in flexible leasing and keep sort of that tenant experience in-house?","Glen Weiss","Hi, it's Glen. We think in Penn, it's important to create a flex space for our portfolio, for our tenants, particularly at PENN1, the big building 2.5 million feet, more than 200 tenants are in the building, we're always seeing tenants needing agile space, whether it's swing space, expansion space, short-term band-aid space for whatever reason. So we think in Penn, doing the co-working, the flex space is going to be huge benefit for us in our tenants.","And of course with that, we do expect it to be a profitable operation, which is why we decided to do what at PENN1.","Steven Roth","When you think about like this is part of the center piece of the Penn District. We want to control exactly what goes on here exactly how we want to create the right back. And so we don't think anybody is better to do that than ourselves. I think we've proven that over the years and what we've done. And so \u2013 and when you think about when you lease to a co-working operator, you're generally providing the bulk of the TIs and getting a lease and maybe get a little upside. You're not getting a lot of credit and you have a capped upside. So here we're going to invest the capital exactly what we wanted. And create the right environment and capture the bulk of the upside. And so for us it's a pretty straightforward answer.","Daniel Ismail","Makes sense. Thanks, guys.","Steven Roth","And then by the way, that's always been the plan.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question in the queue comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on that last question. I mean have you \u2013 what \u2013 I know it hasn't been that long, but what changes have you seen in the market since we were pulled our IPO in terms of demand for co-working or just tenant behavior or discussions.","Steven Roth","I haven't seen any change Jamie. No change.","Glen Weiss","Obviously, we watched no signs of this Jamie.","Jamie Feldman ","Well, I guess just the attitude towards co-working and flexibly thing. I mean it certainly seems like the products, that cycle seems a lot more talked about in tendency more interested.","Steven Roth","Look, I think it's \u2013 I think the way that people work hadn\u2019t used that space. I think got to here to stay. And just one of the reasons we're offering that type of space in the Penn District. I do think my own view would be that, there's been this big discussion of shift toward enterprise after these co-working companies, particularly we work. And I think those large enterprises are going to focus even harder on who their landlord is.","So I think that accrues to the traditional landlords. And quite a bit like us, and so the desk by desk and small companies, I think co-working will continue to be an alternative for a number of those. But I do think that the shifts are 10 or back a little bit.","Operator","Thank you, sir. We have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over to Mr. Michael Franco for any closing remarks.","Michael Franco","Thank you, everybody for joining the call.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Catherine Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust second quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our second quarter earnings release and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents, as well as our supplemental financial information package, are available on our website, www.VNO.com, under the Investor Relations section.","In these documents and during today's call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Division; and Stephen Theriot, Chief Financial Officer.","Also in the room are Michael Franco, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer; and Joseph Macnow, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thanks, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's second quarter call.","Business is actually terrific. As David will tell you in a minute, in New York we are enjoying robust demand from all manner of tenants, led by financial services and creatives in all of our submarkets and at record rents. Ditto for our largest and best-in-class Manhattan street retail business.","Here are some headline numbers from the quarter. Eight office deals in four separate buildings, totaling 223,000 square feet at rents over $100, actually $110; $82 average starting rent on new leases at 20% mark-to-market; 300% and 400% mark-to-market on several large street retail leases with more to come; a handful of Penn Plaza deals at over $70 a foot; and 220 Central Park South is breaking all records.","In New York, we are basically full. In Washington, as Mitchell will tell you in a minute, green chutes are beginning to sprout. Washington has clearly bottomed. It's beginning to come back. It's just a matter of time.","I'd like to begin this morning by mentioning that in Penn Plaza, we are the dominant owner with 9 million square feet. We have taken an important first step in the redevelopment of this district, with a test closure of 33rd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.","The idea here is to create a large public pedestrian plaza, where the street had been, which will provide amenities to the public, improve circulation and access to Penn Station, and connect our One Penn and Two Penn properties, which comprise 4.2 million square feet. This is an important first step in neighborhood change and creating a sense of place, being made possible by the support of government and the community.","Now to acquisitions. We are increasing our exposure to the thriving West Chelsea submarket. This quarter we entered into a joint venture, in which we have a 55% interest, which will develop 173,000 square foot Class A office building on the high line at 22nd Street. We are also developing a 130,000 square foot new build at A Venture, in the same part of town as 61 Ninth Avenue at 15th Street.","Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of 260 Eleventh Avenue, a 235,000 square foot office property, currently leased to the City of New York through 2021, plus a 10,000 square foot contiguous adjacent parking lot and adjacent development rights. This Eleventh Avenue property runs the entire block front from 26th Street to 27th Street, and is directly across from the Starrett-Lehigh building.","Total consideration here was $190 million in the form of a ground lease with a fixed purchase option and $80 million of our partnership units. This off-market acquisition was facilitated by our long-term relationship with the same sellers from whom we acquired 770 Broadway. As you know, the 1.1 million square foot 770 Broadway is now the premier building in its submarket, and serves as headquarters for Facebook, J.Crew and AOL.","The plan for 260 Eleventh is much the same, it will undergo a redevelopment and expansion to attract creative class and TAMI tenants. So with 260 Eleventh Avenue and including 85 Tenth Avenue, 61 Ninth Avenue and 510 West 22nd Street, we will be one of the largest owners in the important West Chelsea market.","Continuing with acquisitions. In June, we completed the acquisition of 150 West 34th Street, a 78,000 square foot retail property leased to Old Navy through May 2019, which came with 226,000 square feet of additional zoning air rights. The property is located directly across the street from Macy's, and adds an important piece to our dominance in the Penn Plaza district. The purchase price was $355 million. At closing, we completed a $205 million financing on the property.","With regard to dispositions. We are under contract to sell our 50% interest in the Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, New Jersey, to our joint venture partner at a value of $229 million. Proceeds to us will be $37 million. The financial statement gain of $30 million will be recognized in the third quarter.","With this disposition, we have essentially completed our exit of the mall and strip shopping center business, representing roughly $7 billion of assets. Let me recap, what we have accomplished here. In January, we completed the tax-free spin-off of Urban Edge properties to our shareholders.","This $4 million Northeast-centric shopping center REIT is led by CEO, Jeff Olson and COO, Bob Minutoli. We recruited Jeff, as seasoned best-in-class shopping center CEO, and Bob is a long-time alum of ours. Also this year, we completed the transfer of Springfield Mall to PREIT for $486 million.","In the prior couple of years, to complete our exit, we sold Kings Plaza for $751 million, our share being $243 million; Green Acres for $500 million; Beverly Connection for $260 million; Broadway Mall for $94 million; and 36 other smaller retail assets for an aggregate of $360 million. Excluding Urban Edge, which was spun-off, aggregate net gains were over $450 million.","Now to operations. We had a very strong second quarter, and I'm very pleased with our financial results. Our second quarter comparable FFO was $1.30 per share, 5.7% higher than last year's second quarter.","As Steve Theriot will tell you shortly, excluding income in last year's second quarter from asset sales of our real estate fund, asset sales really shouldn't be included in FFO at all. But excluding those fund asset sales, comparable FFO per share would have increased a whopping 20%.","Company-wide, in the quarter we leased 1,169,000 square feet in 126 transactions. In Manhattan we leased 605,000 square feet of office space with positive mark-to-market of 19.8% GAAP and 10.9% cash. In our Manhattan street retail portfolio, we leased 36,000 square feet in the quarter with positive mark-to-market of 245% cash and 65% GAAP.","In Washington, we leased 411,000 square feet of office space with negative mark-to-market of 6.5% cash and negative 4.2% GAAP. As Mitchell will tell you shortly, overall occupancy is up 80 basis points from the first quarter. And importantly, Crystal City office occupancy is up 240 basis points this quarter to 89%.","Our 220 Central Park South super-tall luxury condo project continues to set records. As of today, we have $1.6 billion sold, all but one unit of which is signed with deposits. The market continues to recognize this extraordinary product and its super location.","We expect to reach our cash target of $2 billion by the end of this year. The flood of capital, both equity and debt, from all over the globe, seeking to invest in our type and quality of assets in New York and Washington continues to be very robust, very robust, at record-breaking prices. On acquisition side, we continue to be very selective.","Let me leave you with a final thought, which bears repeating over and over again. Vornado and its management team are one of only a handful of firms who have the track record, have talent, relationships and trust in the marketplace to lease, acquire, develop, finance and manage million-foot towers and billion-dollars Fifth Avenue retail assets. It's a complicated business. Rookies need not apply.","Now, I will turn it over to Steve Theriot to cover our financial results.","Stephen Theriot","Thank you, Steve. Yesterday we reported second quarter comparable FFO of $1.30 per share, up from $1.23 per share in the prior year second quarter, a 5.7% increase. After a deeper dive, you will see that our true performance is clouded by the inclusion of gains from asset sales and mark-to-market fair value adjustments of our real estate fund.","Some might say, and Steve certainly did a minute ago, that FFO should exclude these gains, just like gains on sales of other depreciable real estate. If we were to treat earnings from the fund as not comparable, and maybe we should, comparable FFO per share this quarter would have increased 20%. Not surprisingly, most of the 20% growth comes from our very strong New York business.","Total FFO for the second quarter was $1.71 per share compared to $1.15 per share in the prior year second quarter. Non-comparable FFO items this quarter were positive $76.9 million or $0.41 per share compared to negative $15 million or $0.08 per share for the second quarter of last year.","This quarter's non-comparable FFO items include $90 million of income from the reversal of an allowance against deferred tax assets of our taxable REIT subsidiary, partially offset by $4.5 million of impairment losses and $4.1 million of acquisition-related transaction costs. Please see our press release or the overview in MD&A on Page 37 of our Form 10-Q for a detailed summary of non-comparable items.","Second quarter comparable EBITDA was $400.2 million, ahead of last year's second quarter by 1.5%. Excluding the effect of the fund, our comparable EBITDA increased 9.5%.","Our New York business produced $274.7 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, ahead of last year's second quarter by $29.5 million or 12%, driven by redeveloped properties coming back into service, primarily 7 West 34th Street, 330 West 34th Street, 280 Park Avenue and Marriott Marquis retail space at 1535 Broadway, and acquisitions such as St. Regis retail and Center Building.","Our Washington business produced $85.6 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, ahead of last year's second quarter by 1%. We continue to expect Washington's full year 2015 comparable EBITDA will be flat with 2014.","Now, turning to capital markets. In April we completed a $308 million refinancing of the RiverHouse Apartments, a three building, 1,670 unit rental complex located in Pentagon City and realized net proceeds of approximately $43 million. The loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.28% and matures in 2025. The property was previously encumbered by two loans, a 5.43% $195 million mortgage maturing in April 2015 and $64 million mortgage at LIBOR plus 1.53%, maturing in 2018.","Last week we completed a $580 million refinancing of 100 West 33rd Street, the 1.1 million square foot property comprised of 851,000 square feet of office space and the 256,000 square foot Manhattan Mall. The loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.65% and matures in July 2020. We realized net proceeds of approximately $242 million.","As of today, we have $3.1 billion of liquidity comprised of $700 million of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, and $2.4 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. Our total debt-to-enterprise value is 35.5% and our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 7.3x.","Our consolidated debt mix is balanced with fixed rate debt accounting for 73% of the total, with a weighted average rate of 4.34% and a weighted average term of 5.1 years, and floating rate debt accounting for 27% of the total with a weighted average interest rate of 2.02% and a weighted average term of 4.8 years. We have already handled all of our 2015 maturities and are working on the 26 maturities, all of which are secured debt.","I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business.","David Greenbaum","Thank you, Steve. Good morning. I'm going to begin with a brief overview of the market here in New York. The New York City economy continued to grow at a solid pace in the second quarter.","Total employment in New York City reached an all-time high of 4.2 million jobs. The unemployment rate now stands at 5.9%, down from 7.3% just one year ago. Importantly, office using employment also reached a new high of 1.3 million jobs, up 32,000 in the last 12 months.","While TAMI, technology, advertising, media and information, tenancies have been fueling the recovery, financial services tenants once again have become a leading factor in the city's economy. And over the past two years, they've added 22,000 jobs and now approach pre-recession levels. We now have a highly diversified local economy with both TAMI and the FIRE sector, financial, insurance and real estate, the two main engines driving the strong job growth in the city.","Our portfolio of properties is well-positioned across product types and submarket, and enables us to compete for tenants in both of these key sectors. Be it Facebook at 770 Broadway, Amazon at 7 West 34th Street, Neuberger Berman at 1290 Avenue of the Americans or Guggenheim Partners at 330 Madison Avenue.","The leasing market in the second quarter was highlighted by positive absorption, higher average asking rents and declining availability. And while overall Manhattan's leasing velocity is down slightly from the 2014 historic levels, it is still 11%-plus above 10-year rolling averages.","Asking rents have now increased for nine successive quarters, the longest interrupted period since 2004 to 2008. Similar to the first quarter, leasing in the FIRE sector has been particularly strong for Midtown's top-tier assets, with Midtown outperforming the general marketplace, accounting for 62% of leasing activity year-to-date.","Let me now turn to our portfolio. In the second quarter, we completed 40 office leasing transactions, a total of 605,000 square feet. Average starting rent this quarter was a very robust $82.21, the highest starting rents we have ever achieved with very strong positive mark-to-market of 19.8% GAAP and 10.9% cash.","Continuing the trend we have seen in our portfolio over the last 24 months, in this quarter 31% of our leasing activity represented tenants new to or expanding in New York; real expansion, real growth.","As expected and as I discussed in our first quarter call, our second quarter office occupancy was 96.4%, down 90 basis points, reflecting the scheduled lease expiration of the space formerly leased by Sterling Winthrop, STWB, and Sanofi at 90 Park Avenue. Sanofi and STWB, both pharmaceutical companies, moved out of their space at 90 Park Avenue over a decade ago and subleased their space to multiple tenants.","In anticipation of getting this space back, we commenced a redevelopment program at 90 Park Avenue, which is now well underway and expected to be completed by yearend. The market has responded very favorably to our dramatic new lobby and state-of-the-art mechanicals systems, similar to our recent redevelopments at 1290 Avenue of the Americas and 280 Park Avenue.","Of the 475,000 square feet of space we are getting back at 90 Park Avenue, we have already leased 230,000 square feet at cash mark-to-market of better than 25%, and leasing activity for the balance of the available space is very strong.","Our activity in the second quarter has been particularly strong with financial service tenants representing 8 of our top 10 leases. At 888 Seventh Avenue, we completed a 100,000 square foot renewal and expansion with TPG Capital, one of the country's leading private equity firms, which first took space in 888 with one floor in 2005, and now calls 888 its New York headquarters.","At 330 Madison Avenue, we completed a 41,000 square foot lease with American Century Investment Management and at 640 Fifth Avenue we completed five leases totaling 60,000 square feet, all with boutique financial services companies. At 280 Park Avenue, we signed a 43,000 square foot lease expansion with Blackstone's investment banking advisory business, soon to be spun-off to its shareholders, which now leases 142,000 square feet in the building.","At 280 Park Avenue, we also signed a 42,000 square foot lease with the government of Singapore Investment Corporation, one of the world's leading sovereign wealth funds, and a 39,000 square foot renewal expansion with Harvest Partners. With the resurgence of boutique financial services tenants, the triple-digit rental market is really active.","In the second quarter alone, we signed a total of eight leases with household names aggregating 223,000 square feet in four of our trophy buildings, 650 Madison Avenue, 640 Fifth Avenue, 888 Seventh Avenue and 280 Park Avenue, with starting rents averaging $110 a foot.","In Penn Plaza, at our recently redeveloped 330 West 34th Street, we completed a new headquarters lease with Foot Locker for 145,000 square feet. Foot Locker joins our impressively diverse tenant roster of Deutsch, Yodle and New York & Company. With this deal, the building is already 77% leased.","I want to pause to spend a minute here on the New York office same-store numbers. Historically, we have been an industry leader in our same-store results and over the past two years we have achieved same-store increases of 5%-plus GAAP and 8% cash. Our same-store office numbers for the second quarter are a positive 1.9% GAAP and 1.8% cash. Good, but not reflective of the real growth in our operating results. Let me try to explain.","Accounting conventions do not always reflect economic reality. On our last two conference calls, I discussed how our growth this year will be coming not only from same-store, but even more importantly, from placing 7 West 34th Street and 330 West 34th Street, two redevelopment properties aggregating 1.2 million square feet, back into service.","Since both of these buildings were taken out of service for redevelopment, the leasing we have completed in these buildings does not factor into our same-store numbers or into our leasing activity mark-to-market percentages.","Prior to the redevelopment, rents in 330 West 34th Street averaged $29 per square foot. With new lease starting rents after the redevelopment averaging $60 per square foot, better than a 100% mark-to-market, we are taking the EBITDA of 330 West 34th Street from $6.6 million to better than $25 million upon stabilization.","The same story is true at 7 West 34th Street. The old rents averaged $36 per square foot and after the redevelopment and landing Amazon as a tenant for the entire building. The new office rent is $62.80 per square foot, a 73% cash mark-to-market. Here we're taking the EBITDA from $9.5 million to $26 million upon stabilization.","If you were to include 7 West 34th Street and 330 West 34th Street as same-store in both the second quarter of 2014 and the second quarter of 2015, same-store New York office EBITDA for this quarter would have increased dramatically to 6.7% GAAP versus the 1.9% we reported.","Let me now turn to the street retail business. In the second quarter, we completed eight retail leases, a total of 36,000 square feet, with positive mark-to-market of 245% cash and 65% GAAP. Our Manhattan street retail platform is the largest in New York City. We have the best collection of street retail assets in only the best corridors. Up and down Fifth Avenue, Times Square at the bowtie, Madison Avenue, SoHo, Union Square and Penn Plaza. I would encourage you to take a look at our website.","When we acquired the premier St. Regis retail property on Fifth Avenue and 55th Street, what made this property so attractive to us was the short-term nature of the in-place leases, enabling us to get to the market rents quickly and the configuration of this space allowing us to create multiple smaller units.","We achieved record-breaking execution here, having completed in just four months from first showing to signed documents, two very significant 15-year leases with the Swatch Group for all of the St. Regis retail space at a cash mark-to-market of 304%. These leases are for Swatch's luxury brands, including Harry Winston.","At 1535 Broadway, the bowtie of Times Square, we recently completed another major lease with Swatch for the 45th Street corner and signage above. At 1535 Broadway we also signed a lease with Laline cosmetics, which will now be joining Invicta, T-Mobile and Swatch at this premier asset. We are in active discussions with multiple tenants for the remaining two retail stores and signage.","At 650 Madison Avenue, we bought Crate & Barrel out of a below-market lease, which was scheduled to expire in March 2019, and are undertaking a repositioning of that 61,000 square foot three-level space to a allow for multiple tenants. This quarter we signed a 9,000 square foot lease with Moncler, for a portion of that space at a cash mark-to-market increase of 461%. Think about the value creation here. The Moncler rent is more than 5.5 times the prior Crate & Barrel rent.","Let me now turn to Chicago. The Mart, our 3.6 million square foot asset, remains the hottest building located in the center of the River North market. Over the last two years, we have transformed the tenant makeup of the building, bringing in tech tenants, Motorola Mobility, PayPal, Yelp, Matter and 1871.","Just last week we completed a 72,000 square foot lease expansion with Yelp, more than doubling their space. We also completed a 40,000 square foot lease expansion with the prominent tech incubator 1871. 1871 now leases 116,000 square feet at the Mart.","Continuing the transformation of this unique asset with extraordinary floor plates, we have now taken back the entire 200,000 square foot underperforming 13th floor at the building from the giftware showroom tenants. It's actually similar to what we did here in New York with the conversion of 7 West 34 Street from a showroom building for giftware tenants to Amazon's New York headquarters. Market interest for this 13th floor at the Mart has been unprecedented. We are oversubscribed and have leases out in the Mart for over 250,000 square feet.","In San Francisco, at our 1.8 million square foot 555 California Street property, the single best building in the single hottest market in the country, we also signed just last week two market-leading leases at $100 starting rents, an 18,000 square foot relocation with Alliance Bernstein and a 6,000 square foot expansion with a mobile video game company, which you now occupies 23,000 square feet on the entire 52nd floor.","We've covered a lot of ground today, let me just reiterate a couple of our significant leasing statistics. Starting rents for the office portfolio of $82.21 on 605,000 square feet of activity, the highest starting rents we have ever achieved; 223,000 square feet of boutique financial services deals at starting rents of $110 per square foot; two retail leases on Fifth Avenue at four times the prior rent; a retail lease on Madison Avenue at 5.5 times the prior rent, all pretty stunning.","To conclude my remarks, let me say that we continue to be very constructive on the New York marketplace. Our activity is strong and our pipeline of leases is robust. We continue to realize double-digit mark-to-market on our leasing activity and the market acceptance of our redevelopment projects has been nothing short of spectacular.","We are excited about delivering our two new ground-up office developments over the next couple of years. 61 Ninth Avenue at 15th Street, immediately adjacent to the Apple Store and across the street from Chelsea Market and Google's New York headquarters and 510 West 22nd Street, directly on the high line. We are also excited about the total redevelopment of the newly acquired 260 Eleventh Avenue.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mitchell Schear to cover Washington.","Mitchell Schear","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In Washington, the economy continues to improve. Unemployment now stands at 4.8%, which is down from 5.3% a year ago and below the national average of 5.5%. A recent headline in the Washington Post read, the job market is heating up in Washington summer.","The employment story in Washington continues to be very positive. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Washington area added 68,500 jobs between June 2014 and June of 2015, the strongest period of year-over-year performance since the economy stalled.","Important for us, the most significant job growth in Washington occurred in office-using professional services, where the number of jobs grew by 16,000. According to Steven Fuller, Director of George Mason University's Center for Regional Analysis, and I'll quote, it looks like we've come to terms with the consequences of sequestration. We haven't overcome it yet, but there is at least an early sign that economy has repositioned itself. The region is figuring out how to add higher value jobs on its own.","With regard to the real estate market in the D.C. Metro area, while we're not out of the woods, the news is turning positive. For example, JLL's second quarter report on Northern Virginia reads, market posts strongest net absorption since 2010. As Steve mentioned, we can now see the green chutes.","Specifically, in our portfolio, while the leasing landscape is competitive for sure, we are encouraged by the activity and by the volume of deals we are winning. In the quarter, we leased 430,000 square feet of office and retail space in 56 transactions, bringing our year-to-date total leasing to 1.2 million square feet in 111 transactions.","Specifically, we're filling our space in Crystal City. In the second quarter alone, we completed 300,000 square feet of office leases. And thus far for the year, we have signed over 800,000 square feet in Crystal City. Our office occupancy in Crystal City is now 89.1%, up 240 basis points from Q1 and up 390 basis points so far this year.","An encouraging amount of our leasing this year represented new deals, about 200,000 square feet consisting principally of new private sector companies coming to Crystal City. Notably, associations and non-profits are migrating to Crystal City in force. In the second quarter alone, we completed nearly 100,000 square feet of new transactions with this sector.","The combination of Metro, proximity to Capitol Hill, adjacency to Reagan National Airport, and abundance of hotels and amenities plus overall value have made Crystal City their location of choice. And we continue to attract first-class eateries, whose foodie brands cater to our new urban millennial demographic. We just signed leases with Sweetgreen and Taylor Gourmet for new locations on Crystal Drive.","We're also making great progress downtown at the Warner, having signed four new leases this year, totaling 107,000 square feet, including a lease with Hewlett-Packard just signed last week, bringing the occupancy up to 86.1%. Our overall downtown portfolio, with 12 buildings and about 3.45 million square feet is solidly leased at 93% as of the end of the second quarter.","Our second quarter TIs and leasing commissions were 12.4% of initial rents or $5.02 per square foot per annum. While still higher than our historic average, we are trending down from last quarter and all of 2014. For Q2 2015 versus Q2 2014, we reported positive same-store EBITDA of 0.8% on a GAAP basis and negative 3.3% on a cash basis, both improving over last quarter's comparison, which was negative 0.2% GAAP and negative 5.5% cash.","Overall occupancy, including residential and Skyline, was up by 80 basis points from Q1 to 85%, and up by a total of 150 basis points from Q2 2014. Office occupancy, including Skyline, was up 120 basis points to 82.7% and 220 basis points above Q2 2014. And remember, a few minutes ago I said that our office occupancy in Crystal City is now 89.1%, up 390 basis points so far this year.","Skyline's occupancy is now 53.5%, a continuing drag on our overall performance. Without Skyline, our overall occupancy, including residential, is now over 91% and our office occupancy without Skyline is 89.7%.","On the residential side, we continue to show strong results. Our occupancy ticked down at quarter end to 95.4%, a short-lived blip at that moment in time. We kept our rents strong, increasing by 2.3% over Q1, and we are already back up at 96.1% occupancy as of last week.","Crystal City continues to be our greatest focus in Washington. In addition to the influx of associations and non-profits that I mentioned before, we continue to cultivate our creative cohort, and are seeing incubators, makers and startups taking root in Crystal City.","We expect the changing face of Crystal City to be enhanced even more by our new project with WeWork at 2221 South Clark Street. This former outdated office building will soon be home to more than 200 new collaborative living, community style apartments, as well as two floors of WeWork space.","If you drive by today, you will see the building's exterior has already been transformed, as we get ready for this exciting new incarnation. We are super excited about this new residential concept and look forward to its opening at the end of this year.","In addition, as we discussed last quarter, we have an exciting new partnership with 1776, a global startup incubator and seed fund that has opened a campus in our rapidly growing innovation hub in Crystal City. Their focus here is on connecting their extensive startup community to agencies and major corporations, especially in the areas of defense, aerospace and cyber.","As we've said over and over, we have tremendous value in D.C. that can be unlocked by re-leasing our vacant space as well as harvesting our robust development pipeline. We are in high creative gear on the development front.","We are finalizing our redevelopment plan for 1750 Crystal Drive. As discussed on the last call, this is a prime building in a bull's eye location that we are recapturing by moving the U.S. Marshals down the street through our recent lease. Located on Crystal Drive, right at the Metro, the building will go out of service next year, as we reposition it with a brand new skin, new lobby, new system and new spaces for delivery in 2017.","This will not only introduce fresh office product, it will be flanked by new destination retail on that block that is currently in the planning stages. This is one of several place-making concepts that we are pursuing, ideas that will not only be transformative for Crystal City, but connect to our significant assets in adjacent Pentagon City.","Our new Bartlett apartment project has topped off and is on track to be delivered in mid-2016, with a 37,000 square foot Whole Foods at the base. With 699 units, we're using our scale to create a very unique product with differentiated amenities and services. We own over 15.4 million of existing and developable square feet in Crystal City and Pentagon City, a huge swath of value creating opportunity, sitting on the shores of the Potomac.","And downtown, early in 2016, we will be demolishing two older contiguous buildings, where we will develop our new 335,000 square foot corner trophy office building, 1700 M Street. The building will be located right off Connecticut Avenue in the heart of the Central Business District. On balance, we are pleased with our second quarter and hopeful about the improving market conditions in D.C.","Thank you very much. And I now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question on line comes from Mr. Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman","I guess just sticking with Washington, D.C. for now, you you've given guidance for 2015 that you still expect EBITDA to be in line with '14. Given the leasing activity and the ins and outs of the portfolio, would you say 2016 EBITDA at this point would be higher, lower or in line with '15?","Steven Roth","We are not going to give guidance, Jamie. Good morning. We are not going to give guidance for 2016.","Jamie Feldman","I was just thinking in terms of the leases that are signed, though. If you didn't do anything else at this point.","Steven Roth","I'll say it again. We don't give guidance -- we're not going to give guidance for 2016. Obviously, from my remarks and Mitchell's remarks, we are constructive, we think Washington has bottomed. We think that it will recover. It's just a matter of time. But we're not going to do the math.","Jamie Feldman","And then for my follow-up, you had mentioned the street closure at Penn Plaza. Can you just give some early read on the feedback and how you think it's going so far? I know it hasn't been that long, but just some early sentiment.","Steven Roth","It will open at the end of the week. But I can tell you that lots of people are very excited about it. We will have food offerings, et cetera. So we're actually very excited about it.","Operator","Our next question on line comes from Manny Korchman from Citi.","Manny Korchman","Mitchell, in D.C. the leases pending balance is now just 7,000 square feet in Crystal City. Can you talk about your shadow pipeline of leases? And are we going to look at some leases that are going to be signed shortly or what does that look like?","Mitchell Schear","Sure. What you're focusing on is the metric with respect to the specific BRAC space. So if you lump all of my space together, the BRAC space and the non-BRAC space, it just so happens that that particular metric in this particular quarter was low. But as I discussed, we leased a lot of space in Crystal City and our pipeline is good. It's been as good as it's been over the last, say, two or three quarters and we're pretty constructive on the leases in the pipeline.","Manny Korchman","And Steve, given your comments on capital flows for New York, can we see you selling some more core assets or assets that you've already redeveloped and captured some of that rent upside?","Steven Roth","We have sold some assets in New York. I mean, we sold 1740 Broadway a couple of quarters ago for $1,000 a foot. So we consider each asset in our portfolio each quarter. So while we have nothing to announce now, it would not be unthinkable that we will have some capital transactions in the future. I'm not making a prediction, we have nothing in mind now, but we review everything here all the time.","Operator","Our next question on line comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore.","Steve Sakwa","Steve, I guess I'm just trying to square your comments from the last couple of quarters about just asset values being extensive. You guys have obviously put a decent amount of money to work, and I'm just trying to sort of get your views on whether you see these as kind of next cycle deals or some of these developments kind of being near term. And if you can provide any kind of all-in costs or ranges for what you think some of these assets may be and the kind of yields you're looking for?","Steven Roth","I'm not sure I understood your question, Steve. But just to talk generally about it, we have said over the last few quarters that we think asset prices are high. I have said that I think the easy money has been made in this cycle. I have said that this is a time when the smart guys are starting to build cash. I've had a handful of very, very smart guys jump on top of that comment and say they agree with me.","And I have said repeatedly that we do acquisitions very carefully at this point in the cycle. In each quarter we announce one or two acquisitions. If you look at the nature of what we're doing, they are generally what I would call bolt-on acquisitions. They are right in the neighborhoods that we are targeting.","For example, in Penn Plaza or for example in West Chelsea and multiple retail acquisitions, which we are in the market for at all times. So we are always hunting. We are always looking. We are always tasting. But elephant hunting in this market is really difficult, because prices are really high.","So I don't know if that responds directly to your question, but those are my thoughts which put it into context from the last -- actually these are valid thoughts for the last year or of so or even more.","Steve Sakwa","I guess just kind of add on to that, I was just trying to get a sense, some of these where you talk about like the 260 Eleventh Avenue, you say the lease with New York goes to 2021. There's a parking lot next to it. I presume that you're sort of land banking, if you will, for the next cycle or can you see that maybe lease be bought out and something kind of more near-term be done. And just what kind of returns are you looking for on these deals when you're stabilized?","Steven Roth","We don't publish our target returns. With respect to -- if you think about it, the asset is perfect. It was acquired for a ground lease, which is a non-cash transaction plus some shares. The income on the building covers the carryon that. We have carried from the tenant for five or six years. We will not discuss whether we can get that tenant out early or not. That's just not something that's appropriate for a call like this.","We have a record of getting our hands on assets when we want them, by the way. And we are very excited about that asset. The mark-to-market on that asset in terms of the in-place rent from the existing tenant to the market rent is way more than a double. So we love the asset. It's in a great spot and we're very constructive on it.","Steve Sakwa","And then I guess just as a follow-up, can you just maybe talk a little bit more about 220 Central Park South. And obviously you had the disclosure in the 10-Q about the sales in the 40%. Obviously, we don't know which units have been sold within the building and how maybe representative it is of an average price throughout the building. But is there any sort of information you could share at a high level, as to how to think about I guess the $1.4 billion or $1.6 billion of sales done for 40% of the space so far?","Steven Roth","The sales are actually extremely well. I don't know what the word is, up and down the building. There is not one concentration of any apartment product type that has been hotter than the others. So the sales are very evenly disbursed up and down the building.","Operator","Our next question on line comes from Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley.","Vance Edelson","With all the Amtrak and Jersey transit issues recently and talk of 100-year-old tunnels being the issue getting to Penn Station. Not to get into the politics or the potential solutions, but do you have any thoughts on the impact these issues have on the appeal of the Penn District and the impact of a new tunnel? Especially, if it led to a new destination in Manhattan, the impact that could have on the west side. So any big picture thoughts on Hudson River transit, as it relates to the Penn district?","Steven Roth","Vance, that's a little over my pay grade. But nonetheless, that hasn't made me bashful in the past. Look, Penn Station is the real McCoy. It's the largest transportation hub in the United States. It is the largest obviously serving Manhattan. And it's inconceivable -- I mean, Penn Station is the dominant transportation facility in the city. Now, it's not the only one obviously, but it's the dominant one.","The growth of the New Jersey side and the other arteries that come into Penn Station are obviously everybody knows that. The fact that the infrastructure that services Penn Station is a little bit tired, which is maybe an understatement or an overstatement, is nothing new. All of the infrastructure in New York is kind of in the same condition.","So the fact that there is a bright light on the issue of expanding Penn Station is probably a good thing. And the dominance of Penn Station is an essential element in the growth and development of the west side of Manhattan. And the fact that we own all the buildings on top of Penn Station and surrounding Penn Station, we think it is absolutely a spectacular opportunity. So I don't know whether that responds to your question, I hope it does.","Now, obviously, if there is a $5 billion, $10 billion, $15 billion construction project, which augments the dominance of Penn Station and the ability to get increasing volumes of commuter traffic into that facility, that will cause short-term disruption, but long-term enormous gain.","So we couldn't be more delighted that there is a focus on this piece of infrastructure. By the way, we believe that our political leadership and government leadership should be focusing on all of the infrastructure in New York.","Vance Edelson","And then sticking with that area on the 260 Eleventh Ave purchase, are you viewing Hudson Yards and what that will eventually become as a net positive and brings more vibrancy to the entire area? And if that's the case, what about the element of competition in coming years with all that space coming online as it relates to 260 Eleventh side, how does that work into your thinking on the acquisition?","Steven Roth","I've said publicly before, and we are obviously partners and friends with Related. I've said publicly before many times that we think that the advent of the Hudson Yards development is not a good thing for Vornado, it is a great thing for Vornado. So basically the Hudson Yards development which is now I mean in the tenth or twelfth year of this thing, this is not a new event, has put the west side of Manhattan on the map. So since we are the dominant owner in that region and since we think we have wonderfully located assets in that region, we think it's enormously to our benefit.","Well, let me get to 260, okay. We had an interesting thing happen about a year ago and that is a very important tech firm, a very important tech firm named Facebook, came into New York and wanted to expand and enlarge their New York headquarters. They started with a small space of 50,000 feet, and they wanted to expand greatly which is appropriate, because they need a large presence in New York. Now, these guys are really efficient.","And they came into town with a team. They surveyed the marketplace. In like one week they selected their top two candidates for their new, New York headquarters. One of which was ours 770 Broadway, which is a wonderful building with 77,000 square foot floor plates, high ceilings, lots of glass and a traditional -- it was a department store, which David and his team converted into a first class office space. In any event, so the choice was down to 770 Broadway or a new steel and glass building in a very similar neighborhood and they selected our building and we're finding that kind of thing happening all through the city.","So it's not by chance that the buildings on Park Avenue South and the 260 Eleventh Avenue type buildings are in incredibly high demand by the class of tenant that doesn't want to work in a class building with a lot of old guys that wear ties of which I am one, by the way. So we relish the competition.","Now, if you talk about the new space that Related is going to be bringing to market, that's a totally different kind of space than we offer. They're looking for 0.5 million and 1 million foot tenants. They need those tenants to fill those big, giant buildings up with those big giant financial services floor plates and the city needs them.","We can operate wonderfully under the umbrella of their pricing and we will draft from what they do. So we think they're coming into the market -- this is going to sound a little silly, coming into our neighborhood is a great thing, and we couldn't be more pleased about the future. Well, that was a little too much, not my style, a little too much propaganda, but there you have it.","Operator","Our next question online comes from Ryan Peterson from Sandler O'Neill.","Ryan Peterson","Just a quick question on 260 Eleventh. So you purchased that on a ground lease. Does fee simple still pencil in this environment or will we continue to see ground lease deals?","Steven Roth","Basically the ground lease was a surrogate for the passage of time. We have a fixed price purchase option that is locked out until the happening of certain events, which I'm not going to mention here, but we will in the future buy the fee, which is what our intention is.","Ryan Peterson","And then one other quick question. The DTA, you recognized $90 million of $95 million. Is there any reason in particular that you didn't recognize the whole $95 million?","Steven Roth","Steve Theriot will take that one.","Stephen Theriot","The reason there is there was a recent change in the New York state law around utilization of net operating losses that limit our ability to use certain of those NOLs in New York State and that's what caused the $5 million not to be recognized currently. We hope to realize that in the future, but it will not be realized through the 220 development.","Operator","Our next question online comes from John Bejjani from Green Street Advisors.","John Bejjani","Steve, there has been talk recently of slowing New York City tourism in light of currency and other global economic issues.","Steven Roth","I'm sorry, say that again, John, I didn't hear you.","John Bejjani","Sorry, I was saying there's been talk recently of slowing New York City tourism in light of currency and other global economic issues. So on the street retail front, are you seeing or do you expect to see any change in behavior from either potential tenants or landlords and the rents they're looking for?","Steven Roth","Some of our colleagues have already opined on that with a negative answer. I'll be a little bit different. We don't have yet the tourism statistics recently, but I believe that there is a slight, I'm talking about really slight diminution in tourism. Now, you have to remember that there's 55, I think million tourists that come into New York last year at the running rate 80% of which are domestic tourists. So those are not affected by the change in, by the strength or weakness of the dollar.","So it's 20% of that tourism cohort, which would be, let's say, 11 million or 10 million individuals. And so at the margin, it's not going to be that significant. We do know that tourism is still continuing to be on the rise, because the wonders of New York continue to attract people from all over the world. So while sort of my belly tells me there's going to be a diminution, it's going to be at the margin I think very slight. That's step number one.","Notwithstanding that, I've said this before on prior calls, I think retail rents have gotten to be very high and I think that landlords will -- and the number of tenants cruising, looking for spaces at these very highest in cycle rents are starting to decline. So I know we're recognizing that and we're making deals. And the deals are, as David said, in his mark-to-markets and what we're doing, the performance and the results and the financial value creation is still acceptable to extraordinary.","So the answer is, is we are realists. We understand what the markets are. We don't hang out asking rents that are not obtainable in the marketplace and our job is to take this wonderful street retail portfolio and keep it rented at rents, which in relation to our costs are nothing short of extraordinary.","Now, in my letter to shareholders, the most recent one, which went out in the spring, there were two very dense pages on the street retail business, which had a lot of words and also a lot of numbers. We traced out over a 10 or 15 year period what the increases in street retail rents had been by submarket and they are high-double digits and they are just extraordinary. Just for fun, we put in what the similar statistics were for office space by submarket and they were obviously much less than retail.","We also put in, in that same letter that I'm referring to, lots of data on recent transactions on Fifth Avenue, just to get an idea of the math, and so we think that we benefit enormously from being early with large and important assets on Fifth Avenue and in other submarkets. So that's where we have extraordinary value.","So anyway, that's a long-winded answer to say basically that I sense in my belly that rents have gotten to the top of the market and we are in the business of realism, not hoping, and we are in the business of making deals. The deals that we're making have extraordinary mark-to-markets so they're pretty darn good.","John Bejjani","And then, Mitchell, can you please discuss the traction Crystal City's getting as a tech hub versus other submarkets like the Mt. Vernon Triangle. It seems the bulk of leasing this year has been nonprofits and associations, which seems it might be a little at odds with creating a tech ecosystem.","Mitchell Schear","The way that I think about the Crystal City market is it really has four legs to it. So we continue to be a strategic location for government. We continue to be a strategic location for government contractors. We think that the not for profit and 501C3 cohort is another leg, and finally, the innovative and creative type.","So I think they all intermix with one another and particularly if you focus on some of the start-ups and the innovative companies that are working with the big, big government prime contractors as well as the big government agencies, there really is natural synergy amongst and within those groups.","So I think that the four pieces sort of fit within one another and then when you think of some of the 501C3s and nonprofits, many of them have youthful and millennial cohorts who are doing research and other kinds of work for the organization. So when you add them all up, I think you get a good and robust mix of tenants and there's synergies amongst the groups as well.","Operator","Our next question online comes from Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs.","Brad Burke","I was little surprised with the cash balance at the end of the quarter. I know you have previously spoken about ending the year with about $2 billion in cash. So I was just hoping for an update on how you're thinking about ending the year in terms of cash now and how we should think about you getting there from where you're at, at the end of the second quarter?","Stephen Theriot","We ran down our cash to handle, for example, the St. Regis acquisition, which was $700 million, which we basically bought for cash and we have no financing on it. So that asset will be financed shortly and there are several other assets that are similar. So basically we ran down our cash. We will run it back up again. We are on track.","Brad Burke","What would be a level that we should think about you being comfortable at this kind of a run rate?","Stephen Theriot","Gee, I don't know. I could tell you kind of perversely, as the cycle continues and gets more and more, where prices get more and more, I don't want to use the word bubbly, but I will, then we feel that there maybe more opportunities coming for the well-capitalized cash heavy, very liquid firms on the other side of that. So that's not an answer, but it is in a kind of a funny way an answer.","But we have no target. We have no budget for cash. We believe that having liquidity to be able to take advantage of the opportunities that will undoubtedly be here, we don't know when, is a very important part of the strategy of how a firm such as ours should be run.","Brad Burke","And then I had just another question on 220 Central Park South. It still looks like you have over $800 million to complete the project, which seems like a lot to do between now and the end of 2016. So just wanted to get an update on how you're thinking about timing of completion and whether there's any downside to the expected completion cost, and also if you can tell us how you're thinking about funding the construction from here on out.","Steven Roth","The completion date of the project remains unchanged. The construction market in New York is very, very, very, very tight. People are experiencing shortages, which causes price disruption all the time. We have bought more than 50% of the project and so we're very respectful of what might happen in terms of the costs of the remainder of it.","Not concerned about it, just attentive to it. We will finance the project out of the existing loans we have on it, plus a new loan that we are going to take to finance the remainder of it.","Brad Burke","Is that the mezzanine loan that you've talked about previously or was this something new beyond that?","Steven Roth","I'm not going to comment on that.","Operator","Our next question online comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Just a couple of quick questions here. Just on the WeWork's project in DC, I know it's going to start delivering here in the end of the year, but when do you think WeWork's will be able to start leasing the residential units?","Mitchell Schear","So the units are going to deliver late this year, very early next year, and will be immediately in the market to lease them at that juncture.","Vincent Chao","But at this point they're not being marketed as of yet?","Mitchell Schear","Correct.","Vincent Chao","Just another quick one on WeWork. They've been in the news quite a bit. You and many of your peers are leasing space to them. I guess, if that is directionally where the office market or some portion of the office market is heading, obviously you don't want to create conflicts of interests with your own tenants, but just curious if that's something you would ever consider doing on your own separate from WeWork, some kind of space similar to that.","Steven Roth","The question that, are we considering doing a look alike to WeWork ourselves in our own -- ","Vincent Chao","Well, would you ever consider something like that, I guess, yes, that is the question.","Steven Roth","We would consider it, but we likely wouldn't do it. We're very comfortable with leases from important tenants with credit, et cetera, as opposed to leasing out the space desk-by-desk. And so we think that WeWork is very, very competent at it. That's a different business. That's not to say that WeWork might not attract a handful or two handfuls of competitors. But it likely would not be us.","Operator","Our next question online comes from Ross Nussbaum from UBS.","Ross Nussbaum","Can you talk a little bit about the multifamily business? As I strategically think about it you've got about 4,000 apartment units between New York and DC, and back of the envelope we're probably talking somewhere around $2 billion or north of $2 billion asset value. Where does that fit in as you think about this company going forward? We spent an hour and 15 minutes on the phone here, and multifamily maybe got a minute of time from Mitchell. Is this something that's still on the plate for, I would say, strategic disposition or how were you thinking about that?","Steven Roth","We are an accidental participant in the residential business, if I can use that word. So what do I mean by that? In New York, we have two large, I mean, really large and important projects that are basically, what do you call it assistant housing kinds of projects where we bought, together with a partner who was the original owner of this inventory.","Independence Plaza is the main one, which is, what is it 1,500 units, how many units is it, 1,328 units in Tribeca on the water, with high rises directly across the street from -- what's the name of Di Niro's restaurant? [multiple speakers] See, they don't let me out very often. So a spectacularly well located project. And we bought it at, I don't know, $0.25 on the dollar for per square foot per pound, and so what we're doing there is over time the rents will rise, et cetera. Enough said about that.","So we invested in a residential product, but we did what we frequently do. We were very price sensitive, et cetera. So that's said enough of that. We also have an apartment project on 86th and Lexington, which is an important piece of property, which we bought because it was on top of the retail that we sought. So I'm saying this is sort of incidental into this business. We also have a couple of handfuls in New York again apartments in places like SoHo where they came along with retail assets that we acquired.","So that's the current nature of our residential business in Manhattan. Would we get larger in Manhattan if the opportunity came up? Absolutely, yes. We're also by the way building a 300 unit apartment project in Rego Park, Queens, which is an Alexander's asset on top of the large and very successful Rego Par shopping center. So we understand the apartment business. We understand it and have capability both from an operating point of view and a development point of view.","But we have entered it by being very, very, very -- looking for economic value as opposed to going in and paying 3 caps for assets. We also have in New York built the three condo projects, one of which was on top of the Ethical Culture School on Fifth Avenue. The other one of which is on Central Park West.","The other one of which of course is the Beacon Court project on top of the Bloomberg Tower, and then the third of which is the stunningly successful 220 Central Park South project, which is an interesting comment for me to make. It's four stories out of the ground and I'm saying it's stunningly successful and it is.","In Washington, most of the residential that we have fits into two categories, one, we acquired land in the Eighth Street acquisition, which was, I don't know, six, seven, eight years ago and that land came along with it and we got 1500 units, the River House Apartments in that acquisition.","We also got three or four land parcels, which are stunningly well located in Pentagon City, basically across the street from the Pentagon City Mall, which we own about 7.5% of. And then we basically did two or three conversions of existing buildings in the Washington portfolio to create value and to engage in place making into the communities that we are.","So we're in the business. You're right, we have 4,000 units on. We will build those units out over time. We're building an important project now, which is the Bartlett, which has 700 units. We say in all our documents 699 units, which I think is kind of kooky, let's call it 700 units, plus the Whole Foods, et cetera.","We know the business. We're successful at it. We know how to operate the buildings. We know how to develop the buildings. We will do more of this and build out our inventory. What will happen -- by the way, we will do more place making and resi construction in Crystal City overtime. We will convert some of the office buildings into tear-downs or conversions and do resi. Will we go in and buy a big apartment company? No. Will we do acquisitions in the business? Maybe.","Ross Nussbaum","I guess we're not selling. The second question -- ","Steven Roth","The answer to that is, is we might sell. We might bring in -- we might likely bring in a JV partner to finance all of this, okay. But we won't sell raw land and low prices.","Ross Nussbaum","Second question is Hotel Penn. Obviously, hotel performance in New York has been a little weak lately. Does that cause you -- plus your long-term plans with the plaza, how much longer is Hotel Penn going to be a hotel? Are we going to resurrect the architect plans from the Merrill building at some point?","Steven Roth","You know, we can't predict the future. We can only say that, yes, the hotel business in New York is soft. I think the folks tell me that New York is the only hotel market in the United States which has negative comps. I mean which is pretty startling, because it is the principal tourist attraction in the United States.","But what's going on in New York is just oversupply, oversupply, oversupply. And when new entries open up, they cut the prices to get to stabilization and so whatever. Our numbers are lower. They are not seriously lower. They are what 5%, 7% lower, something like that. So we understand what's going on. So basically the Hotel Penn is either a hotel or a place saver as we see it. And as markets change, I can tell you that we have an enormous profit in the hotel now. We can tell the asset for an enormous profit.","We believe that there is much more to come. We are unable to make a commitment now as to whether it's going to go into a teardown or a renovation. We are also unable to make a commitment now, as to whether it's going to go for a hotel use or an office use or whatever. We have all kinds of different conversations going on. I can only tell you one thing with incredible sincerity, it will be well worth the wait.","Now, there is lots of things that we do that maybe take a while, where we have patience. It took eight years to assemble the 220 Central Park South site. And that will be well, well, well worth the wait. Hotel Penn fits into that category as well. Let's take one more question.","Operator","Our final question comes from Manny Korchman from Citi.","Michael Bilerman","It's Michael Bilerman. Just a question on equity. And I recognize for 260 Eleventh Avenue doing units was an advantage and necessary to get that deal done. But in contrast of your comment last quarter, I think when asked about the stock, and you said you hated your stock price. How do you think about issuing at these levels, number one? And number two, more broadly about potential strategic things you may be thinking about to improve the stock.","Steven Roth","First of all, I hate my stock price about $5 or $6 or $7 more than I hated it last quarter, number one. Number two is the shares that were issued in the 260 Eleventh Avenue acquisition had to be issued for tax purposes. It was the only way to make the deal. We have a long and deep relationship with this same group of sellers. I think I said or David said, I don't remember who, that this is the same group that we bought 770 Broadway from.","And so while I hate putting out shares and won't put out shares at this price, $80 million of shares even if it's issued at a discount to what it's really worth in relation to the quality of the asset and the opportunity of creating that was we thought worth it, and it had to be in that transaction. I can tell you that from a policy point of view and a discipline point of view, we have no plans, and I almost want to say we won't issue shares at these prices.","By the way, I almost would say that we have an extreme aversion to issuing shares almost at any price. That's a little silly. I mean there is a price. But understand that when we look at issuing shares is basically dilutive to our shareholders, and we don't look at the dilution in terms of what the current NAV is, we look at what the future NAV of the company would be two, thee, four, five, 10 years down the line. So issuing shares is not something that we think is a good strategy.","With respect to the fact that our shares, together with almost everybody's shares, sell at a pretty significant discount to the private market values, and what we're going to do about that, the answer is, is we together with every management team in our industry is trying to figure that out right now.","So we have shown -- our management team and Board has shown a willingness to do things, get out of the mall business, get out of the strip business, get out of the merchandise mart business, et cetera, et cetera, spin off our strip shopping center business to our shareholders. We have been I think more active than any other management team I think in terms of restructuring our company. As I've said before, everything is on the table and everything continues to be on the table.","Michael Bilerman","Would you have considered, and I recognize the units are tax benefit and were necessary for the deal. And I guess would you have considered just buying back $80 million of your common shares to effectively make it neutral and recognize. I know the stock's not at a meaningful, meaningful enough discount to do a large scale buyback, but I'm just wondering with the cash balances, the refinancing proceeds, the asset sale proceeds, whether that was something you talked about and thought about of effectively keeping the equity base totally the same?","Steven Roth","Michael, I never thought of that. I never thought of it.","Michael Bilerman","I guess you can do it now, if you want.","Steven Roth","I'm not saying we're going to do it now, but I do say we never thought of it.","Michael Bilerman","Just a question on retail. I think in your opening comments you said, you talked about the retail rents and said there was more to come. There's about 60,000 square feet of retail expiring in the back half or under month-to-month and another I think 90,000 next year. Are you pulling forward some larger deals from future years or is there a certain volume that we should be thinking about relative to I think you've done about 40,000 square feet of retail leasing at obviously multiples in terms of spreads?","Steven Roth","I really wasn't focusing on the renewals or re-renting the expiries, as they come off. I was really thinking about some of the stuff. We have a couple of important assets that are currently treading water, I'm more focused on those.","Michael Bilerman","And then just about one last comment. You forgot Independence is across from Citigroup's headquarters. We're investing some billions of dollars and moving a lot of employees that eventually will need a place to rent their apartment to be close to work. So that's it.","Steven Roth","One of your guys at Citi approached me about taking down one of the buildings and building a hotel for them at bargain prices. And we didn't think -- I don't know. We couldn't be more aware of the fact that Citi headquarters is adjacent to our Independence Plaza. I think that's it.","Operator","At this time, I see we have no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Roth for any closing comments.","End of Q&A","Steven Roth","Thank you all very much. This was an-hour-and-a-half, so I appreciate you sticking with us for that time. Maybe next quarter we'll try and make it a little bit more succinct and be a little bit more cognizant of your time pressure. So anyway, thank you, we'll see you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"21965":["Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) Q1 2015 Earnings Call May  5, 2015 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Catherine Creswell - ","Steven Roth - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Executive Committee","Stephen W.

My name is Ellen, and I will be your operator for today's call. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Catherine Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust's First Quarter Earnings Call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our first quarter earnings release and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents as well as our supplemental financial information package are available on our website, www.vno.com, under the Investor Relations section.

Also in the room is Joseph Macnow, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer. Michael Franco, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer is on jury duty and is not with us today.","I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's first quarter call. It has been just 3 weeks since the release of my annual letter to shareholders, so my opening remarks this morning will be brief.","Starting with recent acquisitions. In January, we increased our ownership interest in the Times Square Crowne Plaza property to 33% from [ph] 11%. This property located at 48th Street and Broadway is comprised of a 795-key hotel, 7,700 square feet of prime retail space signage, 197,000 square feet of office space and a 159-space parking garage.","In March, we completed the previously announced acquisition of the Center Building, an 8-story 437,000-square-foot office building located on Northern Boulevard in Long Island City, New York. This building is 98% leased. The purchase price was $142 million, including the assumption of an existing $62 million 4.43% mortgage maturing on October 2018.","In April, we entered into a joint venture in which we have a 55% interest, which we'll develop a 173,000-square-foot Class A office building on the western side of the High Line at 510 West 72nd Street. And remember, we are also developing a 130,000-square-foot newbuild in a venture in the same part of town at 61 Ninth Avenue at 15th Street.","Now to dispositions. In March, we completed the transfer of Springfield Town Center to PREIT. Proceeds to us were $485.3 million comprised of $340 million in cash and 6,250,000 common units valued at $23.25 per share -- per unit, actually, or $145.3 million, which I might mention is $20 million above the collared $20 per-unit price in the deal. The units are tax-protected in favor of our original seller and, accordingly, are not currently for sale.","In March, our real estate fund sold 520 Broadway in Santa Monica, California, for $91.7 million, realizing a $24.7 million net gain over the holding period. During the first quarter, we sold 6 non-Manhattan retail assets, properties that were not transferred to Urban Edge and which were classified as held-for-sale on our balance sheet for aggregate proceeds of $45 million.","Now to operations. We had a very strong first quarter, and I'm very pleased with our financial results. Our first quarter comparable FFO was $1.10 per share, 11.1% higher than last year's first quarter. Company-wide, in the quarter, we leased 1,541,000 square feet at 132 transactions. In Manhattan, we leased 553,000 square feet of office space with positive mark-to-markets of 17.1% cash and 18.2% GAAP.","A couple of weeks ago and not included in the first quarter leasing activity I just mentioned, we completed two 15-year leases for all of the space at our St. Regis retail property on 5th Avenue at 55th Street that we had acquired just 5 months ago. The tenant is Swatch Group for its luxury brands, including Harry Winston. These large and important leases were completed in the 5 short months since we acquired the property. What made this property so attractive to us was the short-term nature of the in-place leases enabling us to get to market rents quickly as well as, of course, its prime pitch location on 5th Avenue as well as the physical configuration of the space, which is perfect for creating small boutique stores for luxury retailers.","These leases more than achieved our underwriting and will have a mark-to-market cash increase of 400% when we report them next quarter. The leases will commence when the incumbent tenant leases expire. Our strategy here was to sell a generic 1950s office building, 1740 Broadway, and reinvest the proceeds from the sale through a like-kind exchange into the St. Regis retail, a much higher quality totally unique 5th Avenue retail asset. We will also achieve slightly higher initial yields on the new property and expect much higher growth prospects. We think this was a spectacular trade for us.","I am delighted to announce that Edward P. Hogan Jr. is joining Vornado as head of retail leasing. Ed will be responsible for leasing, asset management, redeveloping and growing our best-in-class Manhattan retail portfolio, which today encompasses 2.8 million square feet in 61 properties concentrated in the principal shopping districts of Madison Avenue, 5th Avenue, Times Square, 14th Street, Penn Plaza, Herald Square and SoHo. Ed is trained as an architect and will be part of the leadership team working to transform our vast holdings in the Penn Plaza District. He comes to us following a stellar 19-year career at Brookfield Office Properties and its predecessors, where he served as National Director of Retail Leasing.","Among his many accomplishments there, Ed led the team that created the merchandise plan and executed the leasing of the highly successful just-opened 375,000-square-foot retail center at the base of Brookfield Place in Lower Manhattan, which project features many luxury retail tenants and expensive food offerings. Ed will be succeeding Sherri White, who after a 13-year successful career with us will be leaving Vornado for a senior position at the Witkoff Group. Thanks to Sherri for all she has done, and we wish her all good luck.","In our Washington, D.C., portfolio, we leased 754,000 square feet of office space with negative mark-to-market of 17.6% cash and 17.0% GAAP. Excluding the U.S. Marshal's lease, which was a large and very important retention to work for us -- a very important retention for us, the mark-to-markets would have been negative 0.4%, basically 40 bps cash, and negative 3.1% GAAP.","I will sum up as I wrote in my letter shareholders. I am delighted with the scale, speed and financial outcome of our simplification program. I am very constructive on New York, where demand activity and absorption are accelerating and where office rents are now rising.","With respect to Washington, we are confident that we will do very well in Washington as, over time, we raise the occupancy rate and income level back to normal. And we will continue to execute on the trove of development opportunities we have in both Washington and New York.","One last comment with respect to our 220 Central Park South super-tall luxury condo project. Pending the completion of our full marketing center, which will be completed later this year, we have opened a small sales gallery to a limited audience. In just 6 short weeks, without any advertising, marketing or outreach whatsoever, we have already -- we already have commitments for over $1.1 billion representing about 1\/3 of the building. So 1\/3 of the building is now sold. We will be delivering here the best-ever residences in terms of location, Central Park views, amenities, design and detail. Acceptance by brokers and buyers has been extraordinary and unprecedented.","One last comment before I turn it over to Steve to cover our financial results. We have on the line in his role as a retired investor one Ross Morrison. So this is the first time in 31 years that Ross is on the other end of the phone as opposed to sitting right here next to me. Good morning, Ross.","Now I'll turn it over to Steve.","Stephen W. Theriot","Thank you, Steve. And I'll pile on, good morning, Ross. Yesterday, we reported first quarter comparable FFO of $1.10 per share, up from $0.99 per share in the prior year's first quarter, an 11.1% increase. Total FFO for the first quarter was $1.16 per share compared to $1.31 per share in the prior year's first quarter. On January 15, we completed the spinoff of Urban Edge Properties. The results of UE are included in discontinued operations in all periods presented and are excluded from our comparable results.","First quarter comparable EBITDA was $358.5 million, ahead of last year's first quarter by 4.9%. Our New York business produced $248.9 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, ahead of last year's first quarter by 9.3%, driven in almost equal measures by increases in same-store, property acquisitions and redeveloped properties coming back into service. Our Washington business produced $83.3 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, lower than last year's first quarter by a scant 1%. We expect Washington's 2015 comparable EBITDA will be flat with 2014.","Let me spend a minute on our 25% owned real estate fund. In the first quarter, the fund sold 520 Broadway, located in Santa Monica, California, and we recognized our share of the net gain and carried interest of $6.1 million. During 2014, the fund sold One Park Avenue and its 50% interest in the shops at Georgetown Park, and we recognized our share of the net gains and carried interest of $43.9 million. We do not expect further net gains and carried interest from asset sales during the remainder of 2015.","General and administrative expenses in this year's first quarter included $11.1 million from the acceleration in the timing of the recognition of compensation expense resulting from a change in the vesting criteria of awards in our outperformance plans, such that they fully vest at age 65. This is only timing as the accelerated expense results in lower general and administrative expense during the remainder of 2015 of $3.2 million and $7.9 million thereafter.","Noncomparable FFO items this quarter were positive $11.5 million or $0.06 per share of income compared to positive $63 million or $0.31 per share of income for the first quarter of last year. This quarter's noncomparable FFO items include $23.3 million of net gains from the sale of nondepreciable assets and $8.6 million of FFO from discontinued operations partially offset by $24.6 million of onetime transaction costs almost entirely related to the UE spinoff. Please see our press release or overview and MD&A on Page 34 of our Form 10-Q for a detailed summary of noncomparable items.","Now turning to capital markets. In January, when they first became freely repayable, we repaid the $500 million of 4 1\/4% senior unsecured notes due April 2015. In April, we completed a $308 million refinancing of urban house apartments, a 3-building 1,670-unit rental complex located in Arlington, Virginia, and realized net proceeds of approximately $43 million. The loan is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.28% and matures in 2025. The property was previously encumbered by a 5.43% $195 million mortgage maturing in April 2015 and a $64 million mortgage at LIBOR plus 1.53% maturing in 2018. As of today, we have $3.5 billion in liquidity comprised of $1 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities with no outstandings.","Our total debt-to-enterprise value is 32.2%, and our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 7x. Our debt mix is balanced with fixed-rate debt accounting for 77% of the total with a weighted average rate of 4.37% and a weighted average term of 5.2 years and floating rate debt accounting for 23% of the total with a weighted average interest rate of 2.32% and a weighted average term of 4.2 years. Our remaining 2015 maturities total just $229 million.","I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business.","David R. Greenbaum","Steve, thank you. My remarks this morning will be brief reflecting that our year end call was just some 10 weeks ago. On that call, we discussed the detailed overview of the Manhattan marketplace for 2014, which focused on the job growth in the creative industries, which has been fueling the continued growth of TAMI tenants: technology, advertising, media and information.","The first quarter of the new year started off with leasing activity in Manhattan dominated by what I call the traditional industry, the FIRE tenants: financial services, insurance and real estate. In our own portfolio, some 60% of our leasing activity was with financial services tenants. In the first quarter, we completed 42 office leasing transactions, a total of 553,000 square feet. Our first quarter occupancy was 97.3%, up 40 basis points from the fourth quarter. Average starting rent this quarter was a robust $77.85 with a very strong positive mark-to-market of 18.2% GAAP and 17.1% cash.","Continuing the trend we have seen in our portfolio over the last 12 months, in this quarter, 45% of our leasing activity represented tenants new to or expanding in New York; as I call it, real expansion, real growth. The high-end market also has remained very active. Since the beginning of the year, taking into account signed deals and leases currently out for signature, we have a total of 300,000 square feet of leasing activity in 13 separate leases at average starting rents north of $105 per square foot. These triple-digit leases are in 6 different buildings in our portfolio, each a trophy property.","Our activity has been particularly strong at the newly transformed 280 Park Avenue, including 2 major financial services leases, one with Franklin Templeton for 127,000 square feet and the other with a growing investment bank, PJT Partners, for 99,000 square feet, which is gearing up for a major expansion and its announced spinoff to Blackstone Group shareholders.","In addition, at 280 Park Avenue, we now have leases out on another 125,000 square feet, 2 with tenants expanding and the third with an outside new tenant. Since we acquired the building in 2011 with these additional new leases, we will have leased 838,000 square feet at 280 Park Avenue. Our renovation program has been a resounding success.","At 90 Park Avenue, where our capital program to reposition the building is just now underway, FactSet expanded its headquarters lease with us by 20,000 square feet and now occupies 122,000 square feet. Through the end of the year, we will be getting back some 145,000 square feet in this building formerly leased by Sanofi and Sterling Winthrop, STWB. We are well positioned to re-lease the space as the building transformation program is scheduled to be completed by year end and expect mark-to-markets in excess of 20%. I should note that we expect occupancy in the portfolio will trend somewhat lower by as much as 150 basis points over the course of the year reflecting these scheduled expirations at 90 Park Avenue.","In Midtown South at 770 Broadway, we signed an 80,000-square-foot expansion with Facebook. In May of 2013, Facebook signed their initial lease at 770 Broadway for about 100,000 square feet. Over the past 20-plus months, Facebook has now expanded to 270 -- 275,000 square feet; truly incredible growth.","In the first quarter, we completed 6 small retail leases with a positive market-to-market of 37.1% GAAP and 16.8% cash. This leasing does not include the St. Regis retail leasing in April that Steve talked about earlier. At 1535 Broadway, the bow tie of Times Square, we completed a lease with Invicta watches, which will be joining T-Mobile at this premier asset. We remain in active discussions with multiple tenants for the remaining retail stores and signage.","Turning now to our 1.8 million square foot 555 California Street in San Francisco. We completed a 53,000-square-foot renewal and expansion with top international law firms Sidley Austin at a 57% mark-to-market. At The Mart, a 3.5-million-square-foot building located at the center of the hot Chicago River North market, Yelp expanded and now leases 60,000 square feet. Over the last 2 years, we have transformed the tenant makeup of the building bringing in tech tenants, Motorola Mobility, Braintree, Yelp, MATTER and 1871.","Just last week at a dinner with all the major leasing brokers in Chicago, we launched our redevelopment plans, the next step in the reinvention of the iconic Mart. We are adding new life to the first 2 floors of the building with dramatic communal spaces, including a grand stair with bleacher seating for our tenants to congregate and as a presentation venue along with new food options, including a reimagined food hall, a caf\u00e9 with outdoor seating overlooking the Chicago River and a food truck park on the river promenade. The plan has been incredibly well received, and we are actively working on several significant transactions with brand-name tech tenants.","To conclude my remarks, let me summarize the entire New York division. We had a very strong quarter with same-store EBITDA increases for the overall division of 5.5% cash and 3.2% GAAP. Isolating just the New York Office business, our same-store EBITDA increased 4% cash and 1.5% GAAP. Let me spend a minute commenting on that. I mentioned this in our fourth quarter call in addition. In the first quarter and for the balance of 2015, in addition to the same-store EBITDA increase, growth, just as importantly, will be coming from placing 280 Park Avenue, 7 West 34th Street and 330 West 34th Street back into service.","In summary, we continue to be very constructive on the New York marketplace. Our portfolio is full. We continue to realize double-digit mark-to-markets on our leasing activity. Our activity remains strong, and our pipeline of leases is robust.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Mitchell Schear to cover Washington.","Mitchell N. Schear","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In Washington, we continue to see signs of an improving economy. Unemployment has dropped again to 4.7%, which is down from 5.2% a year ago and below the national average of 5.5%. Jobs continue to grow with 50,700 jobs added from March to March. Importantly, office-using professional and business services grew by 12,900 jobs, a marked improvement from last year where the number was negative.","While it will take more time for the recovery in the economy to translate into robust demand and rent growth, we believe the tide is shifting and the worst is behind us in D.C. Specifically, in our portfolio, we continue to expect our EBITDA for 2015 to be about even with 2014. We had a strong volume of leasing in the first quarter. In the quarter, we leased 763,000 square feet of office and retail space in 55 transactions. About 70% of this was in new leasing and 30% represents renewals. Our biggest deal was the new lease signed for 371,000 square feet for the U.S. Marshals headquarters in Crystal City.","As we mentioned in our last call, the Marshals have been our tenant in Crystal City for the last 15 years, and it was important that we retain them for another 15 years. We relocated them from 1750 Crystal Drive down several blocks to our building at 1215 South Clark Street. We took them from a building in a bull's-eye location right at the metro and at our main entrance to Crystal City and moved them to a less prime location at 1215 South Clark. This was the building that Boeing vacated in the first quarter.","As a reminder, Boeing moved just down the street in Crystal City into a new headquarters that they built and own. So we're delighted to have both resolved Boeing's vacancy in our gateway buildings and freed up one of our best buildings right at the Metro for re-leasing. More on that in the development story, which I will get to in just a minute.","I mentioned the Marshals specifically, not only because it was the largest transaction in the region so far this year but also because, frankly, it skewed our metrics a bit. Overall, office leases signed in the first quarter generated a GAAP mark-to-market of negative 17% and a cash mark-to-market of negative 17.6%. These results are heavily weighted downward by the U.S. Marshals' lease. Boeing's rent had grown significantly during the short-term extension, and we needed to be aggressive to win the Marshals' competition. As you would expect, we had a significant roll down in rent on this big deal. Without the Marshals deal, the cash mark-to-market on the remaining 403,000 square feet of leasing in the quarter was basically flat, down 0.4%.","The deals in the D.C. market continue to require significant TIs. TIs and leasing commissions for the leases we signed during the first quarter were 21.7% of initial rents or $7.60 per square foot per annum as compared to Q4 2014 at 17.7% and $6.54 per square foot. Once again, the U.S. Marshals deal required TIs that were higher than normal at $8.19 per square foot or 25.6%. Without the Marshals deal, our first quarter metrics would have been 16% of initial rents or $6.16 per square foot per annum, better than the Q4 2014 metrics.","For Q1 2015 versus Q1 2014, we reported negative same-store EBITDA of minus 0.2% GAAP and minus 5.5% cash. Overall occupancy, including residential and Skyline, was up by 40 basis points from Q4 2014 to 84.2%, and up by 90 basis points from Q1 2014. Office occupancy, including Skyline, was up 60 basis points to 81.5% and a full 100 basis points above Q1 2014. Skyline's occupancy fell to 53.4%, an obvious drag on our overall performance. Without Skyline, our overall occupancy, including residential, is now 90.1%, and our office occupancy is 88.2%. Crystal City's office occupancy rose by 150 basis points to 86.7%.","So our policy to provide enhanced disclosure on BRAC space. For Q1 2015, we resolved another 123,000 square feet of BRAC space, almost all of it in Crystal City. As a result, in Crystal City, we have now resolved 1.2 million of the 1.4 million square feet of BRAC space. Overall, we have now resolved almost 70% of the original 2.4 million square feet of BRAC space. Of the remaining 742,000 square feet to resolve, almost 60% of it or 430,000 square feet is in Skyline. So that's where we are on our office leasing. On the residential side, we continue to be pleased. We are full with occupancy at 97.1%.","Crystal City continues to be our greatest focus in Washington. Here's what's happening. First, we've seen an increasing influx of associations and nonprofits. Crystal City is a great alternative to D.C. for these organizations. The combination of Metro, proximity to Capitol Hill, adjacency to Reagan National Airport and abundance of hotels, our wide cadre of amenities have made Crystal City the location of choice for over 40 associations and nonprofits. In addition, Crystal City is a great value play for the associations and nonprofits. In 2014, we did 190,000 square feet of leasing in Crystal City to associations and nonprofits, and thus far in 2015, we have an additional 116,000 square feet of leases either signed or currently pending.","Next, we're focused on creative innovation in Crystal City. As has been widely reported on April 16, we announced a new partnership with 1776, a global start-up incubator and seed fund that will open a campus in our rapidly growing innovation hub in Crystal City. The tech environment in Washington is focused on major global priorities: cyber, drones, energy, health, defense and more, all with growing mandates to innovate in new ways. Partnerships between start-ups, corporations and government are beginning to redefine the future of innovation in Crystal City. With our existing deep base of agencies, indigenous defense tech companies, and now a growing start-up community, we believe Crystal City is a natural environment for this kind of collaboration.","On the development front, we have a lot of action in Crystal City, Pentagon City, Rosslyn and Downtown. Currently in Crystal City, we are well along on the renovation of a 165,000 square foot building for WeWork's residential concept, which is scheduled to open later this year. In addition, we are actively exploring several invigorating concepts for exciting new retail, residential and other placemaking concepts that will change the face of Crystal City. We are particularly excited about the intersection of Crystal Drive and 18th Street, both for the repositioning of the building that the Marshals will be vacating at the Metro and for some significant retail that we are planning on that block. Our development pipeline in Crystal City alone is extensive, and we are carefully studying our next move.","In adjacent Pentagon City, our 699-unit apartment project to Bartlett and Whole Foods is on track for delivery about a year from now. We just poured the 12th floor and believe that, that building will not only be a premier residential property for us but an important connector between Crystal City and Pentagon City.","Downtown, early in 2016, we will be demolishing 2 older contiguous buildings where we will develop our new 335,000-square-foot corner trophy office building, 1700 M Street. The building will be located right off Connecticut Avenue in the heart of the Central Business District. We are hard at work in Washington, and look forward to harvesting our opportunity.","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Manny Korchman here with Michael. Steve, you're clearly advancing your Penn Plaza plans. You've hired Mark and Ed. You've shown what spend you've done there. You have an asset under contract for $355 million. Maybe you can give us some more details on when we should expect decisions to be made about the overall plan and when capital will be spent? And on that asset under contract, if you can give us any details as to how that fits into the plan or what type of building that is, That'll be helpful.","Steven Roth","We couldn't be more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us in the Penn Plaza District, where we have a vast holdings and an enormous position and where the marketplace is converging from the West, from the East and from the South. Having said all that, it's premature to -- we are building a team. We are involved in a very significant, I mean, very significant planning activity. We are in contact with all of the counterparties that you would expect us to be: governments, the railroads, all kinds of different things, neighbors. But it's premature. So the answer is that we have an enormous opportunity there. We are excited about it. We will disclose undoubtedly through government officials when our plans get to be precise, and it's premature now, and I apologize for that. I understand that you're looking for more information. I understand that our shareholders are excited about it, but I really can't go into any more detail than that. With respect to the asset that we have described in its dollar amount, we will disclose the details of that when we close it, which will be, I think, in the next quarter.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe just one follow-up to that, Steve. And I appreciate that you can't really speak publicly about what the plan is, but have you guys decided internally as to what that might look like and how you're planning to go through the approval process? Are you still at the stage where you're still sitting internally and discussing what that might look like?","Steven Roth","We're closer to having a plan internally than you think. We are very close to a plan. We've been in contact with counterparties, the government, et cetera.","Operator","The next question, Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steven Roth","Operator, hang on. I want to go back for a minute about Penn Plaza. I just want to say one more thing, okay. There are multiple facets of what we intend to do in Penn Plaza. There's lots of focus on the part of market participants in what we're going to do with the retail and the street level and the pedestrian areas, so that's all very, very important. But to me, the defining part of it is, is to take all of the office space that we own there and make that office space much more valuable by doing what we do to buildings. So we own a 2.5-million-foot building, a 1.5-million-foot building, a 1-million-foot building; improving those buildings for our office customer is really the main event. So I'm sorry, continue with the next question.","Operator","Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI is on the line with a question.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Steve, 2 questions. First, I just wanted to make sure I heard you correctly. You said that the rent at the St. Regis, I guess, would be up about 400% on a cash basis. If I recall correctly, that deal was about a 2% cash yield when you bought it. Can you just kind of confirm those numbers?","Steven Roth","If what you're going for, it's going to be 8% or 9%, that's not accurate.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Okay. I guess, that's what I was going for.","Steven Roth","So the answer is that's not accurate.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Do you care to clarify or give us a range?","Steven Roth","We have a pretty tight confi on that deal with this particular important tenant. I can only tell you that the market rents that we have achieved give us a -- are above what our underwriting was when we acquired the asset only 5 months ago and will give us a very satisfactory market rate of return. We're doing -- we did fine.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Okay. I guess on the 220 Central Park South, it sounds like you got that project off to a good start. Can you give us any -- I realize you won't disclose pricing on individual units, but could you give us an average sense of what the average selling price was on that 1.1 billion and kind of where did those units stack up within the building?","Steven Roth","The answer is, is I'm not going to disclose what our average price is for lots of different reasons, including competitive reasons. I will say, however, that there is no doubt that it is a record in Manhattan real estate. We are doing beyond well there. We are thrilled. What has been accomplished in 5 or 6 weeks has never been done before. And so we think we have the dominant project. So I hope that answers your question. What you said also is the sales are evenly arrayed from the top of the building to the bottom of the building. And they're also evenly arrayed in size of product.","Operator","Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill is on line with a question.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Good to see people out spending money in Central Park. So 2 questions here, Steve. Or actually, the first one is for Mitch. Can you just comment -- obviously, D.C., the occupancy has been improving. There have been some news articles about increased defense lobbying and obviously we can all read about the new bomber proposal you spoke about increased tech investing. So can you comment what you're seeing as far as increased defense, whether it's lobbying, contractors, et cetera, and If you're seeing that materialize as far as demand for office space or if this is just all news articles talking?","Mitchell N. Schear","Okay. So with respect to your specific question with respect to defense, not necessarily seeing anything in the context of defense lobbying, but what we are seeing is everything, as you said in the articles about possible increased spending through budgets. But what we're really seeing is some optimism through the contracting community. And as they're closely, closely monitoring what's happening within the government and within DoD, I think they're seeing that there's likely to be some increases within the budget year upcoming and in terms of what's in the proposed budget that's out there that's pending right now. In terms of whether that translates into them or the government leasing any additional space at this point in time, I think it's too early to make any of those conclusions.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then Steve, in your Chairman's letter, you reemphasized that everything is on the table, including separating out street retail in D.C. Just curious, obviously, D.C., hit a low point. Would seem inopportune to spin off and one can argue for a lot of synergies between street retail and New York. So curious from your perspective, is it just to emphasize to folks that you constantly are reviewing the business in the new and improved VNO? Or is it some sort of managerial decision that having these different elements really is too difficult to manage all under one umbrella, and they're likely better off ultimately as individual standalones.","Steven Roth","The answer to your question is yes, yes, and no. Clearly, we think about this every day in terms of how do we achieve the appropriate business model, and how do we achieve the appropriate values and shareholder values. With respect to management, we have no problem focusing on -- we've got the business to the point where we are extremely focused, extremely tightly managed, and we're very happy with that. So we have no trouble managing the street retail and the office buildings. We have no back -- trouble managing New York and Washington. So if we were to do something, it would not necessarily be because it would improve the -- our ability to manage these. It's all a matter of values and what is the right construct going forward. So people, there's been lots of swirling around, simplification is over, simplification is -- there's more things coming, all kinds of different rumors, and so I don't want to contribute to the rumors, but all I want to say is, we think about this every day; that is our job. And everything is possible, and there is a -- I'm not saying we're going to do something, I'm not saying we're not going to do something, and what I'm going to tell you is that we are doing our job; we're thinking about it.","Operator","Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch is online with a question.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess I want to focus on 555 California. You sold Santa Monica exiting some of your California assets. We've seen in the last week a little bit of a scare on sales force potentially being for sale. LinkedIn's number is not coming through quite as well as we they had expected. Any thoughts here on -- just on the San Francisco market in general? And when might be a good time to harvest that asset?","Steven Roth","We think San Francisco is just fine. We think it is -- while we have an obvious bias towards New York, we think San Francisco is a very, very strong market. We think that the Bank of America building, 555 California, is the best building in the marketplace. We have an incredible roster of conventional tenants, financial tenants and, now, tech tenants. I mean, Microsoft is not going anywhere. So we think the building is terrific. We think the financial performance of the building is improving. Having said all that, we are open for business.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then David, if you could just maybe talk through what you're seeing in terms of rent growth in New York City across the different submarkets? I know you had said the kind of higher-end boutique financial services are doing very well. But just generally, if you could give a little bit more color, that would be great.","David R. Greenbaum","So as you look across the basic submarkets, year-over-year, rent increases in Midtown were probably in the kind of 5%, 6% range. We did see rent increases in Midtown South continue in probably the low double digits. And the downtown marketplace with some of the significant absorption over the last year, you also saw low-double-digit rent increases. I think if you look forward now, I think where we may begin to see some of the largest rent increases, in fact, are Midtown. So as you look at Midtown today, off of the trough going back 7, 8 years, we've probably seen the lowest rent growth. Midtown South today is above where it was in 2007, 2008. Midtown still has a ways to go. And I think as it relates to our Penn Plaza assets, where obviously we've got a significant, significant 8-million-square-foot portfolio, and we effectively have, in a sense, our beat, and in a sense, own that marketplace. We have been aggressively pushing rents in Penn Plaza as you've seen in terms of what we've done at 330 West 34th Street and One Penn. So generally, I would tell you, I feel very good about where the marketplace is. We think we are going to start to see some significant rent increases. Listen, there's always space that comes back to the market. And as you look at the published numbers for the first quarter, we actually did see negative absorption in the first quarter, and it's several large blocks of space that were put back into the market, 28 Liberty, 1271 Sixth Avenue, 75 Rock, which was -- finally came into the statistics. This is a big marketplace, but generally, I feel very constructive in terms of where rents are going.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then how was -- how does the new space available downtown and at the Hudson Yards play into that? It sounds like you think rent is going to accelerated here actually even though that supply is actually coming online now.","David R. Greenbaum","It's a big marketplace, Jamie, and I will tell you, when we're adding 3 million, 5 million square feet onto the marketplace, the reality that's 1% of the stock of the city in a city that really has seen very little growth in its stock. In fact, virtually no growth in its stock over a 20-year period of time. So I don't see any significant impact from a couple of these buildings coming online.","Operator","Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs is on line with a question.","Bradley K. Burke - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask a question about what you're targeting for year end liquidity. Right now, you're at $1.1 billion. You closed on Springfield on March 31, I assume that the $340 million of cash is included in that balance. So even allowing for the refinancing at St. Regis, that still come up short of the $2 billion balance you had previously indicated. So and particularly if you close on the Penn Plaza acquisition, so I wanted to know whether we should expect additional refinancings or dispositions, or whether you might come in under that $2 billion balance?","Steven Roth","We're going to try to get very close to the $2 billion balance, and you can expect another refinancing or 2.","Bradley K. Burke - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then another one, just on your letter, you said that this might be a better time to harvest than invest so was hoping that you could give us a sense of the magnitude you might be considering for dispositions and just general comments on what types of assets you might be targeting.","Steven Roth","The answer -- the statement that I made was basically a general market outlook as opposed to something that would point to our specific plan within our company. We have done $5-odd billion of dispositions in offloading assets that we -- that don't fit our business model or that we no longer wanted. Now we're down to a very tight core of assets that we are very happy with. So we don't have any rotten apples so to speak. And if we sell anything, it would be because it would be an offensive move. So we don't have -- I don't think you can expect a very large disposition program from us right now. Notwithstanding my comments about the market, you will and you can expect us to be very careful about acquisitions because we do think that prices are high.","Operator","John Guinee with Stifel is on the line with a question.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great. First up, a macro question and then a micro question. This is Lexington Property Trust, LXP. A few years ago, this was a $12 stock, and it seemed pretty pricey, but I thought to myself, well, the guys at Vornado are on the board and they have a lot of good realtime information, so it must be going up because otherwise, they would sell. And now it's a $9.75 stock with very little investor interest. Can you give us some insight on your position at LXP, what you're thinking?","Steven Roth","I guess you're saying I was wrong.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","No, no, never I would say that. I was wrong, not you.","Steven Roth","LXP is a -- seems to be a bit of a value trap right now. If you look at all the metrics, the stock is very, very cheap compared to its industry group. It continues to get a little cheaper, so I can't predict stock prices. I can only tell you that we are not a long-term holder of LXP.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Got you. Okay. And then...","Steven Roth","By the way, the LXP has 2 other little nuances. Number one, it is part of our liquidity pool; it's very liquid. It is a high-dividend-paying stock, so we are earning, while we have a declining stock price, we are earning a dividend on that declining stock price. But -- and the second thing is, we have a very large tax gain in that position, which we have been trying to manage a little bit. So it's -- but it's certainly -- LXP is certainly on the for-sale list.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Do you have any good tax losses you can match shortly?","Steven Roth","We're trying.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then second, for Mitchell, just so we can help underwrite other companies we follow in the D.C. area. I'm doing a little bit of math on the U.S. Marshals lease, and obviously, at that time that was a must-do lease. Can you talk a little bit -- I'm going to just give you some numbers; you can fill in the blanks. It looks to me like TIs plus leasing commissions retending cost was about $130 a foot. How much of that would've been base building? How much is TIs? How much is leasing commission? Can you add in the free rent on that deal? And also add in the -- looks to me like about a $33.50 gross rent [ph] what the OpEx would be on that building? And then was it a full RFP process? Or how did the deal come about?","Mitchell N. Schear","Okay. So just to address your first question, this is a full government procurement process, so it went through with prospectus approval as well as through the various different stages. So we responded to the request for proposals that were issued by the government. And in their request for proposal, they basically say to all of the bidders, in order to comply and meet the minimum requirements of the proposal, you must provide a certain amount of allowances, which includes the basic tenant allowance as well as some security as well as what they refer to as a warm-lit shell. So those -- and with the leasing commission as well. So those numbers add up to the bulk of the expenses in terms of what we had to put into the deal, not a whole lot in terms of base building expenses. In terms of the OpEx on a building like that, you're probably looking at about $12 per square foot. And in terms of the free rent, I'm not going to comment on that.","Steven Roth","So John, let me pipe in on this because Mitchell had all of his partners involved in this decision and in this deal. So a couple of things. Number one, and I said in my brief remarks that this was a must-do retention. So this was a 350,000-square-foot-odd deal. So it's a 370,000-square-foot deal. We were very reluctant to spring another 370,000-square-foot hole number one. Number two, in the negotiations, the financial deal is rugged. There's no doubt about that, but we -- and if this was a freestanding deal, you might not have done it; you might have walked away from it. But the way we looked at it was that if we didn't do this deal, there was a likelihood based upon the current competitive position in the marketplace that, that space might be empty for 2, 3 years, who knows. Certainly not 1 year. So when you bogey the deal against having a rent-paying tenant in occupancy versus having an empty building for another number of years, the financial comparisons get to be tolerable. The last part of it is, and Mitchell has said this on this call and prior calls, we were able to orchestrate a musical chairs with this important client so that he -- they vacated a building right on top of the Metro, right at 18th Street, right at the entry to Crystal City, which we think is probably one of our best 1 or 2 buildings and is going to be a prime candidate for redevelopment. And we will do very well with that building that they're vacating, and they're moving down the block to a building which is in a lesser location, which could remain vacant for 2 or 3 or 4 years. So that's the logic of it. We understand the economics of the deal, and I'm just trying to give you just a little bit of color as to what our thinking was.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great. A follow-up, just one -- couple of quick add-ons. Refresh my memory, 1215 South Clark, what's the cross street there and what was the roughly year that building was built, floor plate size, et cetera? And then second, Mitchell, they ultimately took 370,000 square feet. Do you have any sense as to what their square footage was in the prior space, i.e., did -- was it an upsize or a downsize or a lateral -- equal move in size?","Mitchell N. Schear","Sure. So let me see if I got all of those follow-ons. I think you may have exceeded the 2 questions, but with respect to -- just to go back to your earlier point, your total package number that you quoted that you're sort of reverse-engineering was -- is too high of a number. It's lower than the number that you quoted. The building is basically at Crystal Drive and 12th Street and also intersects at South Clark. it's at the north end, and it's sort of one long block at that point away from the Bartlett in Pentagon City that we're building at 12th Street in terms of the orientation. The building is 1980s stock, and the building itself is about 3 -- the main building is about 350,000 square feet, so they spill over into more than just 1215 South Clark. And the floor plates are in the mid-20s per floor on a per-square-foot basis. And the final question, in terms of size, we talked about this on the last call, they currently lease 411,000 square feet. They will ultimately lease 371,000 square feet, so there is a bit of a reduction, although those leases for the balance between 371,000 and 411,000 square feet continue for another 3 to 5 years whether the government backfills that space or what remains to be seen. But we will continue to lease for at least another 3 or 4 years the full 411,000 square feet to the Marshals through the GSA.","Operator","John Bejjani with the Green Street Advisors is online with a question.","John Bejjani","Steve or David, for the couple developments you've announced last couple quarters in the Chelsea area, were the deals structured as JVs out of necessity? Or why not try to go solo for smaller projects like that?","Steven Roth","One was a JV, which we were invited into by a land owner, and we had no choice. And the second, we JV-ed with an adjacency -- an adjacent property owner. So in both cases, they were sort of JVs of necessity.","John Bejjani","Okay. And are you able to share a projected development cost on the West 22nd Street -- West 22nd project? And I guess, in general, should we expect to see you guys pursuing more ground-up development given where our current asset pricing is?","Steven Roth","The answer is we're not ready to share the development statistics currently. These are fairly new transactions. We will publish them at the appropriate time. The second thing is, is that our company historically, on a legacy basis for 34 years, has a massive development expertise in big projects and small projects. We did multibillion-dollar Bloomberg Tower. We're doing the multibillion-dollar 220 and more and more and more. We have that expertise in Washington. We have it locally. We also have redevelopment capability where we take an office building and totally renovate the front of the house, the back of the house, the systems and what have you. So it's a skill set that we have and we use as the -- as we are able to find appropriate opportunities and as the markets turn. So we actually like development. We prefer to buy somebody else's building at $0.80 on the dollar at the right part of the cycle or $0.70 on the dollar. But we do have the development skills, and we do partake of then and we think be the appropriate time.","Operator","Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley is on line with a question.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe for David, if we could focus on Midtown South for a moment, could you comment on whether the TAMI strength is bringing others that need to be close to those types of tenants to the neighborhood and perhaps having a multiplicative effect when you think about the venture capitalists and lawyers and others that might want to be in the vicinity? Are you seeing any benefit there?","David R. Greenbaum","Remember, TAMI is a broad kind of category that includes technology, advertising, information, media. So we are seeing those tenants migrating effectively to areas that you're referring to Midtown South. Have we seen a significant migration there of some of the other service professionals that may be working with some of the TAMI tenants, lawyers, et cetera. I would tell you, we -- I don't think the answer to that is yes. I mean, we have not really seen that. In terms of the financial service guys, the venture capital guys, as you look at the sites that we are redeveloping right now, as you look at what we are doing over at 85 10th and there's another deal that we're working on basically in that kind of Westside market. The finance guys, while we think of them in the traditional, as I referred to it this morning, fire tenancy, the reality is they love these kind of locations just like the TAMI guys do.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just sticking with Midtown South, something we've been hearing about is the higher property assessments and resulting higher taxes for buildings that are just much more valuable today than in years past. Do you have any thoughts on the higher property taxes making their way into rents over time and perhaps taking some of the appeal out of Midtown South if this narrows the gap at all with rental rates elsewhere? Or is that just not an issue?","David R. Greenbaum","One thing that seems to be a truism is that real estate taxes go up over time. Real estate taxes historically, there was a wide gap kind of in taxes as it related to Midtown South and what I call traditional Midtown. These increases in taxes get phased in based off of an income and expense methodology over a 5-year period of time. So as the rents have gone up in Midtown South, the question is, Vance, are we going to continue to see a narrowing of the gap of the real estate taxes which will be passed through to the tenants in Midtown South and Midtown, I think the answer to that is yes.","Steven Roth","But, Vance, what's happening is, is Tom Friedman wrote a book, said the world is flat, well, David is going to write a book that says Manhattan is flat. So it's not just the real estate taxes that are starting to rise. It's the rents have risen, so that if you look at the various submarkets, whether they be Midtown or Downtown or center of town, whether they be north, or whether they be on the west side or center of the island, rents are converging as are asset prices. So you can spend over $1,000-a-foot for a building that's in Chelsea right now, but that was unheard of. And so the point I'm trying to make is, is that the island is flattening, rents, asset values, tenancies are all now getting to be very similar across the entire -- each submarket of the island.","Operator","Ross Nussbaum with UBS is online with a question.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Steve, on 220 Central Park South, would you at this point take the over -- if I just simply took the $1.1 billion that you roughly said you sold 1\/3 of the building, multiply it by 3, what's your confidence level at this point that you're going to end up with greater than $3.3 billion of total sales there?","Steven Roth","Ross, I really don't want to speculate. We're going to do -- we're thrilled with it. We're delivering the best product that's ever been delivered into the Manhattan residential market. So we're very confident in the quality of the product, the design. We're very confident in the location, and we're going to do very well with it. We're going to get a fair price for a fair product, but I don't want to speculate as to where we're going to end up.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. My thought to corporate governance topic, and I guess the question is -- and you've talked about this a little in the past, which is you've got a staggered board, and I think in the past, you've acknowledged that it may not be ideal but wasn't necessarily changing anytime soon. But beyond that, I sort of look at the composition and say you've got 4 board members over the age of 75. You've got 3 of them who've been on the board for more than 30 years. I guess the question is with the \"increased level of activism\" that's been going around in the REIT sector in the last year, does it cause you to rethink the structure and\/or composition of your board as you go forward?","Steven Roth","Probably. [ph] Take out Warren Buffett's annual report and give it a quick read. I think his board is older and more seasoned than mine by a long shot, although we can't -- anyway, so the long and the short of it is, is our board is extraordinarily competent. They are senior. They have been involved in the management operations and development of the company for a -- for a long time. And the answer to that is, is our board thinks that they are very confident and qualified in doing a great job as do I. Now we believe in youth. We believe in change. We also believe in continuity. And so every once in a while, we recruit and attract a new board member, and if you look at the proxy -- I don't want single anybody out, but we have added over the last years an extraordinary individual, another one and another one, and we're going to continue to do that. So I know some of the folks that the activists have been putting on some of these boards. And I can tell you that the individuals that are on our board are not more competent, much more competent. So there you have it.","Operator","Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank is on line with a question.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just want to have a question on the balance sheet here. You mentioned the floating rate debt going up to 23%. I think it was about 17% last quarter. And you've got RiverHouse coming on in the next quarter here. And just [ph] how high you're willing to let that go up to or if there's plans to maybe reverse that percentage over the next couple quarters.","Steven Roth","That's a very difficult question. It's a very sophisticated question. We have no bogey with respect to the ratio and the mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt. Generally speaking, we look at each asset -- well we -- as you know, when I wrote about it in the shareholders letter this year, we have more project-level nonrecourse debt than we do have unsecured guaranteed debt. So that's number one in terms of the mix of debt. Number two is, is that if an asset is mature with long-term leasing and stabilized income, it's -- that's a candidate for fixed-rate debt. If an asset is on the for-sale list or if it's in a development prestabilization stage, or if we think the income is going to change and then it's more of a candidate for shorter-term floating rate debt where we can prepay it. There is 2 -- our decisions are based upon 2 or 3 things. One is our view on where interest rates are going, which is a very, very risky thing to start predicting the interest rate market. Number two is, the status of the asset and what is a better capital structure for the individual asset. And the third is, is that I will tell you that, call me crazy, but if you look at a 25-year cycle, the price of shorter-term floating rate debt has been vastly more favorable to fixed-rate debt in almost every year of the entire 25-year cycle. So having said all that, we do it asset by asset. We have no bogey. We do understand that fixed-rate; debt is something that is you can model as opposed to floating rate debt, which fluctuates. And there's one other thing. Floating rate debt has the advantage that you can pay it off with generally at par with no penalties or almost a very small penalty. Fixed-rate debt, which has defeasance, and I think defeasance goes to a treasury -- a short-term rate is very, very, very expensive to pay off. So when you take fixed-rate debt, you have to be pretty much resigned that, that debt is going to last on that asset to maturity. So those are some of the things that go into our decisions, and we think that a capital structure which has 1\/4 floating and 3\/4 fixed is absolutely an appropriate -- certainly not an out-of-line capital structure.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then another question just...","Steven Roth","Hang on, by the way, let me just add a couple of more things to that. We and many of the blue chips in our industry have very, very low rates of debt. So we have a debt ratio which is somewhere in the low 30s of percent of the values of our assets. So in terms of a risk point of view and what have you, the better companies in our industry, us and ourselves included, have very low levels of debt. So that's also something that's very much in our mind as we -- and we will continue that way -- as we continue -- as we manage our balance sheet.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just another question moving back to street retail. Last quarter, you talked about there was a question about tourism and if there's an impact on street retail, and you had mentioned hotel bookings. As a little bit of an early warning sign, just wondering if you could update us on what you're seeing from -- as it relates to tourism's impact on street retail?","Steven Roth","Yes, sure. I mean, just anecdotally, the hotels are getting a little bit impacted by the strength of the dollar. Obviously, retail will be impacted by -- we don't see a lot of that. What we do see is that asset prices have gotten extraordinarily high and, therefore, rents that owners are asking the retailers to pay is -- are also very high. So the single thing -- the biggest thing that's affecting the street retail business is the high rents, which I think has a much larger effect than the fluctuations in the dollar.","Operator","Derek Van Dijkum with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse is on the line with a question.","Derek Van Dijkum","I was wondering if you could just give some more color on pricing for fully marked-up street retail leases.","Steven Roth","Can you put some bones on that question for me, Derek?","Derek Van Dijkum","Well, you've been borrowing street retail at, call it, sub-3 caps. And now, for example, the St. Regis property. Now that you've fully marked up the rents at that property, what do you think market pricing for an asset like that should be?","Steven Roth","Let me see. I think what you're saying is if you have a fully stabilized retail asset, which has a lease which is at market as opposed to below market, what would the cap rate be?","Derek Van Dijkum","Correct.","Steven Roth","Okay. Well, the answer to that is it depends upon the submarket in New York, and it depends upon the quality of the asset. So if it's a so-so asset on Second Avenue or something like that, I don't know. But if it's a first-class asset in prime Fifth Avenue or prime Times Square or whatever, I think it's going to be probably sub-4. Now you have to remember, the street retail business, these assets are the scarcest asset in all of real estate. There's -- our street retail is a very, very -- there is a very limited supply of this merchandise.","Operator","Michael Bilerman with Citi is on the line with a question.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Steve, I just had 2 quick follow-ups on cap structure. In your shareholder's letter, you talked about unsecured debt and secured debt, and I'm just curious your view today. Is there anything -- you only have 2 issuances left. Is there anything in that unsecured covenant package that you don't like? And then as you think about -- you made a comment in the letter about taking leverage up on the secured -- in assets up to 60% and effectively unencumbering a bunch of others. Do you think you're going to do that by leveraging up assets? Or by issuing unsecured debt to pay down secured debt?","Steven Roth","We're not going to do it either way. So first of all, Vornado is an investment-grade company. We covet our investment grade. We live by the covenants in our debt instruments. We -- as you said, we don't like any of them. The answer is, is we have huge tolerances to any of them, so they really don't influence the management of our business at all. Said again, we're investment grade. We're going to just stay investment grade. We love our covenants. We honored our covenants, and we have enormous tolerance to each of our covenants, which means we have lots of capacity. Michael, your second question was -- I put a couple of paragraphs in my letter this year to give a sum of how I think about debt. And the point of it is, is that -- and the point I was making was that we have -- I think it was $8 billion or something like that of project-level secured nonrecourse debt against $20 billion of assets at market. So that ratio was kind of out of kilter is what I was -- point I was making. So we had -- the secured debt is at 40% of those assets that secure the debt, whereas a normalized ratio might be 60%. So therefore, if we wanted to, we could do 1 of 2 things. We could take the assets down from $20 million to $16 million and unencumber $4 billion of assets, or we could take the debt level up higher. We have no current intention of doing either of them. That was just a little bit of arithmetic to give you and your colleagues some idea of how we think.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. I didn't know if you're going to make -- be a little bit more aggressive overall on the balance sheet to make that happen, or if there was something on the unsecured side that...","Steven Roth","We have no current intention of being aggressive in our balance sheet. And we have a current intention of being extremely conservative, being cash heavy, being debt light as we always have been.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then my second question -- just sticking with capital structure and thinking about the stock. You've been reluctant to do a share-repurchase program in the more recent history of Vornado. Obviously, you're very active a number of decades ago. I guess, how would you think about using some of your firepower to buy back the stock at these levels? And if you weren't going to do that, should we expect more strategic type of moves like you've been doing to narrow that discount relative to your perception of where NAV is?","Steven Roth","Michael, I hate our stock price. I hate it. So that's step one. And I take it personally. Step two is what we're going to do about it. Well, over the last 2-some-odd years, we've done a lot about it. And some of the things that I put in our letter this year was to suddenly indicate that we intend to continue to do and manage the company, manage our strategy, manage our business, manage our balance sheet to enhance values and realize the values that we think our business is worth. So I hate our stock price. I think it's -- I just, I hate it. That's enough. And without being specific, there are tools that we have to begin to -- whether it's spinning this or buying that or doing -- but we have nothing specific to announce now. And I think -- I did put a section in the letter this year about the history of buybacks and the history of issuing stock, and we have a history of buying stock back when it's much cheaper. So I don't have anything to say about buybacks, and I have nothing to say about spins. All I have to say is I hate our stock price.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Steven Roth","Thank you, all, very much. I would make one observation, and that is we learn as much from these calls and your questions and the interaction with you, all, than I think you do with us. So we value the interaction, and we'll see you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Also in the room are Michael Franco, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer; Mark Hudspeth, Executive Vice President and Head of Capital Markets; and Matt Iocco, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone.","Well, volatility seems to be back in a big way taking stocks down meaningfully, especially at our space. I've been saying for the past couple of years that the easy money has been made for this cycle, asset prices are high, it's a better time to sell, than it is to buy, and most importantly, now is the time in the cycle and this books stock when the smart guys build cash.","We did build cash, and we did sell assets, and we did give birth to two new important and focused company's through spin-off. We pushed away from acquisitions at [top-tech] prices. We have identified another billion dollars of assets to be sold, and cash will further increase meaningfully from 220 Central Park South closings beginning in 2019. We are in great shape for whatever is the come, whether it'd be defense or opportunity.","Our office business is performing well, while retail continues to be soft and accordingly we expect 2018 to be a flattish year. Here are a few operational highlights for the fourth quarter. David will of course do a complete review in a moment.","We are full. New York office occupancy was 97.1% up 10 basis points from the third quarter. We're also full at the theMART and we are working on a lease at the Q, which will bring us the full at 555 California Street at San Francisco.","New York average starting rents were at near record $76 per square foot for the fourth quarter, and they were a record $79 per square foot for the year. New York office mark-to-market was 7.3% GAAP, and 6.9% cash on 319,000 square feet of leasing for the quarter.","Cycles are a way of life and right now the market seems to be down on New York. I can tell you we don't see it. Demand for office space in New York continues to be robust coming from all manner of users in all sub markets. The hottest submarkets in town runs from Hudson Yards to Penn Plaza and extent south through Chelsea and Meatpacking. For those who say there is no rent growth in New York, I suggest you take a very close look at these submarkets and Fifth Avenue will always be Fifth Avenue.","New York is the financial capital in the world and the media capital, and the marketing and advertising capital, and the legal and accounting capital, you get the message. And New York has the second highest concentration of tech employees only to Silicon Valley. As the new supply, we believe job growth will be sufficient to absorb it.","I would comment that Google's purchase of the 1.2 million square foot Chelsea market announced last week which brings their ownership to over 4 million square feet in New York further validates New York as a talent center and further reinforces the importance of the Westside. All great companies must have a major presence in New York. And I can't help but mention that we own two buildings right across the street from Google.","Last week and to be recorded in our first quarter 2018 office leasing activity, we completed an important lease with Facebook at 770 Broadway where additional 78,000 square feet the entire third floor. That brings them to a total of 513,000 square feet in the building.","What made this deal unique is that we bought back the floor from Kmart who had 18 years remaining on their lease at $33.50 per square foot. This is the first deal we've done with Kmart and Kmart still has 82,000 square feet at 770 Broadway and 141,000 square feet at One Penn Plaza at the same low rents.","Now to recap. In the fourth quarter retail occupancy was 96.9% up 120 basis points from last quarter. Retail mark-to-markets were 66.6% GAAP, and 54.6% cash on a total of 39,000 square feet of leasing. With all due respect the GAAP accounting, assets are valued, bought and sold on cash numbers and we run the business on cash numbers.","Fourth quarter total cash basis NOI was $342.3 million up 7.4% from the fourth quarter of 2016. New York segment cash basis same-store NOI was up 7.0%. theMart cash basis same-store NOI was up 13.7% and 555 California Street cash basis same-store NOI was up 32.4%. As Joe will discuss in a few minutes, we reaffirm the guidance I first provided in my April 2017 annual letter to shareholders that retail cash basis NOI will not go below 309 million.","As is our custom, we publish management's estimate of NAV once a year in the fourth quarter supplement. Please we see Page 10. Adjusting for a $23 reduction from our July 2017 spin-off of Washington, our updated spot NAV is 96 per share, down from $112 per share a year ago.","The primary reasons for this; first, we are no longer capitalizing the incremental NOI from signed leases not yet commenced. This resulted in a $6 reduction. So all the substantial amount of cash and GAAP incremental NOI from signed leases has not changed, we do not think it's appropriate to add the pluses without recognizing the minuses.","Second, a $5 reduction resulting from increasing the cap rate on Street retail 50 basis points from 3.75% from [2.75% from 3.75%] which we believe more accurately reflects current market conditions.","And third, a $5 reduction resulting primarily from recognizing and capitalizing market management expense, adjusting 220 Central Park South value for dividends paid, and marking to market Alexander's, Urban Edge and PREIT stock prices.","On January 17, 2018 we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.63 per share at an annual rate of $2.52, a 7.7% increase. Please note this is RemainCo's dividend adjusted for the Washington spit. In the last two years we have raised our dividend three times by 29%. Based on yesterday's closing price, the dividend yield is 3.7%.","Now turning to the investment sales market. Office investment sales activity slowed meaningfully in 2017 bidding pools are thin or about average price per pound, and average cap rate had held up well. Pricing for the few AI assets that have come to market was strong and demand and pricing for assets South and West in Manhattan is very strong and record-setting consistent with tenant demand. Overall, buyers remained discipline giving where we are at the cycle.","In the retail sector, there continues to be little sales activity due to the lack of quality product towards the market and investor skittishness and maybe those should be in reverse order.","Debt markets for New York remains solid - remain as liquid and strong as we had seen with all markets wide open. In the face of rising rates, spreads have continued to tighten keeping all in coupons attractive. To sum up that, I\u2019m very pleased with both our operating performance and our financial performance.","Before I turn it over to David, I want to clear something up. Two weeks ago, a couple of media outlets speculated incorrectly that I might be opposed to the Gateway Tunnel project based on the two [sent emails] that I sent to Transportation Secretary, Elaine Chao back in order. So I just want to state the following for the record.","Like everyone I know in the business in civic communities of New York and New Jersey, I believe that Gateway is far and away the most important infrastructure project at our region and one of the most critical for our nation. I'm also confident that the federal government and both states political leaders will devise an equitable core sharing agreement to get this project built, which undoubtedly will involve substantial federal participation.","David?","David Greenbaum","Steve, thank you, and good morning to all. I will begin as I usually do with my thoughts on the New York real estate market over the past 12 months.","2017 was a breakthrough year for the financial services sector. Employment grew by 13,000 jobs, a largest annual increase in over a decade. As a result, financial services employment ended the year at 11 last seen back in 2000.","Importantly, much of this growth took place prior to the passage and the recent tax bill and with deregulation still work in progress, and we believe we are in the early innings of significant growth in the financial services sector employment.","If you look at the recent announcements, Bank of America reached the entirety of 1100 Avenue of the Americas and MasterCard took all of 150 Fifth Avenue. And there are now reports of JPMorgan Chase's potential expansion by 400,000 square feet at 390 Madison Avenue after committing earlier last year to 430,000 square feet at Five Manhattan West.","Much of the growth in financial services employment is attributable not to traditional banking and insurance roles but rather the so-called fintech. This convergence of tech and non-tech is why I do not put much stock in reported decrease of 9,000 TAMI jobs in 2017.","I noted last quarter that the state controller estimates that nearly 50% of technology jobs in New York City are found in traditional sectors from retail to healthcare and from insurance to banking. We believe that tech remains strong and reported decline in TAMI employment is offset in a significant way by tech jobs in traditional sectors.","Overall for the year, office using employment grew by 20,000 jobs in 2017 and is now up by 173,000 jobs in the last five years. With this continuing strong employment numbers, our market experienced strong leasing velocity over the past 12 months.","Total Manhattan office leasing reached almost 40 million square feet in 2017, the highest level in 15 years. The story of 2017 was also the important large leases for an all time high of 22 deals greater than 250,000 square feet. In addition, there were 27 new relocation leases larger than 100,000 square feet more than 40% of which were in the Penn Plaza West side submarket.","Tenant and in particular large tenants continue to demonstrate a preference for new product and for high quality redevelopment. Class A product captured more than 68% of the total leasing volume largest share since 1995.","With the continuing strong job growth, our markets should be able to absorb the new office supply coming online and that is particularly true where as we, as many observers believe the trend toward the intensification is slowing as employees continue to invest in larger amenitized shared spaces to foster collaboration and employee retention.","Overall Manhattan vacancy at year-end 2017 was 8.9%, an improvement of 40 basis points over the prior year. Our overall Manhattan asking rents generally were flat as the island of Manhattan continues to tilt to South and to the West. We have seen significant rent growth in the new growing neighborhood with rents in West Chelsea now well above rents on Park Avenue.","With the backdrop of a robust market, let me now turn to Vornado's performance over the past year. In 2017 we leased nearly 1.9 million square of office space in our 139 separate transactions across our New York office portfolio. We achieved a high watermark average starting rent of $79 per square foot with strong mark-to-market of 12.8% GAAP and 9.9% cash.","Almost 30% of our 1.9 million square feet of 2017 leasing activity represented real growth by tenants in New York both tenants expanding, as well as tenants moving into the city for the first time. This included names such as Bertelsmann, HomeAdvisor IAC, Facebook, Google, Glencore, United Talent Agency, Guggenheim Partners and Cushman & Wakefield.","Financial services and fire tenants represented the largest share of our 2017 leasing activity, about 45% in total. Behind that number is an extraordinary diversity of companies and industries from banks to hedge funds and from insurers to private equity investors including Wells Fargo, Lone Star, Hudson Advisors, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, Principal Global Investors and Whitebox Advisors.","TAMI tenants represented the second largest share of our activity at about 27% with tenants including EMC, automotiveMastermind and Google. And just last week as Steve mentioned, Facebook expanded yet again at 770 Broadway this time leasing the entire 78,000 square foot third floor previously leased by Kmart.","We had another strong year in our trophy assets as team completed 17 deals in seven of our buildings at or above $100 a foot more than any other owner. These 17 leases with an average starting rent of $117 per foot totaled 363,000 square feet, 20% of our total activity. It's worth noting that whereas market wise, substantially all of the trophy leasing activity took place in newbuildings, all of our transaction other than 61 Ninth were in our redeveloped assets, 90 Park, 280 Park, 350 Park, 650 Madison, 770 Broadway and our headquarters at 888 Seventh Avenue.","We have proven our ability to reposition existing buildings to compete with the best new construction. At One Penn during 2017, we leased 340,000 square feet across 39 separate transactions including a new headquarters lease with Siemens Mobility for 34,000 square feet.","The average starting rent at One Penn was nearly $69 a foot, the highest average ever achieved and that is before we kickoff a major redevelopment later this year with a new double high class lobby upgrades to storefronts and public plazas, the addition of social and amenity spaces on the first and second floors, new destination dispatch elevators, and a new entrance in the Penn Station. Our goal is to transform the building which will now be rebranded as Penn One as we have the rest of our fleet and to generate commensurate top-level rents.","We remain focused on the 4. 2 million square foot One and Two Penn duo and the surrounding district. The public sector also is focused on the Penn Plaza neighborhood, as I mentioned last quarter the district was front and center in the city's proposal to Amazon. Governor Cuomo has reiterated his intention to transform Penn Station that sits at his heart, as senior team continues to engage actively with our partners and government.","Let me now turn briefly to the fourth quarter which as I stated in our last call will be relatively quiet given that we had little large vacancy and only modest rollover. During the quarter we executed 34 leases totaling 319,000 square feet with average starting rents of $76 a foot and positive mark-to-markets was 7.3% GAAP and 6.9% cash. Our year-end occupancies stood at 97.1% up 80 basis points over the past year.","Same-store growth during the fourth quarter was a robust 4.6% on a GAAP basis and an excellent 8.9% cash, which caps the year in which our office same-store numbers for 2017 were up 3.7% GAAP and even better 11.5% cash.","Over the past five years since the starting 2013, mark-to-markets and our office portfolio have averaged 17.9% GAAP and 12.8% cash. We have industry-leading levels as is our same-store performance of the same period. Since 2013, we have average same-store growth of 4.7% GAAP and 7.6% cash.","Our leasing team has been active in the first quarter of 2018 with more than 40,000 square feet of leases either signed year-to-date or in negotiation and an additional 900,000 square feet in the pipeline including a sizable number of new and expansion deals.","Now let me spend a minute updating you about our development and redevelopment efforts which will drive future leasing. At 61 Ninth Avenue and the red-hot Meatpacking district, last October Starbucks commenced the buildout of the East Coast first reserve roastery and tasting room, a giant 20,000 square foot experiential retail space.","In the second quarter of this year, we will deliver the remainder of the building at 145,000 square feet to Aetna which looks like it has changed its plan in the wake of its pending $68 billion merger with CVS. Our 13-year lease is a fully binding obligation and it is our understanding that Aetna currently intends to sublease the space.","Also in the second quarter and just a few blocks north, we will complete another ground-up best-in-class boutique office building at 512 West 22nd Street directly on the highline. With the building nearing completion, tenant interest has increased dramatically. 512 West 22 is a building we have always expected will be a multitenant building. In fact, as we had expected at 61 Ninth prior to Aetna coming along where tenants will need to see the completed building to a fully appreciated unique spaces with outdoor terraces on each floor. Our full leasing effort will begin this spring.","In the third quarter, we will complete 606 Broadway in heart of Soho. And next up for our growing roster of boutique properties will be 260 11th Avenue where we are on track to complete the landmark process in the first half of this year so that we can begin the Richard Rogers design transformation of the historic Otis Elevator Building.","To augment the redevelopment, just last week we acquired 537 West 26 Street, the contiguous property to the East of 260 11th Avenue, a grand historic building with large column free spaces and roofs peaking at 29 feet.","Last but certainly not least, the redevelopment of the Boulevard Farley Building is well underway, as Penn Station's construction of the new Moynihan Train Hall is on schedule. The existing skylights in the building have been demolished with new skylights steel deliveries beginning this month. The future Train Hall construction is moving swiftly and the 850,000 square feet of office and retail space is not far behind with delivery on track for the second half of 2020.","And remember, all of this development activity plus our repositioning of One Penn is taking place in the neighborhood, employers and employees prefer and where rents are growing the fastest.","Turning now to our retail portfolio, let me say a few words about the market. Our e-commerce penetration continues to grow in New York as in every city, in New York we are the beneficiary of 62 million annual tourists. As they shop here, they are increasingly encountering successful brick-and-mortar outlets of leading online brands such as Amazon, Warby Parker and Bonobos. In the wake of these strong early experiments this multichannel approach is likely to grow.","As tenants continue to test the market before making long-term commitments, short-term deals and pop-up opportunities are becoming more prevalent. In November, we launched the very successful SJP's shoe store with Sarah Jessica Parker at our 640 Fifth Avenue on 52nd Street. With strong early performance before Christmas, we are working to refresh the store for another launch and another run of this store this spring.","In a challenging retail leasing environment, we continue to see a slight to the highest quality submarkets of markets that we are in Times Square Upper Fifth Avenue. In 2017, our retail team leased 126,000 square feet across 17 transactions with strong mark-to-markets of 26.5% GAAP and 25.4% cash. This included leases with creditworthy tenants such as Amazon, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, Fidelity Investments, Levi's and Sephora. Our retail occupancy ended the year at 96.9%.","1535 Broadway in the very heart of Times Square exemplifies the strength of our portfolio. If you watch the ball drop on New Year's Eve we saw the dominating presence of our 4K LED screen, the world's largest. Retailers also have recognized the unique visibility of this block fund and later this year we will welcome the new flagship stores from both Sephora and Levi's to this property which is now fully leased with a top-notch roster that also includes T-Mobile and Swatch Group USA.","Over on Fifth Avenue at the end of last year Dyson opened a spectacular new emporium at 640 Fifth Avenue and at 731 Lexington in the former workspace, we will introduce the first U.S. restaurant of the award-winning Hutong from the U.K.-based Aqua Restaurant Group.","That lease is one of four fourth-quarter transactions totaling 39,000 square feet as mark-to-markets of 66.6% GAAP and 54.6% cash. For the quarter, our retail same-store performance was flattish at a negative 1.4% GAAP and a positive 3.2% cash. For the year, retail same-store numbers were again a flattish negative 0.3% GAAP and a strong positive 11.3% cash.","I\u2019m now going to turn to theMART. In 2017 at theMART we signed 71 leases for a total of 345,000 square feet, an average starting rent of 4760 with positive mark-to-markets of 26% GAAP and 16.6% cash. Last quarter I mentioned that we were in the process of taking back an additional 40,000 square feet of showroom space on the ninth floor to create more best-in-class office space. We have now signed an LOI for all of the space with an existing tenant at theMART and are now on lease documentation.","This summer, Publicis, a tenant on the fourth and fifth floors will vacate its 132,000 square feet and when it's lease expires in July. This represents an opportunity for us with the Publicis lease well below the current market for this iconic asset.","Our same-store growth at theMART for the fourth quarter was 7.1% GAAP and 13.7% cash and for the full year was 4.2% GAAP and 7.6% cash. Looking back over the last five years, since 2013 our mark-to-markets at theMART by 22.5% GAAP and 14.4% cash and during that five-year period of time we averaged a remarkable annual 8.8% on a same-store GAAP basis positive and a 9.1% cash staggering numbers.","In San Francisco our 1.8 million square foot 3-building complex includes the iconic 555 California Street Tower, as well as the historic building at 315 Montgomery and the former Bank of America Banking Hall at 345 Montgomery.","Let me first spend a moment on what we've accomplished at 315 Montgomery Street, where BofA originally leased the entire 235,000 square foot building at fully escalated rents of $43 a foot. We embark on a lobby redesigned to update the building and appeal to TAMI tenants. The redesigned preserve the building's historic features for installing modern elements such as a glass entry portal, exterior lighting programming, and destination dispatch elevators with new cabs.","We completed the project in July of last year. Fast-forward today with a lease we just signed last week, and a second lease that is out for signature, the entire building will have been fully released at an average starting rent of $63, an increase is nearly 50% on a cash basis.","Next up is 345 Montgomery, and one of San Francisco's most iconic corners where we have secured government approval to kickoff the redevelopment of what we call the cube. SOM has designed creative office space with a large atrium that will offer a tenant a distinct branding opportunity in the center of San Francisco's Financial District. We have signed a letter of intent for a net lease of the entire 64,000 square foot building.","The highlights of our fourth quarter in San Francisco is a 30,000 square foot expansion in renewal with Kirkland Ellis bringing their total tendency to 150,000 square feet while extending the lease to 2030. For the fourth quarter in San Francisco, our mark-to-markets were positive 26.7% GAAP and 11.5% cash.","For the year in San Francisco, we signed 10 office leases for a total of 285,000 square feet at an average starting rent north of $88 per foot at strong mark-to-markets of 24.2% GAAP and 11.1% cash. In total across all of our retail and office properties in New York, Chicago and San Francisco for the year in 2017 we leased over 2.6 million square feet at a blended average starting rent of $86.90 across all asset classes and had positive mark-to-markets of 13% GAAP and 9.8% cash.","We remain proud of our industry leading numbers and as I've said before these numbers were credit both to the quality of our portfolio and to the hard work of our enormously talented professionals.","Joe?","Joseph Macnow","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone.","Fourth quarter total FFO was $0.80 per share compared to $4.20 in the prior year's fourth quarter. Please see our earnings release Form 10-K or our financial supplement for details of the items that affect comparability.","Fourth quarter FFO was adjusted for comparability with $0.98 per share compared to a $1.2 in the prior year's fourth quarter, a decline of $0.04 or $5.7 million primarily due to the following. First, as previously disclosed in December of 2016, we received $192 million a repayment of our created mezzanine loans on 85 Tenth Avenue, and also received a 49.9% equity interest in the property for $1. Fourth quarter FFO from our 49.9% equity interest was $6.4 million less than the FFO in 2016s fourth quarter from the mezzanine loan.","Second, a $5.8 million increase in interest expense inclusive of our share partially owned entities comprised of $3.1 million from $356 million of higher average debt balances, $2.1 million from higher floating-rates, $2.5 million of additional rent expense of 1535 Broadway which is treated as interest on the capital lease accounting, partially offset by $900,000 of interest savings from a lower average rate on our fixed rate debt.","Third, due to a change in New York state's tax TRS filing methodology which was permitted combined tax returns from the TRS, that resulted in refunds of taxes previously expense and in 2016 therefore reduced 2016 tax expense by $5.5 million which of course do not reoccur into 2017.","Partially offsetting this was $10.9 million of higher same store net operating income as a result of strong performance which I will discuss next and $1.1 million increase in non-same store income primarily from a straight-line write-off in 2016 fourth quarter.","New York's fourth quarter same-store NOI increased by $8.2 million or 2.8% on the GAAP basis, an increase by $18.2 million or 7% on the cash basis. theMART in 555 California Street produced a weighted average same-store NOI increase of 8.1% on a GAAP basis and increased by 19.4% on a cash basis.","Now to our results for the full year. FFO's adjusted for the year was $3.73 per share compared to $3.59 per share for 2016, an increase of $0.14 or a strong 3.9%. On a cash basis, 2017 FFO was adjusted was $3.39 per share compared to $3.06 per share for 2016, an increase of $0.33 or a very strong 10.8%.","New York's full year 2017 same store NOI increased by $29.5 million or 2.7% on a GAAP basis an increase by an extraordinary $108.2 million or 11.3% on a cash basis. Our other segment produced the same-store NOI increase of $5.1 million or 3.5% on a GAAP, an increase by $19.1 million or 15.2% on a cash basis.","Now let me spend a minute focusing on 2018. We expect retail 2018 cash NOI to be at the low end of the guidance that Steve mentioned, close to $309 million due to the following. A $9 million reduction in rent from H&M at 435 Seventh Avenue where we extended on a temporary basis, a $16 million reduction from other retail tenant expires in 2018, none of which are in the Upper Fifth Avenue or Times Square properties partially offset by 8 million of contractual rent step ups, and 7 million from new leases commencing in 2018 or full year in 2018 versus a partial year in 2017 including Dyson at 640 Fifth Avenue which commences September 2017 and the Starbucks Roastery at 61 Ninth Avenue which will commence in June 2018.","For the purposes of what I just given you, it's a worst-case scenario and we don't assume any new leasing and a retail portfolio. We are projecting 2018 interest expense including our share of partially owned entities to be approximately $16 million or $0.08 per share higher than in 2017 primarily due to a $15 million increase from estimated higher average floating-rate. As a result of these items, we expect 2018 NOI and therefore FFO on a comparable basis to be flattish.","Now to capital markets activity. We were very active in the fourth quarter. On October 17, we extended one of our two $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities from November 2018 to January 2022 with two six-month extension options. This was over subscribe and very well executed.","Interest rate on the extended facility was lowered from LIBOR plus 105 to LIBOR plus 100. The interest rate and facility fees are now the same as our other $1.25 billion revolving credit facility which matures in February 2021 with two six-month extension options.","On December 27, 2017 we redeemed our $450 million, 2.5% senior unsecured notes due 2019. We refinanced these notes with 450 million of seven-year 3.5% senior unsecured notes with January 15, 2025. The notes were sold at 99.596% of the face amount to produce a yield of 3.565%. In connection therewith, we expensed $4.8 million of debt prepayment costs and unamortized deferred financing cost from the debt we retired which is treated as a non-comparable item.","Also in December 2017, we called through redemption our 200 million 6 and 5 days percent Series G preferred shares and our 270 million, 6 and 5 [days percent] Series I preferred shares, a total of 470 million. We funded these redemptions with a new issue of $319.5 million, a 5.25% Series M perpetual preferred shares with net proceeds of $309.6 million and supplemented that with $160 million of cash.","Since we called for the redemption of the Series G and I preferred shares in December, they were classified as a liability on our December 31, 2017 balance sheet, as opposed to being included in shareholders' equity. Upon the redemption January 2018, we expensed the $14.5 million of issuance cost which will be included in our financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and treated as a non-comparable item.","As of today we have no 2018 consolidated debt maturities and our share partially owned entities 2018 maturity is $422 million, the largest of which is $276 million at share for Independence Plaza the three tower 1327 unit rental residential complex in Tribeca in which we own a 50.1% interest.","Excluding the financing on our 220 Central Park South project which will self liquidate as signed contracts close, our consolidated net debt metrics are fixed rate debt account of 78% of debt with a weighted average rate of 3.72% and the weighted average term of 4.3 years. And floating rate debt account for 22% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.21% and a weighted average term of 3.3 year.","Debt to enterprise value is 27.3% based on last night's closing stock price. Consolidated debt, net of cash to EBITDA is 5.8 times. Including our share partially owned entities net debt, excluding the nonrecourse debt of 666 Fifth Avenue and Toys \"R\" Us debt, net of cash to EBITDA is 6.9 times.","I would like to point out that in response to stakeholders request, our fourth quarter financial statements contain additional NOI disclosures which are also in our financial supplement on Pages 16 through 18. As Steve mentioned, our supplement also contains our updated annual NAV on Pages 10 and 11.","One word on the NAV, needless to say 220 Central Park South is a component of that NAV. We have used $900 million for the estimated after-tax profit coming from that job. That has not changed. If you go to last year's the same $900 million. We update that based upon the transfer pricing portion of Vornado's regular dividend, cash dividend to shareholders which is represented by fees and interest charge to 230 Central Park South.","Last year, 12\/31\/16 in our NAV that was $100 million. In this year's NAV, that's $250 million, the correct number for that should be $175 million this year. As we had in our press release when we announced dividend is approximately $0.36 of transfer pricing included in 2017 dividend was $75 million. The other $75 million increased our tax basis and was used to determine the after-tax gain that we started with of $900 million. On the website we\u2019re going to correct that.","In closing Vornado continues to maintain a fortress balance sheet with reasonable leverage, well staggered debt maturity. We have $4.1 billion in liquidity comprised of a $1.6 billion of cash restricted cash and marketable securities and our undrawn $2.5 billion revolving credit facility.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Steven.","Steven Roth","Thank you, David, thank you Joe. We\u2019re happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vikram Malhotra","Want to just check on Penn One, any other of any other details you can provide on potential spend, incremental return just timing?","David Greenbaum","We are finalizing our drawings in connection with the work that we're doing to Penn One. That work as I said is in the final stages. The budget should be available in the next three to six months at which point in time we'll disclose those budgets fully as we do it with all of our major capital projects.","Vikram Malhotra","And then just one clarification on the retail comment. Steve I think you mentioned the NOI will not drop below I think 309. So just wanted to get your sense of, is that sort of comment on 2018 and 2019 meaning 309 this year could be the low point?","Steven Roth","The answer is yes.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, thanks.","Steven Roth","Vikram I want to go back to One Penn for a minute. One Penn is a 2.6 million maybe 2.7 million square foot building in the very heart of Penn Plaza. It sits right adjacent to and has direct access into Penn Station. It's a formidable action which has spectacular views. The plan that we have to upgrade, modernize it and redevelop it is pretty spectacular. It has $73 in place rents we believe that there is huge opportunity for rent growth in that asset and we couldn\u2019t be more enthusiastic about it. We think when we combine the - as David call as the duo, One Penn is Two Penn - did I say $63 in place rents?","David Greenbaum","You said $73.","Steven Roth","David is correcting me and slapping me a little bit, the in-place rent in One Penn are $63 a foot which leaves enormous room for uptick there. So we couldn't be more enthusiastic about it and similarly when we accomplish the connection of One Penn and Two Penn into a four odd million square foot complex, where we can afford to do extraordinarily significant amenity packages and food operations we\u2019re very enthusiastic about this.","Vikram Malhotra","And just to clarify when - so you\u2019ll give us details potentially over the next three to six months and - it just sort of high level should we think about this as sort of one year project to two project, a just big picture how should we think about this?","Steven Roth","Yes, it\u2019s a couple of year project and our teams are in the process of completing the design group drawings and taking the bids and as soon as we have the cost estimates that we're comfortable with, we will of course make that information available.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","I guess sticking with Penn Plaza you know, if you think about Two Penn what needs to be in place for you to come up with some plans there and you know whether it\u2019s a thinking about leases and leases are expiring there or what happens with Gateway or any kind Penn Station redevelopment. How long should we be thinking until you can get some clarity there?","Steven Roth","Two Penn actually sits right a top of the train station so the first point Jamie is that the Gateway project which is a huge enormously important project, but a very long-term project has no bearing whatsoever in our plans for Two Penn or the Penn Plaza district so that step one.","Step two is, is that there's lot of stuff going on with Two Penn and our planning and different alternatives which is premature to talk about now, but whichever way they come out we think that they\u2019re incredibly exciting.","Jamie Feldman","And then I guess back to Joe's comments on the outlook for retail in 2018, I think you said you assume no additional leasing in the portfolio. So I mean just a handicap like if you were to get some leasing done like what's the drag there from no additional leasing as opposed to - you know probably a more reasonable outcome which is some renewals?","Joseph Macnow","Which I mean not only is the non-leasing but there is a credit loss built in and multimillion of dollars that typically we haven't incurred. So what we\u2019re telling you is 309, 310 is low end it could go up 5 million, 10 million.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Lewis with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Michael Lewis","Joe at the end of your comments you gave some detail on Central Park South, maybe I\u2019m slow I just want to make sure I'm clear on this. It looks like the budget for that project went up about $150 million. I don't know if it's safe to assume you still think the sellout is going to be about $3.2 billion. Could you help bridge that how they\u2019re still with those numbers they\u2019re still 900 million after the - and taxes and everything?","Joseph Macnow","The budget the producer project went up but so did the revenues go up - the budget and revenues go up and so did a reduction in the tax rate of the TRS go down. So net-net we think that the profit estimates that were originally made continue to hold.","By the way we are pretty far along the job - you know the job is probably 70%, 80% built, the job is well sold and so we have very good visibility into the numbers?","Michael Lewis","My second question, I know you get asked every quarter about 666 Fifth, there was a change this quarter kind of how you categorize that. So I guess you know it sounds like you think the future of the office component is as office. I was wondering - if you think there's material equity value in your interest or is this a case where you know you think that the plans that were presented don't really create value and now maybe you just give this back?","Steven Roth","First of all I mean there is no new news on 666 Fifth Avenue, I said a call or two ago in response to a question that it\u2019s complicated situation with lots of moving parts and I said at the end of my remarks a call or two ago that this was the rare instance where we may be sellers and the market and the press picked that up as saying that we were sellers. That is true and in our financials that were just published, we basically just formalized that fact, okay so that's step one.","Step two is, is that we have a relatively small investment in the property which we expect to get back.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi Financial. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","It's a Michael Bilerman, I\u2019m here with Emmy Korchman. Steve in your opening comments you talked about being in great shape for either defense or opportunity. So what are you looking at to know whether you should start spending some of this $2 billion cash forward and take advantage of opportunity or accelerate being a defense and selling more assets or stakes in assets because of what you see as the environment?","Steven Roth","Michael, we see every deal that goes down which has any relation to what our sweet spot is and believe me if we saw a deal that cancelled, we would pull the trigger. So one of the things that I use in order to gauge how a cycle is going is the pencil. So assets - we just are not a buyer of assets at the offered prices today okay. So we would rather keep our powder dry. So there is - that's where we are I mean we look at everything and we are very, very, very disciplined in investing.","Michael Bilerman","And Emmanuel has a follow-up as well.","Steven Roth","We expect them to be more opportunities in the future as there always is.","Emmanuel Korchman","Maybe a question for Joe or David. You spoke about the retail move-outs if you will or stresses in NOI. Is there anything in office bucket that we should expect to come up versus that would offset the contractual and why do we spoke about on previous calls?","Joseph Macnow","We have well call Jamie you know the normal turnover, I'm sorry Michael, we have the normal turnover in the office portfolio. So we do expect we\u2019re going to have a couple of move-outs. We also I mentioned Publicis in Chicago. Publicis also is a tenant at One Penn which is going to be moving out towards the latter part of this year, but it\u2019s the normal ins and outs.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Steve in your comments you talked about $1 billion of assets to be sold and I know that at least one or two quarters ago you identified another bucket of $1 billion of assets including some of the stakes you have in public companies. I'm just curious, is this the same billion you referenced in the past or is this a different billion of assets?","Steven Roth","I think it\u2019s the same Michael and I think it was last quarter that we referenced this - I\u2019d love to get that second billion but it\u2019s not there. So this is in a way of clean up - hang on, okay. So this is in a way of clean up and so that is - as I said this will take a couple of years to liquidate those assets.","So in addition, as I said in my remarks at 220 Central Park South as closings begin in 2019, we expect that also to augment our cash balances for the year definitely.","Steve Sakwa","And I guess as a follow-up maybe to Michael's question about you know kind how to deploy capital with the stock down in the kind of mid 60s here and your NAV at 96. I mean how do you just sort of think about share repurchases as a way to play offense and take advantage of opportunities we don't like I guess deals in the marketplace. How do you sort of way on stock price or?","Steven Roth","Steve that's a very good question. We look at buybacks all the time, we look at it at the management level. We look at it at every board meeting. So a buyback now would be accretive to NAV by a relatively smallish number but it would, it would - basically require reducing our balance sheet by a fairly significant number.","So for example, if we did a buyback of $500 million or a $1 billion that cash is gone and you get an accretion to the NAV of you know a number which is say a $1 a share give or take a little bit. So currently our board basically believes that we'd rather keep that keep that $1 billion of dry powder than increase it a very marginal amount though. Increase our NAV by a marginal amount. So that's step one although we know how to do buybacks we have done buyback they\u2019re not off the table they\u2019re on \u2013 in fact they are on the table at every meeting.","The second thing is that we discussed this with our bankers and other experts, there is no real evidence that a smallish buyback and for us a smallish buyback would be like for example a $1 billion actually increases stock price. So the answer to that is that right now we are not in the buyback business although we may in the future.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao","Maybe just sticking with capital deployment here, could you just remind us sort of where your current thinking is on the return expectations for the developments in the progress pipeline and specifically maybe some push on the new ones that were out this quarter.","Steven Roth","I'm sorry Vincent, could you say that again, returns on the development pipeline and what was the tail-end\u2026","Vincent Chao","Just in particular the news that we\u2019re added to the pipeline this quarter?","Cathy Creswell","You broke up again could you?","Steven Roth","So Joe why don\u2019t you publish a way across burn expectations?","Joseph Macnow","We have not.","Steven Roth","So as a policy we do not publish - return expectation in the beginning of a project because the numbers are subject to moving around too much. We do have a very strong confidence in the cost side of the development, but lesser in the income side. And our history has been that we almost always exceed our expectations on the income side. So the answer is that that when we get visibility into the numbers we published it and we don't like the publish speculative numbers.","Vincent Chao","And maybe a different question here just in terms of the NAV you alluded to the 50 basis point increase in the cap rate for the retail portfolio as well as some challenges facing the market today. I guess as you think about that I think the new cap rate assumption, do you think there is more risk to that going higher or lower at this point?","Steven Roth","That's speculation. I mean I think we are in the truth telling business and we thought that it was absolutely appropriate to raise the cap rate for retail to reflect what we believe is the market. And we think that that's a right number today that number could go down it could go up or it could stay the same that\u2019s too speculative for me.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","First Joe you had mentioned I think flat year-over-year FFO it was I correct in understanding that. And then could you talk about what your basis is are you looking at your FFO as a $0.98 fourth quarter run rate times four or what are you looking at as your 2017 number?","Joseph Macnow","John we did give our annual FFO we did give - all adjusted for comparability we did give fourth quarter a $0.98 a share. We said flattish but we\u2019re not going to say more than that flattish.","John Guinee","So flattish off of 3.73 for\u2026","Joseph Macnow","Yes.","John Guinee","So we should look at essentially 2018 FFO in the 3.73 range?","Joseph Macnow","Flattish.","John Guinee","Second David Greenbaum, I don\u2019t know why I haven\u2019t notice this before I'm looking at Page 32 full year and your GAAP rents are $74 and your cash rents are $76 on your second generation relet space which is highly unusual to have cash be higher than GAAP. That implies a rent roll down over the course of the year. Is that an accurate way to think about it?","David Greenbaum","John, we're scrambling - our team is scrambling to find that page and give you an answer what I prefer to do is let them contemplate the answer and get back to you offline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Your line is open.","Nick Yulico","Just going back to the street retail portfolio could you give us a feel for where in-place rents are today versus market specifically I guess going back to your cap rate assumption of 4.25% is that reflective of portfolio where rents are at market?","Steven Roth","The answer your first question there are some pluses and some minuses there are some I mean it\u2019s a large portfolio by far the largest in the city. There are many leases that are below market, there are some leases that are above market I don't - I\u2019m not so sure with what the net would be number one. Number two is, is that the cap rate is a number by the way NAVs are in precise numbers. The NAV or the cap rate or the new cap rate for the quarter is applied to the - income to the current income stream. It doesn\u2019t apply above market rents, it doesn\u2019t apply below market rent.","Nick Yulico","I guess I was just wondering if that cap rate is reflective of you know where values would be for portfolio where rents are at market?","Steven Roth","Yes, I think so.","Nick Yulico","Just second question is on G&A, last call there was some talk about your re-concentrating efforts on reducing G&A and that you said you might provide analysis on this I didn\u2019t see anything new on that topic. Could just gives us some detail on how you thinking about where you could reduce G&A this year and what would you assume maybe for 2018 G&A?","Steven Roth","Nick let\u2019s just talk about G&A for a moment it\u2019s a complicated analysis because each company has different accounting processes. So in our company the expense is in the G&A line but there is $20 million a year $5 million a quarter of income that comes in from the transitional services agreement and other fees for the two spins et cetera. So the published number of our G&A really when you look at it you should reduce that by $20 million so that step one.","Step two is we look at our sister company all the time and one of them has a $15 million of G&A that they push into the operating line and another one of them has lots of capitalized G&A or what have you. So when you take that altogether, the G&A of all the companies that are in very similar businesses are pretty much right on top of each other. Notwithstanding that we are going to make a major push in zero based budgeting on our G&A. And hopefully we will get some returns out of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Alexander Goldfarb","Two questions. So for the first one is the billion of dispositions that you outline if we assume sort of like you know 5% to 7% earnings yield on those assets it\u2019s t like if 50% 70% million. How do you think about replacing that on a FFO basis in a way that it\u2019s tangible for folks to see the earnings growth of the company versus the NAV stuff that you've done which is left tangible from a public stock perspective?","Steven Roth","The number is close to five and maybe even a little bit below five the number one. Number two is we are focusing our efforts on the assets that really have low yield or no yield. And then the second is that the trick is to reinvest the capital and by the way the billion dollars that we project is after taxes and so we retain that. So the idea is to reinvest that capital into assets which are core and which have higher return expectations.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then just a second is - the perennial question is on your succession the CFO search is almost coming up on a year and obviously there is talk for who would replace you. Are there certain things that you're at this point looking to achieve before we hear something new on the CFO or is your view to figure out what you want to do as CEO before coming out with the CFO?","Steven Roth","I mean I think those are all cogent thoughts which have - each of which has validity. So first of all I\u2019m clearly on the back nine I\u2019m clearly not going to go forever and I may even be on the back half of the back nine. So with respect to me, our Board focuses on that every meeting we have a succession plan in place if I were to be hit by a truck or whatever. And so you know that's enough about me there still is a fair amount to be done and there is no news other than what I just said about me.","With respect to the CFO search that\u2019s actually pretty interesting we have had a very good reception in the marketplace that people really think that this is a great job and a great opportunity. So we\u2019ve seen a lot of very nice very capable people. Interestingly enough we have some very nice and capable people here and we've learned in this search that our old warrior Joe Macnow is probably the number one candidate accept he is a little bit over the hill too.","So it's not a priority because we have a great staff in both in our premise operation and in Joe and there is other things involved that we don't have any news to report on that other than what I said.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jed Reagan from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Jed Reagan","Joe I think I heard you say that you expect portfolio cash same-store NOI growth would also be flattish this year versus last year, is that accurate?","Joseph Macnow","I'm sorry Jed the portfolio of cash did you say?","Jed Reagan","Yes, cash same-store NOI growth to be flattish 2018 versus 2017 was that right when I heard that?","Joseph Macnow","Yes, when you taken that retail going down flattish.","Jed Reagan","And just a clarification to follow-up on a question earlier on 666 Fifth office condominium in terms of deciding not to hold the asset longer-term. Just curious if you can talk a little about why you made that decision and what kind of time horizon you're looking at for potentially exiting your position there?","Steven Roth","The decision asset-by-asset is complicated we basically believe that the returns and the structure and the time is such that we would rather exit then stick it out, pretty much as simple as that.","Jed Reagan","Is that a 12 month type of horizon or two years or?","Steven Roth","I can\u2019t predict the timing I can't predict what we would like to have is the eventual outcome.","Jed Reagan","Got it that\u2019s helpful. And then one more if I may so the stocks been obviously trading at pretty a significant NAV discount for some time now and the discount increased a little bit here recently. I guess can you talk about your strategy for closing that NAV gap I mean do you see this as just a moment in time with the market kind of bearish on New York City. Are you looking at change course at all the respond to those discounts?","Steven Roth","That\u2019s a $64 question isn\u2019t it. So over the last number \u2013 but the first thing is that our observation is that we are not alone in the discount penalty box that all the companies in our industry segment and in other industry segments also have the same situation. And so there are a few industry segments that are selling at NAV or above. Our office is not one of them neither is retail. Okay, so that's the first observation Jed.","The second observation is that if you look back in history and not that far back we have moved heaven and earth to close that discount and to recognize shareholder value. We have sold over $5 billion of assets. We have simplified, we have spun Urban Edge, we have spun JBG Smith, so a total of $15 billion of transactions in that.","And so we think we have done a heroic job and more than anybody else has done and we acknowledge and admit with great unhappiness that it has not yet affected main course performance, okay. So having said all that we think we're resourceful, we have lots of ideas as I said some years ago everything continues to be on the table and it will be on the table. And closing that gap or getting our shares to reflect fair value is the number one priority in the day-to-day running of our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi Financial. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","Just had a couple of quick follow-ups. Just in terms of the NAV and I recognize Steve you said you don't think it\u2019s appropriate to have the pluses so that recognizing the minuses. I guess two things in relation to that. The first is, you guys are using full year 2017 NOI in the calculation and just thinking about where in places today its almost 3.5% higher using 4Q annualize which would probably be another almost $4 a share in NAV. So how I guess how do you think about using a historical trailing 12 versus spot.","And then the second part is in removing the schedule of the pluses the signed leases, can you give some details in terms of what has been signed that is going to commence, so at least we have that in our mindset from previous disclosure.","Steven Roth","NAV is a very, very in precise calculation, everybody does their own version of NAV you do, the analyst do, our investors do, and we do. So we have put out a NAV which we believe is very, very conservative and we think it's important that we do that. We are using a trailing number and actual number not a forward number. We're not making any projections as the income which is not commenced yet. We're not offsetting that. We are not taking any reductions in income they happens from move-out of vacancies and what have you. So we're happy with where we are, we spent a great deal of time thinking about it.","With respect to some other things basically most NAVs that the market participants use don't have a management fee in for running the assets. So we thought that was a little quirky so we put it in. So we\u2019re not unhappy with it. We think if we wanted to get the NAV up another 5 or 7 or 8,000 share we surely could, okay. But as of right now we think the conservative road is the road to go. By the way the stock doesn\u2019t seem to care what the NAV is anyway.","Michael Bilerman","No that\u2019s a separate question, but okay, I didn't know whether it was how you thought about in place signed current versus a trailing number. You obviously had a lot of growth over the course of the year as of a lot of that leasing took place and so I just didn't know whether it was a discussion point?","Steven Roth","Michael all that's true, but we found that it was intellectually barren put in the plusses without speculating what the minuses would be and we ended up just saying, okay, just leave them both. Michael let me just - so we\u2019re basically taking the trailing actual hard number right out of our docs and using that as a road map, which we think is a okay way to go.","Michael Bilerman","And then Joe just want to come back to this NOI, you talked a lot about flattish, I understand the retail this year was 3.24, the bottom end of 3.09 for 2018, in the fourth quarter you\u2019re actually at 3.33 annualized but put that aside. I am more interested on the office side of the business, the schedule that you had in the prior stuff on Page 9 still had about $36 million of signed leases incremental NOI that was on the come. And so I don\u2019t why the office business would be effectively flattish?","Joseph Macnow","First of all we don't give guidance as you know, okay, we are starting to link some statistics around the Edge, but we don't give guidance. We expect the office business to perform well next year and to grow. We expect the retail business to decline slightly, okay so when you put those two together we think the operating part of our businesses will have decent numbers next year.","When you go below the line, interest and other things we end up with the conclusion that give or take we're going to be flattish. Now flattish is a word that we have coined and we're going to - what's the word when you get - right, we had to copy write that word so that's where we are. We expect the office business to perform well, we expect New York to perform very well. The retail business will decline a little bit and that's where we are.","Michael Bilerman","My two sense would be you give the bottom line answer, I think we would appreciate all the components in terms of NOI, acquisitions, disposition, timing, capital markets activities, debt, equity, development spend, development timing, G&A, you gave us interest expense and a topline number. And then a bottom line flattish number you know and it's just - you go all the way or not basically, I guess it\u2019s more of comment then a question?","Steven Roth","Thank you. You got a lot of work to do.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","Just a follow-up for David. You had talked about the leasing pipeline, I think you said 900,000 square feet and 400, I think you said got done in the first quarter. Can you just talk more about the composition of that 900,000 and is it more kind of 34th Street area, is it more Midtown just to give a sense and the types of tenants?","David Greenbaum","The mix of the tenant that we're continuing to see just as we had a wide dispersion throughout all of 2017 with the fire sector having come back. So we're seeing the TAMI tenants, the fire tenants we're even seeing the medical institutions in New York that are expanding into office space all being players for space over in terms of the pipeline.","And in terms of you know where the activity is dispersed, the reality Jamie is it\u2019s basically all over the portfolio what I said is about 400,000 square feet that either have been signed or in lease negotiation, the balance of the space that we talked about the 900,000 square feet is pipelines in which case we\u2019re in the early stages of some lease discussion.","And for example in the last two weeks we've actually received a couple of proposals for 512 West 22nd Street, the new build on the high line each of which we\u2019re about 50,000 square feet. So we're seeing activity really everywhere in the portfolio Jamie and again broad spectrum in terms of tenant types.","Jamie Feldman","And then just back to Joe on the interest expense comment, can you just repeat what you did say about what interest expense will look like in 2018. And then just the earnings volatility or sensitivity to higher rates in 2018 and 2019?","Joseph Macnow","I think we've been pretty conservative in our estimate when I gave you that 15 million that took LIBOR over 2% at the end of next year and that's what built into our model.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn it back over to the host for final remarks.","Steven Roth","Thanks everybody very much. Our first quarter 2018 call is scheduled for 10 O'clock on Tuesday, May 1. We will see everybody there. Thank you. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

","I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thank you, Cathy and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we posted second quarter numbers that I can say we are once again, the best in town. Here's the math. FFO as adjusted was $0.98 per share as compared to $0.95 per share for the prior year second quarter, a 3.2% increase. On a cash basis, FFO as adjusted was $0.96 per share as compared to $0.88 per share for the prior year second quarter, up a very strong 9.1%. Cash basis NOI was $341.9 million, up 5.6% from the second quarter of 2017. This quarter's company wide cash basis same-store NOI increase was 7.0% comprised of New York Office, up 11.0%; retail, down 1.3% with the total New York segment, up 5.9%. theMART, up 10.8%; and 555 California Street, up 23.8%. ","This quarter's leasing activity was robust. We leased 611,000 square feet of New York Office space at a record average starting rent of $88.28 per square foot. The mark-to-market increase on 502,000 square feet of second-generation space was 41.3% GAAP and 28.4% cash. We leased 49,000 square feet of street retail space at an average starting rent of $165.98 per square foot, call it $166. The mark-to-market increase on 38,000 square feet of second generation space was 11.6% GAAP and 8.7% cash. At theMART, we leased 50,000 square feet at an average starting rent of $51.56 per square foot. The mark-to-market increase on second-generation space was 9.4% GAAP and 1.6% cash. As David will tell you in a minute, across-the-board, we are full. All of these metrics are very strong and industry-leading. By the way, these numbers validate why we believe theMART and 555 California Street have a lot of room to run. ","Our office business continues to perform very well. As I've said before, we are experiencing robust demand from all manner of industries in all of our submarkets. Our tenants are optimistic, aggressive, growing and upbeat about New York. As you can see from our New York Office mark-to-market cash increases of 50.3% in the first quarter, and 28.4% in the second quarter, great things happen when the rents reprice. The best example of this to come in New York and probably in the country is our Penn Plaza assets. Here, we are physically transforming One Penn Plaza and Two Penn Plaza, which aggregates 4.2 million square feet. Our assets here will take in-place rents for these assets from the low-$60s per square foot to market rents approaching $90 per square foot. These assets are in the heart of the new New York, adjacent to the Hudson Yards and Manhattan West developments and sit literally on top of the busiest train hub in North America. And I can't say it enough that we have actually positioned our portfolio -- actively positioned our portfolio so that full 50% of our office assets are located in the fast-growing West Side submarkets. ","Retail continues to be soft. While I am certainly not calling a bottom, there is noticeably increased retail activity in doors, albeit at rents in most submarkets substantially below the top pick. We reaffirmed our previous guidance that retail cash NOI will not go below $304 million, and we still expect GAAP FFO as adjusted for the year to be flat albeit, very nicely positive on a cash basis. ","The office investment sales market remains healthy but disciplined with volume up 15% year-over-year. Demand and pricing is very strong for assets in the south and west of Manhattan, and for deals under $400 million a function of investor preference to keep check sizes smaller at this point in the cycle. Pricing for large assets is stable though, bidding pools are thin and it's taking longer to execute. ","I will note the just announced $900 million sale of Terminal warehouse, a 1.1 million square foot, 130-year-old warehouse type building bounded by 27th and 28th Streets and 10th and 11th avenues, which just so happens to be across the street from our 260 Eleventh Avenue. 260 Eleventh, which is currently fully leased is on deck for our next generation of transformations. We are working here with the renowned architect Richard Rogers to reimagine this brilliantly located asset. By the way, the Terminal sale comes right on top of the blockbuster Chelsea Market sale to Google as another data point in the red hot Chelsea Market. ","There continues to be very little sales activity in the retail sector due to both a lack of quality product on offer and understandable investor skittishness. Pricing is clearly up for everything, except prime, AAA, well-leased assets. I would note that we are beginning to see the first signs of distress where retail assets that were borne at the topkick and loaded up with debt are starting to struggle. In many cases, the [indiscernible] mostly made by nonbank lenders and debt funds and in some cases, even the first mortgage, will be impaired. ","Debt markets for New York assets remain as liquid as strong as we have seen them with all markets wide-open. Although rates are up, spreads continue to remain tight keeping all-in coupons at attractive levels. We have a highly liquid fortress balance sheet with $3.8 billion in liquidity, a reasonable leverage and well-staggered debt maturity. David?","David Greenbaum","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Both total private sector as well as office-using employment in New York City continues to grow to record levels, albeit at a bit slower pace than in recent quarters. For the first half of this year, TAMI sector growth has been particularly robust at 7,000 new jobs, offset by slight declines in financial services and professional business services. This dynamic is yet another indicator of a phenomenon I've spoken about in recent quarters, which is the health and durability of the New York economy that has multiple growth engines. In 2017, it was financial services and professional business services that powered the job growth. The last 6 months has been the TAMI sector that's driven the growth. This diversity is a key underpinning of a very durable period of steady job growth. ","No surprise then that Manhattan leasing activity remained robust with 9.1 million square feet of new leases for the quarter. Absorption was a positive 2.8 million square feet, bringing the total year-to-date to positive 4.2 million square feet for the first half of the year and dropping the vacancy rate to 8.8%. Large deals continue to drive the market with 13 new leases greater than 100,000 square feet in the second quarter, 2 of which were our deals. Average asking rents in Manhattan are now hovering at $75 a foot and significantly for the first time led by rents in Midtown South. The overall market remains strong. ","Turning now to our own performance. As Steve noted, we turned in another very strong quarter in our New York Office business with 611,000 square feet of leasing activity and 37 transactions at average starting rents of $88.28, a new high watermark for us with very strong mark-to-markets of 41.3% GAAP and 28.4% cash. And importantly, walking in these robust rents for term with an average lease term of 10.5 years. ","In the quarter, we completed 2 substantial growth deals for anchor tenants at 770 Broadway and One Park Avenue. At One Park, NYU grew its new health care-related tenancy by 110,000 square feet across 3 floors. When we first acquired One Park Avenue in 2011, NYU occupied 144,000 square feet. With its most recent lease, NYU now occupies 632,000 square feet, a quadrupling of its tenancy. This expansion by NYU is reflective of continued growth in New York's healthcare sector, during the last 12 months represented almost 37% of the city's new jobs, more than any other sector. And at 770 Broadway, our anchor tenant expanded again, by 240,000 square feet, taking the total space in the building to 755,000 square feet. At Penn One, we executed 10 leases, representing 70,000 square feet at average starting rents of just under $70 a foot. ","Our office occupancy remains very strong at 96.6%. Our remaining 2018 expirations totaled 397,000 square feet, including only 3 blocks larger than 25,000 square feet. This includes Young & Rubicam's departure from 80,000 square feet at share at 825 7th Avenue where we and our 50% joint venture partner are undertaking a significant redevelopment. More than 1\/3 of our remaining 2018 expirations are at Penn One, where Steve as mentioned, we will embark on a major upgrade later this year. ","Our pipeline remains strong at over 1.1 million square feet, including 260,000 square feet of leases out in active negotiations. On the development front, we will deliver 2 top-quality boutique newbuilds in the third quarter, 512 West 22nd Street directly on the High Line and 606 Broadway at the Gateway to SoHo. ","At the Farley Building, Skanska's work on the dramatic new Moynihan Train Hall continues at a rapid pace. Already 75% of the new escalators down to track level have been installed and the first glass will appear in the mid-walk skylight in the next month, while framing of the acre-sized skylight over the train hall is well underway. We've commenced the demolition of the old post office installations to begin the preparation of the future office floors, which will be available for tenant sit-outs in a little over two years and are busy with tours and RFPs both for the 730,000 square feet of office space as well as the 120,000 square feet of ancillary retail train hall space. The bottom line for our office business in New York is our industry-leading same-store growth of 8.3% GAAP and 11% cash. ","Let me now turn to our best-in-class street retail business. For the quarter, we signed 8 retail leases totaling 49,000 square feet at mark-to-markets of positive 11.6% GAAP and 8.7% cash. The retailer slide to quality continues and activity has increased this year as brands begin to take advantage of lower asking rents and prime available corners. After a solid holiday season, a luxury center -- the luxury sector has begun to re-enter the market but only for the very, very best locations. We signed a lease with C\u00e9line, an LVMH brand, at 650 Madison Avenue moving them from 71st Street to one of Madison Avenue's heavily trafficked corners at 59th Street. Our retail occupancy stands at 96.3%. For the second quarter, our retail business was basically flat with a small same-store decline of 1.5% GAAP and 1.3% cash. ","Turning to theMART in Chicago, it was a quiet quarter with no new office leases. No surprise when you consider that the office space is 99.5% leased. Same-store growth was strong at 5.2% GAAP and 10.8% cash. ","As we've mentioned over the last couple of calls, we have a large lease with Publicis that expires in Q3 that is well below market and will continue to drive our same-store growth. While the office leasing is quiet, we signed 19 showroom leases totaling 50,000 square feet at average starting rents of just over $52 a foot. ","TheMART, which is the commercial hub of River North subdistrict soon will also be the cultural heart of the district with the launch of our Art on theMART project. It's a nightly video projection on the 115,000-square-foot masonry facade of the building, equivalent to a 2.6-acre canvas facing the Chicago river. When announcing the installation, mayor Rahm Emanuel described the projection as the largest permanent art installation in the United States. We hope you can join us in Chicago on Saturday evening, September 29 as we launch the inaugural exhibition. ","Finally, at our 555 California Street complex in San Francisco, we've also been very busy. In our last call I told you that we had completed the lease up of the redeveloped historic 315 Montgomery building. Today, I'm pleased to tell you that in the early days of the third quarter, we signed the lease for the entirety of the iconic cube, the former Bank of America Banking Hall. We are presently well underway on a $45 million redevelopment of this grand building that was purpose-built as a retail bank of which will now become a flagship 77,000-square-foot co-working environment for the recently launched spaces division of Regus IWG, the publicly held co-working giant. We're very proud that IWG selected this highly visible site to showcase its latest offering. ","We've also been active in the Tower and within the last week, we executed a lease with Bank of America to expand by 30,000 square feet bringing BofA's total occupancy in the building to 316,000 square feet. ","With the lease with IWG as well as Bank of America, we effectively have now brought the entire 1.8 million square foot 555 California Street complex to 100% occupancy. Same-store growth for this asset in the second quarter continued very strong at 13.5% GAAP and 23.8% cash. For the business as a whole, our same-store growth was 4.7% GAAP and 7% cash. With the best office and retail properties in the best submarkets, we remain very confident in our position and our prospects.","Steven Roth","Thank you, David. We'll be happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.","Stephen Sakwa","Steve, I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about sort of the portfolio repositioning that Vornado has been going through over the last couple of years and kind of where would you describe it in terms of its evolution, meaning how much do you think you have left to sell, including some of the stock positions and what do you think the timing is behind those?","Steven Roth","Good morning, Steve. First off, our office business [indiscernible] in Chicago and San Francisco, we think has a perfect mix of assets. As I said at the call and as I've said over the last number of quarters, we think in San Francisco, we think, we own the best assets in San Francisco, the rents are rising, it's 100% leased now and the growth rate of the mark-to-market in the building is pretty extraordinary. So we think [indiscernible] enormous amount of value in San Francisco. That asset is a keeper. You know, in the merchandise -- theMART in Chicago -- I'm still in the good days. You know theMART in Chicago, where we think we have created the most amenity centric 3.7 million square foot asset, that asset has lots of room to run, that's a keeper. In New York as you know over the -- following us for a long time, we are wildly enthusiastic about the prospects for Penn Plaza, the validation of the neighborhood at the bullseye in what I call the new New York, and we think that the rent growth that we can achieve there is quite extraordinary with the industry-leading and is probably -- certainly the best in New York and maybe even in the country.","We had curtailed our acquisition activity in the face of rising [indiscernible] and I think that I can say right now that I don't think I have any remorse about any asset that we haven't bought in the last 2 or 3 years, and we looked at every single one of them and chose to be extremely disciplined. With respect to the balance of our office -- with respect to the mix of our portfolio where we have been adding assets in the West Side market, even the Chelsea market [indiscernible] we think we've been exactly correct in that. We think that's where the rapid growth will be. And I would point to the 61 Ninth Avenue building that we built as a new build where we achieved $140 rents, which are, I might say, handsomely higher than even Park Avenue. Now, we announced some quarters ago that we have identified over $1 billion of noncore assets that we have on the for sale list. They are -- legacy real estate fund assets, they are some securities positions, they are some other assets that we have -- that don't get into our core. We are actively involved in marketing all of those assets and -- but it's slow going. Some of them are illiquid, some are more complicated, some of them have a little of hair. So we will accomplish that program but it will take us a little bit more time. What else do I need to answer your questions, Steve?","Stephen Sakwa","That's it for now. Just as a follow-up. You mentioned the distress in the retail area. It sounds like you might find some acquisition opportunities there. What's your sense as to kind of the timing and when some of those may kind of fall in your lap, is that a second half of '18 event or do you think that's more of a 2019 and beyond event?","Steven Roth","Certainly, not '18. This game plays out very slowly. And what I referenced was we're beginning to see struggling cracks. We're beginning to see lenders who are out of the money. We're beginning to see mezz lenders and debt funds and private lenders beginning to become aware of the fact that they are impaired. The process will take time. Now if we can buy an asset at 10% discount to what it sold for 3 or 4 years ago at toptick, we wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole. So what I'm saying basically is that we will get into that market and we will become an aggressive acquirer, but we will do it at the right time in the cycle and at the right prices.","Operator","Our next question is from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America.","James Feldman","Starting with the Chairman's letter and in recent conversations, there's a lot of talk about methods to close the NAV gap. So Steve, I was just hoping to get your latest thoughts on any activities that might be in process or just kind of where your head is in terms of I know you guys are doing a great job opening but any other thoughts out there?","Steven Roth","You know, I fluctuate between being trusted and getting pissed off. You can probably quote me on that, which I'm sure you will. We're not alone in the fact that our stock sells at a discount. If you go down the roster, everybody does. Some a little greater, some a little less. But there is, in New York, all the New York centric operators sell for approximately the same discount, with the exception of Boston properties, which sells at a discount, but a little better discount, a little bit less of a discount.","So this discount, and wrote in my letter that these discounts seem to be chronic and they seem to be, I said it, I think I said in my letter, that private LP investors, which represent 90% of the property ownership in the country, 90% are willing to pay 100% to 105% for assets that they are going to hold for a very long time on behalf of their pensioners or their employees or whatever the fund is. Public company investors seem to be willing to pay not more than 80% of the value of an asset. So this is a chronic thing. We have done I think way more than anybody else has done to begin to handle the difference between public and private market values. We spun off $10 billion of assets in 2 companies. By the way, which are faring and performing very well, so we think that was a great transaction. We've sold $5 billion or $7 billion of additional assets. We got ahead of the curve and sold more assets before that market break, et cetera. So now, and I said this and it has been speculated, we're not done yet. We will continue this strive to restructure so as to get the maximum value we can, the optimum shareholder value that we can. And so there's been speculation that we spin this, we may spin that, we may do some other things. So I can only tell you that we are actively thinking about every possibility and we're not done yet. It's premature for me to speculate or to say anything about what our plans might be in the future.","James Feldman","And can you just walk us through as we think about street retail for the back half of the year or even into maybe first half next year, just what the major moves are in terms of large NOI moves in and out of the portfolio?","Steven Roth","We have guided that the portfolio will not go lower than $304 million of cash, okay? I shouldn't say this and Joe's probably going to slap me, but I will, as we go through the math, we think that will better that number -- maybe even better that number by a fair amount. So basically, what's going on is that we have -- we have chosen to -- some of the known move outs, we have chosen to give very short-term leases to tenants at low prices. So that fits our numbers. We have 1 or two properties, which will go vacant over the next year or so which we do not yet currently have a replacement tenant for. And if we got a replacement tenant, it would be for lower rents than we're [indiscernible]. So it's that which makes up, makes up the Retail. Now on Fifth Avenue and Times Square, which represents a full 50% or more of our retail value, we're leased -- we're 100% leased for term and that income is rocksolid, and will rise as the contractual increases in rent come about. The only vacancy that we have coming up, which we have reported multiple times is 689 Fifth Avenue where we have a lease expiring sometime in the middle of next year, I forget the exact date and the lease income on that is below market, so we expect to achieve an increase there. So I think there you have it.","Operator","Our next question is from Manny Korchman of Citi.","Michael Bilerman","It's Michael Bilerman with Manny. Steve, I wanted to come back to sort of the strategic alternatives, strategic options, everything being on the table. Just in the sense of time, at what point do you start to eliminate certain things and tell the market, X, Y, Z is not going to work. We're going to go with A, B, C instead. When should the market be prepared to get the sort of an update in terms of everything being on the table versus things get removed and certain paths that you want to go down?","Steven Roth","Michael, hello. What you're asking is something that we can't do and we shouldn't do. We cannot -- we have to run the company, and it's really not appropriate for us to communicate what happens in our boardroom and what happens with our bankers as we deliberate and as we go forward. We just can't do that, okay? So we have a history of activity. We have a history of doing smart things and we're going to try very hard to continue that. But we can't just get into speculation or premature announcements [indiscernible].","Michael Bilerman","Right. Just the sense of how critical it is at this juncture, whether we should be expecting things to come about this year versus time that just goes by and the stock trades up, trades down, trade sideways wherever it may go.","Steven Roth","The answer to that is the same answer that I just gave you 30 seconds ago.","Michael Bilerman","All right. On 260 11th Avenue, you bought 537 West 26 as well last quarter, in the first quarter. Can you talk a little bit about maybe the entirety of scope in terms of what you have as of right build with the [indiscernible] that you have, the timing upon which you would commence something and something in terms of total capital, additional capital that may be required for it?","Steven Roth","Well, 260 11th Avenue is a great asset. We bought it, how many years ago, David?","David Greenbaum","Three, 2015.","Steven Roth","Three, four years ago, which I think was exactly the right time to invest there. It's directly across the street from Starrett-Lehigh. It's catty-corner across the street from this Terminal warehouse that just sold for $900 million. So it's 3 blocks out of Hudson Yards, so it's a pretty terrific asset. It's exactly the kind of -- it's the old Otis Elevator headquarters. It's exactly the kind of asset that our creative class tenants want. And by the way, we also have had looksies from some more traditional businesses who want to transform their business by creating -- by attracting and recruiting a different kind of team. So there's that. Now we own the building. We also own a lot, which is vacant, so we will expand the building with a new build that will, what's the word, David, that will...","David Greenbaum","Integrate?","Steven Roth","Integrate, good. Integrate into the Otis Elevator building. We have brought in Richard Rogers who has an incredibly interesting skill set to reimagine this building, and meld the old and the new into the modern age. We think we're going to create something that's pretty extraordinary. We bought something that's called Cedar Lake, which is a one-story landmark district events space. How big of a floor, is it? 10,000 feet? Which has 10,000 square feet, and we brought it as an adjunct for the -- it's contiguous to -- we bought it as adjunct to 260 11th because if you think about it for a second, a company that goes in and takes that full building can use that adjacency for presentations, for sales, for events, for whatever, so we thought it's very interesting -- and by the way, that's the only building in town that has that kind of adjacency. The building is fully leased now to one tenant and what we're doing is we're going through landmarks, we're preparing for a reimagination of that building. We will not start that until maybe three years from now, two years from now, and that will involve canceling the lease, getting all our approvals, getting ready to go, et cetera. What might accelerate that is if a tenant comes in -- and by the way, we're really not actively marketing the building. If a tenant comes in, the community knows about the asset. So if a tenant came in, had to have the building then maybe we would accelerate that. We're not going to start this thing for I guess, 3 years. We are not ready to release budgets or statistics on this, and so I think that's my answer.","Operator","Our next question is from Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Maybe just some specific questions about street retail. Within the portfolio, I believe you had expirations coming up on Madison, three stores, in particular, which I think were likely to move out, 830 Madison Avenue. Can you give any update on those three tenants?","Steven Roth","We expect those tenants will likely vacate, and we do not have replacement tenants for them yet.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. And just on that street retail. If I look at next year, and I'm not looking for guidance or any specific numbers but just for the leases signed essentially, Sephora, Levi's and Forever 21, can you give us a sense of the cash NOI contribution from those three in '19?","Steven Roth","We have that number?","Joseph Macnow","It's going to be roughly about 20 to 23.","Steven Roth","Tom said, it's going to be roughly 20 to 23. I'd like to have the accurate [indiscernible].","Vikram Malhotra","Yes, I can follow. I can follow up with you, guys.","Steven Roth","We'll take your next question and then when we find it [indiscernible].","Vikram Malhotra","Just last thing, some of your peers, especially in New York City have called for a midtown -- have called for a rebound in midtown rents maybe during the next 6 to 9 months. Can you give us your sense, do you agree? Disagree? What are you seeing in terms of rent trends in your market?","Steven Roth","What we're seeing is the West Side is on fire. What we're seeing is that Penn Plaza is doing wonderfully well. What we're seeing is that space is getting tight, the economy is very strong, people want to expand and there is activity in the traditional midtown market, but it is nowhere near as vibrant as the West Side market. What's more, we're looking over our shoulder at the new supply that is coming to the -- as a result of that West Side Hudson Yards, Manhattan West developments sucking million of feet out of the traditional midtown market. So it's difficult to understand what that will do. There are some folks who think that job growth absorb that space. That may be a little bit aggressive but over time, certainly it will be. So what we're saying is that we're 100% leased in our midtown assets but the growth that we are realizing, the extraordinary growth comes from the West Side.","David Greenbaum","We can get back, Vikram to the--","Steven Roth","What's the number?","Joseph Macnow","20. In 2019, the cash coming out of those 3 leases is approximately $20 million. By the time they fully stabilize in 2020, it's about $28 million, $29 million.","Steven Roth","Forever 21, Levi's, Sephora. Forever 21 [indiscernible].","Operator","Our next question is from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","A question on theMART. The office conversion has been a success. Steve, you mentioned there's still room to run. But in this market you have the owners of a Willis Tower and the main post office basically trying to emulate what you've achieved on large-scale iconic buildings, and I'm wondering how that impacts your ability to achieve the kind of rental growth that you had so far going forward?","Steven Roth","The answer is that the room to grow and the room to run is that we have [indiscernible] the publicist -- how do you pronounce it?","David Greenbaum","Publicis.","Steven Roth","The Publicis lease that expires is in the low-30s and the market rents for that space is in the mid- to high-40s. So there you have a 25% to a 35% increase right there. Almost every piece of a space that we will get back and rollover is under market and what have you, okay? That's one step 1. Step 2 is that we have the dominant building in the marketplace. We have the dominant building in the marketplace, by far. We have a franchise, and we get a premium through our competitors, which I believe will hold, and if it doesn't hold, we're still doing great. So we own this building, we have the lowest basis in town and the most attractive space in town. We do not shy from competition because the competition makes the district that our building is in, makes it even better and more in demand. For example, if there were one building in Park Avenue, Park Avenue wouldn't be Park Avenue. What makes Park Avenue is the 50 million square feet of tenants that are there doing business with each other, et cetera, et cetera. We can't stop the competition and we'll all be fine.","David Greenbaum","I might just add that over the next three years, in the building there's a total of about 425,000 square feet, all of which as Steve referred to are rents well, well, below market. Office space.","Steven Roth","And that represents 10% or 11% of the building, it's not a significant number.","John Kim","Got it. Okay. And then a question on retail...","Steven Roth","By the way, if you haven't seen the building lately, give us a call and we'd love to show it to you. And that invitation, of course, is open to everybody on the call.","John Kim","We'll take you up on that.","Steven Roth","Okay, good. We want you to. And by the way, similarly, I think NAREIT this November is in San Francisco, and we intend to do tours and an event at 555 California on that occasion. So you're all invited to that, too.","John Kim","I had a question on retail and the impact of discount retailers like Five Below entering Fifth Avenue. I realized that it's 2 blocks south where most of your assets are, but I'm wondering how do you think this impacts the perception of Fifth Avenue retail and potentially rents and value going forward?","Steven Roth","I don't know. The Five Below thing has sort of a desperation look to it. The difference between Upper Fifth Avenue and lower Fifth Avenue is enormously -- the demographic and profile of the customer, of the street traffic, of the occupant, [indiscernible] is like night and day. So there's that. By the way, the rents are multiples -- Upper Fifth Avenue rents are multiples of what lower Fifth Avenue is. So I don't think it will have any effect. It's not something that I worry about actually. So while Five Below may be going 20 blocks south or something like that, Nike is opening their world flagship, you have to come see it, adjacent to our Victoria's Secret store they're on -- we share the block, [indiscernible] we're on the 51st Street side, they're the 52nd Street side, it's a 7-story behemoth. It's going to be extraordinary. But I would rather focus on what Nike will do to traffic and values rather than what Five Below will do.","John Kim","If I could just squeeze one more in. This morning we had the announcement of Brookfield buying Forest City, and you talked about a number of office companies trading at significant discount to NAV. And I'm wondering if you think we'll see more consolidation or privatization in this sector?","Steven Roth","Possibly. Possibly.","John Kim","Can you argue that there's an advantage of being private rather than public?","Steven Roth","Say that again.","John Kim","Is there an advantage to being private and privately run versus a public company?","Steven Roth","That's too loaded a question for me. I will tell you that the business format, the asset-light business format of the real estate funds is one might think a better format than the public companies, which basically are asset-heavy, so there's that, I can tell you that the comp for the private real estate companies out front is better than the public companies by a wide margin. And I can tell you, in easy money times such as this, which may be coming to an end but may not be, the advantage that the public companies have access to capital does not exist. Private companies have as much access to capital, if not more. So it's fun to be the head of a public company, it's fun to be a head of a private company, it's all fun.","Operator","Our next question is from Daniel Santos of Sandler O'Neill.","Daniel Santos","I was wondering if you could comment specifically on what the tax implications would be if you were to sell some of those noncore assets you've identified?","Steven Roth","Joe?","Joseph Macnow","Daniel, we said that originally, there was about $1,250,000,000 of assets, and we would be able to retain $1 billion of that, meaning that there was tax gains of about $250 million which would be distributed to shareholders barring some other event [indiscernible] needs. And that really hasn't changed very much. Now look, some assets have been added like 666 Fifth Avenue, some assets have been sold, over $100 million has been realized to date but that's roughly the numbers. About $1 billion of the $1,250,000,000 would be retained by us.","Daniel Santos","Got it. That's helpful.","Steven Roth","That's pretty good and pretty attractive, we think.","Daniel Santos","Agreed. My next question is on Crowne Plaza...","Steven Roth","By the way, Daniel let me just say one more thing about that. You know that it's not a free lunch. These assets have, on average, a return to them, this $1 billion that we're talking about, in the 4% to 5% range. So selling them is dilutive until we replace those earnings but then we're very, very, very cognizant of that. The second thing is that we spent a lot of time understanding what the clearing price of the clearing strategy of knocking those assets out more quickly is [indiscernible] possible that the clearing price to get speed on that might be $100 million less than we projected, which in the scheme of things is a great deal of money but in the scheme of things, it's not.","Daniel Santos","Got it, that's helpful. And my next question is on Crowne Plaza. Can you give us an update there and your ability to rebrand it?","Steven Roth","We have a franchisee, and we have a relationship. There's litigation pending about that relationship and other than that, I have no comment.","Operator","Our next question is from Jed Reagan of Green Street Advisors.","Joseph Reagan","Just to follow-up another question in terms of rent growth. Can you quantify how much net effect of rent growth you're seeing on the West Side, that Penn Plaza, Chelsea area? And then may be related to that, just curious how you'd characterize concession trends across Manhattan at this point?","Steven Roth","David?","David Greenbaum","Jed, I think part of that is concessions, which I think has been flat. As we look at our numbers and so we went back over the last 3 years and on average, and what we look at is the metric that I think most of guys consider TIs per square foot per annum as a percentage of the starting rent. Obviously, as the starting rents have significantly increased, so that in this quarter the number of $88.28. Now, our average TIs as a percentage of starting rents was 7.8%, which to us is really well-contained, and it's been very leveled in the range of the 7% to 8% range over the last 36 months. So we're seeing little no further pressure in terms of concessions and seeing those numbers stabilized. Obviously, that is having a positive impact on net effects as we have seen continuing rent growth in the markets that Steve talked about, the West Chelsea market and also in our Penn Plaza District where as I said on the call, rents for this quarter average rents for all of our leases at One Penn were at $70 a foot.","Joseph Reagan","But on a year-over-year basis, recently is that a low single digits, mid-single-digits or sort of hard to put your finger on it?","David Greenbaum","Listen, it's all dependent obviously, on which pieces of space are coming up in the buildings but as you look at that whole West Side district, that's where we have really seen what I refer to as a fairly explosive growth in rents over the last number of years. Over I'd say the last 12 months or so, those numbers on the West side basically have been stable to [indiscernible] probably low single digit growth.","Joseph Reagan","Okay. And then I guess sticking on the West Side. Any update on how you guys are thinking about plans at Two Penn Plaza? And do you have any more clarity on whether you'd go the redevelopment route or a potentially full teardown and rebuild?","Steven Roth","I think we said on the last call, the call before, that we have abandoned the teardown, and we are full-speed ahead on the redevelopment and reimagining -- the reimagining of Two Penn, which will go into a complex with Two Penn and One Penn -- Two Penn and One Penn connected into a 4.2 million square foot complex. The advantage of having a campus like that, which is on top of the train station, you can get from both buildings to the train station without going outside into the rain and snow, and you can get from one building to the other building with also not going outside is that we can service our tenants with greater amenities, this is 4 million feet, not 500,000 square feet. And the second is as our tenants grow, which is really the lifeline of our business, as our tenants grow we can always find space for them for growth in the 4 million feet.","Joseph Reagan","Great. Are you in any position to sort of size the cost of that project or economics around the Two Penn project?","Steven Roth","Not yet. I did say in my remarks that we expect to take the rents from the low-$60s to approaching $90s. So that will be a feel for what we think about income side of that. Now remember, and I know you know this, that we only realized that uptick as leases roll. So what we're talking about is in-place rents are in the low-$60s and we believe the market when we get done and however long it takes, will be approaching $90. With respect to the cost of the project, we're still involved in bidding and plans and estimating. We're not ready to release that number.","Operator","Our next question is from John Guinee of Stifel.","John Guinee","David, it looks like you have had stunningly good lease spreads in the first half of this year. Looks to me with an average in-place rent of mid-$80s, that should slowdown in the second half but then 2019, with an in-place rent of $63, you have the potential to replicate the first half of this year. Is that accurate? Or are there not the same magnitude of spreads available for the next 18 months?","David Greenbaum","I'll first talk to a minute about the second half of this year, so there are a number of leases that are coming back to us through the end of this year that are at very high rents, which is the reason that you're seeing some average rents of, I think, it's about $82 a foot for the space coming up through year-end. On those, most of [indiscernible] will be flat, and a couple cases there'll be some rolls down what have been some very, very high rents. As we look out into '19 and the future, we remain very optimistic in terms of the spreads that we can achieve on the portfolio.","John Guinee","Okay, great. And then Steve, 2005 to 2015 was the golden age of REITs, declining cap rates, declining interest rates, raising NAV, positive fundamentals, lot of positive fund flows to the rededicated crowd, a real NAV bias in the way people look at things. If your crystal ball said to you that, that's just not going to happen again. There's not going to be an NAV bias in how people underwrite REITs and if multiples going forward, with interest rates going up are more in the 15 to 16 range, which is on a $4 FFO sub-$60 a share for a company like Vornado. If your crystal ball said that to you, would you step up any thought process strategically or how would you think about things?","Steven Roth","Well, first of all, I like you a lot but I don't like your comments. Obviously, we think about that all the time. So the answer is yes. I don't know that we see the same level of ugliness in the marketplace that you do but we're prepared for everything. So the answer is yes.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Steven Roth","Thank you all very much. We appreciate -- by the way, I think it was my friend Tony Malkin who made a comment on his earnings growth that he was a hero and won the race for the shortest prepared remarks. So I'm happy to let him win that, but we completed this call in 58 minutes, which is a record for us, and so we thank you all very much, and we'll see you on the next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

During the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin. ","Catherine Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust third quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our third quarter earnings release and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Also, in the room are Michael Franco, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer; Joseph Macnow, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer; Mark Hudspeth, Executive Vice President and Head of Capital Markets; Matt Iocco, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Tom Sanelli, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, New York Division.","I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thanks, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. If I may, let me start by breaking a little bit. Our leasing numbers continue to be the best in the business. Year-to-date for three quarters across the entire business, including New York Office, Retail, theMART, and 555 California Street, our leasing activity totals over 2 million square feet and 179 leases with outstanding mark-to-markets of 33.8% GAAP and 24.1% cash. Thanks to Glen and our best in the business leasing team.","Yesterday, we posted third quarter numbers. Here's the math. FFO as adjusted was $0.97 per share even with the prior year's third quarter. Our GAAP based as financial results for this quarter were negatively affected by $4.5 million, largely from non-cash, straight-line rent receivable write-offs. These GAAP accounting items did not affect our cash, our cash basis results. Remember, we run the business on cash numbers. Our third quarter cash basis FFO was adjusted with $0.95 per share, as compared to $0.89 per share for the prior year's third quarter up a strong 6.7%.","This quarter's companywide cash basis NOI was $340.9 million, up 2.7% from the third quarter of 2017. Adjusting for the sale of our half interest in the 666 Fifth Avenue office condominium, the increase was an even greater 3.8%; more about 666 in a minute.","Cash basis same-store NOI increased by 4.3%, comprised of New York office was up 5.1%, retail was up 4.2% benefiting by $4.9 million one-time real estate tax abatement catch up, with the total New York segment up 3.9%. theMART was up 2.2% and 555 California Street was up 19.9%. This quarter's leasing activity was robust, which David will cover in a minute.","Our office business continues to perform very well. I'll say again what I've said for the last several quarters, we are experiencing robust demand from all manner of industries in all of our submarkets. Our tenants are optimistic, aggressive, growing, and upbeat about New York.","Everybody knows that I think our Penn Plaza assets are our main events. I have even called Penn Plaza the \"Promised Land.\" Our transformation here will begin with Penn One and Penn Two, where we will create a two building 4.4 million square foot campus right on top of Penn Station. It will include a three block, Grant Plaza along Seventh Avenue covered by a giant new bustle across the entire 400 foot frontage of Penn Two. This plaza will stand out 70 feet from the building and will be 45 feet above the street. It will serve a dual purpose. It will be striking, creating a huge covered plaza in front of our Penn Two and the main entrance to Penn Station, and bring the neighborhood into the modern age. And at the same time, it will create a 140,000 square feet of very valuable new 220 foot high best-in-class creative space. Images of this design will be posted on our Web site tomorrow under the call sign www.vno.com\/portfolio\/development.","The scale of our campus here allows us to provide our tenants with the best -- with the biggest and best unparalleled amenity package. Even a giant leap forward from what many of you seen we have done at theMART. Also in Penn Plaza, we are well underway at Farley to deliver in 2020 the best creative space in Manhattan. We will be announcing later today that we are increasing our ownership in Farley, and there is much more to come in the Penn district. These assets are at the heart of the new New York adjacent to the Hudson Yards and Manhattan West developments, and sit literally on top of the busiest transportation hub in North America. And don't forget the adjacencies to the Macy's, the biggest department store in the country and Madison Square Garden.","Speaking of theMART, David will tell you about a huge art projection we launched last month. A rotating group of artists will design images projected over the entire facade of the building. This is really innovative and exciting stuff, a Musti in Chicago. Our objective here is to increase the franchise value and renounce of this iconic 3.7 million square foot building.","Time Square is the best performing retail submarket in Manhattan. A highlight of the quarter was our September 24th acquisition from host hotels of the 46% interest in 1535 Broadway retail condominium that we did not already own. The original transaction provided that we would become a 100% owner through a put\/call arrangement based on a pre-negotiated formula. This acquisition satisfied the put\/call arrangement.","We now own 100% of the retail, which is a 100% lease to T-Mobile and [indiscernible] as well as the largest digital site in New York. This project has now completed as a first year cash on cash yield of 8.5%, obviously very accretive and value creative. Elsewhere, retail continues to be soft albeit there is increased retailer activity and tours. At the beginning of the year, we guided that our 2018 retail cash NOI would not go below $304 million. We are now comfortable that retail cash NOI on a recurring basis will be at least $350 million.","We have begun closings that are 220 Central Park South Supertower 100 million projects. Closings will continue throughout 2019 as we climb up the building. We are approaching 85% sold. Here is a factoid for you. In the 1,000 foot tower, we built 27 large full floor apartments of which 26 are under contract. The press is telling us that the condo market in New York is soft or even worse than that, that will may well it be for some, but I point out that we went to contract on two large full four apartments just this month leaving only one out of 27 left. 220 Central Park South has exceeded all expectations and is well into a record setting territory.","Its old news now but we didn't cover the sale of our interest in 666 Fifth Avenue office on last quarter's call and here it goes. Sometime ago we made a decision and announced that we preferred to sell out of 666 office rather than participate in a five year capital eating renovation. As previously announced the sale was completed on August 3. We received proceeds of $120 billion plus $57 million from loan repayments.","The financial statement gain in the year was $142 million and the tax gain was $244 million. We wish our former partners and their new partners all success. Capital markets are pretty much unchanged over the last year with the [technical difficulty] same office, investment sales market remained healthy, but disciplined with volume up 20% year-over-year; the smaller the deal size, the easier to execute. Phasing for large core Manhattan asset is stable is stable, the bidding pools are thin, and it's taking longer to execute these sales. There is continuously - there is continued strong demand and pricing in particular for assets in the west and south of Manhattan.","While foreign capital continues to be active, more of the activity this year is being driven by U.S. based capital sources. Debt markets for New York assets remain as liquid and strong as we have seen. While the base rate for 10 year treasury at LIBOR is up about 75 basis points this year, tightening spreads have offset about a third of this increase.","We count can at least 50, and maybe as much as double that number of debt funds that have been formed since the beginning of this cycle, who are all competing aggressively on a rate and loan-to-value loan to value basis for both whole loans and mezzanine positions. We have a highly liquid fortress balance sheet, with $3.5 billion in immediate liquidity, measured leveraged and well-staggered maturities. And this doesn't count a couple of million dollars to come from 220 closings and non-core asset sales.","Now, to my partner, David.","David Greenbaum","Steve, thank you. Good morning, everyone. The New York City economy remains strong. We've now had 35 consecutive quarters of private sector job growth, truly an extraordinary run. September mark the 12th consecutive month at that New York City unemployment remained below 4.5%, the longest such period on record.","While office using employment has been flat this year, the city has seen more than 22,000 new healthcare positions, which are not captured in office using employment. In our loan portfolio, we have Columbia University at 1297 Avenue the Americans with 123,000 feet, Memorial Sloan Kettering at 650 Madison with 100,000 feet, and NYU line going at One Park Avenue with a total of 630,000 square feet which are 150,000 with the growth this year.","Over the last two quarters, new leasing activity in Manhattan reached 18.6 million square feet; the strongest two quarter total on record. Overall, asking rents held the firm at almost $73 a foot. Class-A rents in Manhattan in midtown remain robust at $83 a foot. With year-over-year financial services sectors earnings growth of 24%, a fire sector in fact is now on fire with 53% of Manhattan's third quarter leasing activity. The two dominant themes in the market remain in the growth of co-working tenancies and the flight to New and renovated products.","Let me now turn to our own performance in the third quarter, where we executed 23 office leases totaling 312,000 square feet, driving occupancy up 70 basis points to 97.3%. Our average starting rent for the quarter was just over $67 a foot. Of course, starting rents obviously fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the mix of buildings and the space leased. The key statistics is the mark-to-market increase and our mark-to-markets remain very strong, an increase of 26.5% GAAP and 11.8% cash.","Our office business in New York, sort of same store NOI growth of 1.2% GAAP and 5.1% cash. A most significant lease in the quarter with a head quarter's deal at 90930 Avenue [indiscernible] a large and important strategic communications firm that took 65,000 feet. Another important transaction took place at 330 West 34th Street where IAC owned HomeAdvisor 65,000 feet. Another important transaction took place to 330 West 34th Street where IAC owned HomeAdvisor expanded doubling its footprint to 90,000 square feet and bringing 330 West to 100% occupancy completing the redevelopment of this asset.","At Penn One, we've used 82,000 square feet with 80% of that activity representing the movement of tenants from Penn Two. As you know, our prior year end, we will commence our significant renovation program at Penn One that will transform the 2.6 million square foot asset with an expanded double height lobby and acre of upgraded Plaza's co-working and conferencing facilities and a robust amenity package with food offerings and tenant services spanning the entire second and third floors.","At Penn Two, we are now finalizing plans for a dramatic renovation and expansion of its existing 1.6 million square foot asset located directly on top of Penn Station. Turning the two buildings and Penn One and Penn Two into what will be a 4.4 million square foot campus. Penn Two project will include a fully [indiscernible] new mechanical systems, a new tenant entry sequence adjacent to Plaza 33 all integrated with a full amenity package and as Steve mentioned, the addition of a striking four-storey Basel that will transform both the existing building and the public realm.","In connection with this redevelopment, we will be vacating Penn Two up to the 10th floor and we have begun relocating number the tenants from Penn Two into Penn One. We anticipate starting physical work in Penn Two in the first quarter of 2020. The government continues to focus on the transformation of Penn Station and the area around it. Since last month, Governor Cuomo made a speech that included several significant announcements.","With the construction of the new Moynihan Train Hall on-time and to be delivered in 2020, the governor reiterated his intent to upgrade the Long Island Railroad concourse beneath 33rd Street, doubling the width of the most congested corridor in the station. As a reminder, we own the retail on the north side of this concourse, which is on to One Penn Plaza. The governor also announced a plan to transform the temporary Plaza in 33rd Street into a permanent Plaza, including a new station entrance as well as announcing that the state would undertake a collaborative planning effort, the entire neighborhood.","We of course applaud all these initiatives and the area's local representatives as importantly are doing the same. In a recent address, City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, whose district includes Penn Plaza, strongly endorsed a new planning framework to increase density in the district, improve all public spaces and transform the station. It is clear that the momentum for a major change in the district is accelerating.","In other development activity, we have substantially completed 512 West 22nd Street where we are in active negotiations with perspective tenants and I've also substantially completed 606 Broadway where we have leases out for both the office and retail space in the building. Looking ahead, our leasing pipeline remains active at over 700,000 square feet, including 200,000 square feet of leases out and an active negotiation. Our remaining 2,000 expirations total just over $300,000 square feet and our 2019 explorations are a modest 675,000 feet.","Let me now turn to our street retail business. For the quarter, we signed 10 retail leases totaling 104,000 feet including a 78,000 square feet renewal with Old Navy 134 Street. Similar to our strategy earlier this year, we're forever 21 at 435 Seventh Avenue. We elected to renew Old Navy short-term for five years and eliminated any further tenant renewal options. This positions us to take advantage of rent growth as our transformation of the district proceeds as well as maintaining our development options for the site.","With retailers drawn to the neighborhood extraordinary foot traffic, we also assign new leases with shoe store naturalizer at Seven West 34th Street, Starbucks at 330 West 34 Street, and Fast Casual Food Purveyor dig in at 11 Penn Plaza. Our retail mark-to-markets for the quarter were negative 40% GAAP and positive 36.3% cash. It is counter-intuitive to have a large GAAP negative and a large GAAP cash positive.","Let me explain. While the Old Navy renewal was at a significantly higher cash rent, which drove the strong cash mark-to-market. Faz 141 purchase price accounting required us at acquisition of this asset to mark the rent up to the then market which is now proved to be too high producing the negative GAAP number. If you back out the Old Navy lease, our mark-to-markets were up 13.9% on a GAAP basis and 10% on a cash basis. Our retail occupancy stands at 96.6%, up 30 basis points for the second quarter. Thanks to our NOI growth for our retail business was up, a positive a 2.9% GAAP and 4.2% cash. ","Turning to theMART in Chicago, we have good activity on the former [indiscernible] space, a 132,000 square foot block spread across portions of the fourth and fifth floors, and we just got back in the third quarter. This is a growth opportunity as the rent on the former [indiscernible] space was significantly below market at less than $32 per square foot. We're in discussions with an existing Mark tenant seeking to expand as well as where the TAMI tenants in our in New York portfolio that also has submitted a proposal for a portion of space.","For the quarter we saw nine showroom leases and three retail leases including an Amazon Go, gauche store all totaling 28,000 square feet and an average starting rent of $57.92 per square foot. The mark-to-market increase for the quarter was positive 14.4% GAAP and 1.9% cash. As Steve mentioned on September 29, we launched our permanent exhibition of Art on theMART, more than 32,000 Chicagoans descended on Wacker Drive to see the inaugural display of the work of four digital artists which will continue five nights a week for two hours 10 months of the year. With twice the clarity of a 4K Ultra HD TV this 2.5 acre campus is simply extraordinary.","Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the displayed \"a visionary project to that bring Chicago's project\" that brings Chicago's legacy of public art and iconic architecture into the future. As the largest permanent art installation in the United States, city officials expect to display to become as much of the Chicago staple as the 00:21:56 being at Millennium Park and the Picasso at Daley Center Plaza. From our perspective the art display strengthens the franchise value of theMART and cements its position as nothing less than the most important office building in Chicago.","For the third quarter at theMART our GAAP same store NOI performance dropped 3.8% primarily due to the July 31 publicist departure while cash same store was up 2.2%. Let me conclude with San Francisco where our 555 California Street complex remains the most iconic office location in the city. As I told you in the last call in the early days of this quarter we signed a 15-year lease with the spaces concept of Regus IWG the entirety of the former banking hall of the Cube at 345 Montgomery. We're making good progress on this $45 million redevelopment transforming it from the old banking hall into a 78,000 square foot modern co-working environment that we will deliver next summer.","We have largely completed the abatement and demolition activities and are now progressing with the main structural elements that support the expanded and additional floors. In the tower at 555, we signed three leases totaling over 82,000 feet including two-floored tenure renewal with UBS and a full floor expansion with Bank of America bringing its occupancy in the complex to almost 330,000 feet.","With average starting rents over $91 a foot, our mark-to-markets were very strong at 30.4% GAAP and 10.4% cash. Same-store NOI growth in the third quarter also remain very strong at 17.2% GAAP and 19.9% cash. We look forward to showing off this flagship asset next week during new week, and hope you'll join us for these festivities on the plaza of 555 California on Tuesday evening.","I'm also pleased to announce that Vornado 00:24:17 2018 Leader in the Light Award. This is the ninth consecutive year we've been recognized as the highest scoring diversified REIT. Contributing to our success in earning the Leader in the Light Award was Vornado's highest standing in the global real estate sustainability benchmark was referred to as Grez.","In 2018, Vornado is the number three among all listed real estate companies in the United States, and placed in the top 6% of 847 gross respondents worldwide. The business as a whole in the third quarter, our same-store NOI growth was positive, .0.9% GAAP and 4.3% cash. Across our portfolio, we leave 604,000 square feet in the quarter at mark-to-markets of 20.6% GAAP and 13% cash. We have the right assets in the right sub markets or with significant embedded value and well-positioned developments and redevelopment opportunities. Now back to Steve.","Steven Roth","Thanks, David. We are delighted to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thank you and good morning. Steve, I want to go back to your -- one of your initial comments which was robust demand across many industries across many submarkets, you know there is clearly concerns of things flowing out there. I just wanted to get your thoughts on kind of where you think you know how it feels and where we are in the cycle and any concerns you do have about where we might be in the real estate cycle?","Steven Roth","Jamie, hi, good morning. First of all, we're always concerned. We live our life by being concerned. That's part of the job. I'll give you a quick overview and turn it over to David for more detail. What we're seeing is that in the better buildings in the better submarkets, there is robust demand, and in fact even increasing rents. If you are not in the right submarkets, or if you have tired buildings, you are seeing a totally different New York, but the New York that we operate in looks very robust to us.","David, what do you think?","David Greenbaum","Jamie, I'll give you one statistic that I find interesting, and that is year-to-date in New York we have leased little less than 1.4 million square feet, 1.347 million. Of that, 600 plus thousand square feet was all growth by existing tenants; it's Facebook, it's NYU Langone, it's HomeAdvisor, it's AlixPartners. So we are still seeing tenants increasing their footprints, looking for more space. As I was coming upstairs for this call, I heard Glen and one of his leasing guys, talking about the actions that they've got in terms of proposals that we're working on for our building. So I will tell you generally the environment for good buildings, well-located, as I mentioned, one of the major themes is renovated buildings and well-located buildings in the right districts, we've got a lot of action.","Steven Roth","Jamie, I'll add to that and say this, we are very, very attentive to a change in the demographic trends that have made New York so great. So the essential part of New York is it's an enormous infrastructure of talent, headquarters, business, arts, restaurants et cetera. I would be remiss, if I don't mention theater because that's my family business. And the inflow of talent into New York continues unabated and we watch it very carefully. People want to be in New York, they want to be in the right spot. And so, we think that New York continues to have an enormous future. And we watch it very carefully.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Thank you. And then just a follow-up for me, you talked about being in the right submarkets, can you talk about the decision to increase your ownership of the Farley building? And then as you think about One Penn, Two Penn, just any early conversations with tenants in terms of interest in the renovated space, I guess especially at Two Penn and what they might be looking for?","Steven Roth","Yes, we love Farley. We think Farley is an extraordinary property. We learned a lesson. Last summer, we went out to Silicon Valley to call on our customers, and we're talking about the Facebooks and the Googles and the big boys. They have out in the valley their preferences; they have campuses which are horizontal, not vertical. So what we have in Farley is a horizontal campus. It's a double-wide block. It's the largest footprint in town. It's right on -- you know it's adjacent to the train station. We think that we are in the midst of creating a very, very, very exciting project. We love it. And naturally we want to own it as much as we can, and so, we so we saw eye to eye with our friends and our partners that related and we will be announcing later on today that we're increasing our ownership. So there's that. What was the second half of your question, sir?","Jamie Feldman","Just tenant demand for some of the -- you talked you're going to lay out plans for the Two Penn renovation, I'm just -- what kind of discussions you're having with tenants that might be interested in that space or the Farley building space?","Steven Roth","We have tenants who want to talk to us about those properties. The tenants who are in the neighborhood, the tenants who are in the buildings now are very interested in perpetuating their occupancy, and we have outsiders. Everybody that we have shown our plan to -- in the brokerage marketplace is beyond excited. It's transformative. It's a very exciting prospect of what we're doing. Quite frankly, we are holding off a little bit. Okay? Because we're -- this is not the right time for us to go to lease. So the answer is we are confident in demand, we have gotten enormous support from the real estate community, and we couldn't be more optimistic about what we're doing.","David, do you have anything to add?","David Greenbaum","Jamie, this is -- I'd just one other quick thought and that is Glen, I, and Tom is leasing guys are just beginning to introduce what we're doing in the Penn district to the marketplace. We are having meetings with the brokerage houses, with the key brokers that we all do business with. As Steve said, an enormous 'wow' to the brokers when they begin to focus on the scale of what we're doing, the transformation of what we're doing. Everybody recognizes that Seventh Avenue, the Penn District will be the epicenter of the new New York as we look out five and 10 years from now. It is at the busiest transportation hub of North America. And I will tell you the packages that we are doing in the building in terms of the amenity packages for the tenants, we think we will be doing something that will be truly transformative, and the brokers understand we really deliver on everything that we say we're going to do. So it's really very early days to talk about any specific tenants or space.","Steven Roth","We're also excited about posting on our Web site a handful of images of what we're doing, so that when you take a look at those, you can get a feel for our level of, for why we are so enthusiastic about what we're doing. Thanks.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Good morning. Steve, in your opening comments, you really didn't talk about sort of return of capital or how you may use kind of the growing cash balance that you've currently got plus the money coming in from 220 over the next year, can you just sort of speak to that and how you plan to use that and help try and close the NAV discount?","Steven Roth","We are an extremely liquid, well-financed real estate business. We have great financial resources. Those resources are growing and that's by our intent. We look at every single deal that comes along in the marketplace and we have decided that we can't make money at the offering prices of most of the deals so we've been very selective, we're in business to make money for our shareholders. So, rather than just -- we don't follow the policy, well, let's just look at the marketplace and take the best deal that's available because the best deal that's available may not work. So the answer is that we have pushed away in the current part of the cycle. There will be opportunities. The opportunities will be extraordinary and you have to have dry powder to take advantage of those opportunities. So, what I'm really saying is not yet.","In the interim, the cash that we have will be used to pay down debt et cetera. So as an example, we bought for $400 million, I think it was $42 million dollars from host Marriott, the half of the 15:35 Broadway block that we didn't know. We bought that to a cash We now have an asset that has a value of a well over a billion dollars that we own free and clear, no financing on it whatsoever. So if you remember when we put out that press release a couple of months ago that transaction is doubly accretive, it's accretive because of the earnings but it's even more -- it's even because of the rents but it's even more accretive because we used 2% cash to buy it. So the answer to your question is not yet, liquidity is good, we will pay down debt selectively which also increases our liquidity and so there you have it. This is the time of the cycle when it's the right time to be selective in acquisition and to build liquidity.","Steve Sakwa","And just to kind of follow up or buybacks sort are not part of that equation at this point?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is that I think you know my feeling about buybacks I was very clear about it in my annual letter. If we thought that buybacks would increase shareholder value we would do it. Okay. There's no sign that buybacks other than putting your \u2013tempting to put your finger in the dike creates long-term shareholder value unless they are done by a company that has a recurring cash flow and they're done continuously over long, long periods of time. That doesn't fit our profile. So we'll see. On the other hand\u2026","Steve Sakwa","Can I just ask quickly on the Street retail, I mean you certainly had a more positive\u2026","Steven Roth","Steve, Steve, Steve, hang on for a minute. The other thing is you should know that we are not cavalier about buybacks. We cover it at every board meeting. We discuss it and re-discuss it, so we are not closed minded. We just think that we are practical. We just think that we are -- we are practical. Is your question about street retail?","Steve Sakwa","Sorry, I just wanted to circle up, you know your commentary was a bit more positive this quarter than last quarter, certainly raising the number from 304 to 315, I guess I'm just trying to find out was that largely due to the old navy deal or sort of getting completed and that risk being taken off the table I'm just trying to gauge kind of where your temperature is on street retail today versus say a three months ago?","Steven Roth","I'd love to call a bottom but maybe I'm not that smart or maybe I'm not that stupid. The street retail business continues to be soft. Our business continues to be strong because of very strong leases in place and the best properties of the business. And all that we're saying is that the cautious numbers that we put out $309 million that reduced to $304 million because of a reclassification of I think it was 770 Broadway retail. That number we are going to see that number and I just wanted to make sure that you and all your colleagues knew that as soon as we did. So, and we think the number in 2019 will be even a little bit better, okay. But the tone in retail continues to be bottom fishing and caution.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thanks very much.","Steven Roth","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman from Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Just a couple of quick questions, Steve, I assume related shares your enthusiasm about the demand and the prospects given how successful Hudson Yards has been. So what gives them the desire to want to sell additional interest to you and maybe just talk a little bit about the math surrounding your purchase, I don't know if it was an option that you called or whether it was a negotiation?","Steven Roth","So, I lovingly called you Mr. Yada, Yada, Yada, this morning. You get it. You get my name.","Michael Bilerman","I got it.","Steven Roth","Okay. So look related love the asset and the neighborhood as well as we do, but they're in a different business, okay, they're in a business where basically they invest, they have third party capital and they're in it for a profit. What we did was we -- they sold us for the money. So we paid them and what we thought was an appropriate uptick from our bases to make them happy to sell and make us very happy to buy. So it's very simple. They're in a different business model than we are. They're in the business to create assets, create value, and then harvest that value. We're in the same business but we're a much longer term than they are. So they love the asset, we love the asset, and off we go, we put out a press release at the -- and to close of business today.","Michael Bilerman","And then just thinking about the cash it's going to be coming in over the next couple of years and congratulations on starting the sales process, the official closing for 220. How should we think about both the cash that comes in from 220 against the loan that you had for the construction costs. I don't know if it has to be paid down initially versus taking the cash? And then secondly how we should think about the billion dollars of non-core sales, what is the current process that's on place there and how should we think about that cash coming in?","Steven Roth","Michael, that's a very good question. With respect to we used the $750 million term loan we use the $750 million term loan to partially finance the development of 220 Central Park South which as I think, you and everybody is beginning to see is one hell of a Budian [ph] deal. As the closings of that -- as we climb up the building and we close apartments, that will liquidate that investment or that will liquidate the loan. We will use the proceeds to roll into financing Moynihan, okay? So, as you can see that term loan is 100 basis points over LIBOR, which is it gives us the lowest, it gives us the lowest cost of capital in the universe. And so, that cost of capital which benefit our -- benefit [technical difficulty] we will now be rolled into Moynihan.","With respect to the other half of your question, I would refer you to exactly what I said to Steve Sakwa a couple of seconds, a couple of minutes ago.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. And then in terms of the Yada, Yada, Yada, is there any update on sort of everything being on the table and anything on strategic alternatives in terms of spinning off street retail, contributing assets to a fund, is there anything new on that front?","Steven Roth","Michael, we think we've done more than anybody else over the recent years to create value and to focus our company. I would just call into the attention that our Washington's -- our Washington, I call them \"Spin Child.\" So it's a spin off which we think is - we continue to take as the child of ours. JBG Smith, which is performing very well, so we're actually pretty excited of what we have done. We are still - they are still on the table, other kinds of structuring restructuring which will create shareholder value, okay. We will have more to say about that. We have nothing to say about it today. ","Michael Bilerman","Okay. Great. Thanks for your time.","Steven Roth","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Kim","Thank you. On 220 Central Park South, you spent a lot of capital time and effort on the building, even earn potentially a billion dollars in cash profit which is about a year-and-a-half of FFO. But from a reported earnings perspective, it's going to basically shelf at zero, I think. And in fact, it's actually been an earnings drag over the last few years. I realize it's in your NAVs and all our NAVs but I am questioning if that's the correct way to figure earnings given it is cash profit?","Steven Roth","I think I am a little startled. I think that your question implies that maybe we shouldn't have done 220 and sacrificed that billion dollars. But with respect to the accounting details of your question, I want to turn it over to Joe. ","Joseph Macnow","Hey, John, it's Joe. How are you? John, the profit on 220 will fall through FFO on it's non-depreciable real estate and accordingly under the NARIET definition of FFO, the gains on the sale of that land parcel is now fully developed, will show up in FFO. We're going to treat it as not part of recurring FFO but only as part of FFO as adjusted because it's not recurring but there will be a billion dollars of income flowing through the income statement and a billion dollars of cash generated. As Steve said that was after paying off the $750 million. It was also after paying of the $950 million first mortgage. That's a $1.7 billion of debt. You can do the math to understand what the gross proceeds are.","Steven Roth","I think John, your question implies that it is a one - and I'll say, it is a one-timer, there's no doubt. And there is, it's possible in fact maybe even likely that at one-timer, even a massive one-timer like this gets no credit in our trading price of our stock. If that's the case, so be it. But we will benefit by having a very significant increase in our cash at the end of this - at the end of this project.","John Kim","I just wanted to clarify, it will be included in NAREIT FFO, but when you do FFO as adjusted, will you be taking it out, so therefore it's more of a normalized figure without CPS?","Steven Roth","No, the opposite will be as part, yes, exactly what you said, it's part of NAREIT FFO but FFO as adjusted which in our mind is a recurring type of number we'll exclude it.","John Kim","Okay. So I'm just saying, I think a lot of investors will focus on your reported number, which is the as adjusted so to look like there's no earnings coming from it when in fact, it is hugely profitable?","Joseph Macnow","Well, I think that a number of the people on this call focus on both. The as adjusted because that's the number that gets reported bottom line but as well as the recurring number which won't include it, it will include it rather.","Steven Roth","Yes. John, I give investors a little bit more credit than that. I mean, I think the project is smashingly successful, it creates an enormous amount of value and that will be recognized. I think investors are smarter than maybe we're giving them credit for. ","Joseph Macnow","The bottom line is in our NAV, we have a $1 billion for value creation from that asset. That's the right way to think of it, shareholders have been rich a $1 billion, $5 a share.","Steven Roth","Okay.","John Kim","Okay. On your dispositions of your commercial assets, you recorded a $141 million net gain which is a GAAP figure. I'm wondering if you could disclose what the cash gain was on that.","Steven Roth","Joe, that's yours.","Joseph Macnow","I'm sorry I didn't understand the question. [Technical Difficulty] Can you repeat it once?","John Kim","The asset sales that you had during the quarter you had recorded a $141 million of gain which is a GAAP figure. I think you also disclosed what the taxable figure was but I just wondering what the cash figure was that you have.","Joseph Macnow","The cash figure was $120 million on the sale of the building, $7 million coming from the collection of our share of the mortgage in excess of our basis on the mortgage.","John Kim","Was there 00:47:51 lasted in that?","Joseph Macnow","Yes, there was but tiny really tiny. That's the lion share of the gains.","John Kim","So the answer is that the cash is directionally the same as the GAAP. ","Joseph Macnow","Right. Exactly right.","John Kim","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Steven Roth","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks for taking the question. So just on the Street retail numbers coming in better than you originally anticipated. Can you kind of maybe walk us through what may have surprised to the upside. I know in your original number you didn't bake in any renewal from expiration. So did you see - did you see you know better trends in terms of renewing or is there something specific about any of the assets? ","Steven Roth","I can tell you I'm surrounded by seven accounting geniuses so one of you geniuses will have to handle that one.","Joseph Macnow","Well, first of all, there was a discussion of a tax abatement and a piece of that being nonrecurring in Steve's remarks a piece of it was recurring. We didn't count on that in the $304 million. And as we always do when we project something we take the worst case basis. To the past two quarters, we've been saying that the 304 seem low, Steve said, it's even stronger in the last quarter. But the individual IMs that make it up are basically conservative -- very conservative in the 304. And some things went our way. We didn't have credit losses that we anticipated and a few other things like that. ","Steven Roth","The difference between 304 and 315 is, it's a couple of percentage points. So these are small movements. We will offline, do a reconciliation, and get a hold of you.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. Can I just specifically ask about any update on Massimo Dutti and the three asset -- the three expirations at Madison that I believe were expiring this quarter?","Steven Roth","All of those will go empty before we fill. So they will have a period where they will be vacant.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay.","Steven Roth","And that's in our projections.","Vikram Malhotra","So the three assets and the three stores at Madison with -- were they expiring this third quarter or they will expire in the fourth quarter?","Steven Roth","The expiration of six -- when is the expiration.","Vikram Malhotra","The Westbury.","Steven Roth","Oh, the Westbury, when is the Westbury expiration? We are doing a couple of short-term renewals for a couple of the tenants at the Westbury, which will take those expirations out to the early part of next year.","Vikram Malhotra","Oh, God, Okay. That helps. And then just last question\u2026","Steven Roth","On the Westbury which is a pretty interesting exciting asset when the building, when the tenants move out, we are going to renovate the building, we're going to clean the fa\u00e7ade, we get a lighted landscape and we're going to make improvements to it and then go out and remarket the property. ","Vikram Malhotra","Got it, okay. And then just last question given sort of potential redevelop of future assets and the moving parts that been, maybe Steve, if you could give us just thoughts around the WeWork model, may be creating a bigger partnership with WeWork at any of the assets. Would they fit into any of the bigger plans?","Steven Roth","The answer is yes, and yes.","Vikram Malhotra","And any -- just, I can term those types of assets or any thoughts on like size-wise or what would you consider assets in terms of good partnership with them?","Steven Roth","I really can't get into any detail. We are - we talked to WeWork. They're friends of ours. We think that they have a very interesting business model and we aspire to do business with them. With respect to talking about specific assets, I think that's inappropriate. ","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead. ","John Guinee","Great. First for Steve, I'm not going to ask you how much it costs to bring Jerry Seinfeld to California because that's such a cool event. But any thoughts on the mid-terms next week and is New York City still involved in Amazon HQ too, I can't recall?","Steven Roth"," With respect to Jerry Seinfeld, we own, what we think is a - it's the best feel in California. We think NAV comes to California One, certainly has thus it seems like that -- is something like that -- hard. We really want to celebrate this great asset by inviting the real estate community and to tour it, paste it, walk around and just feel it. And so that they can appreciate that if we can - they can appreciate the assets the way we do. So we just thought that Jerry Seinfeld who we know has done some things for 00:53:47 would be a draw. So what we're really doing is, we're incentivizing the real estate community to come see our asset that comes to each area at the same time. So we think, its valuable dollar spent. And are you coming or not? I don't remember.","John Guinee","We're conflicted with you much as we'd love to. How about the midterm to have at Amazon HQ2?","Steven Roth","Okay. Well, to my knowledge, I don't know anything about HQ2 more than anybody else but to my knowledge, the activity level between HQ2 and the New York city is not high. With respect to the midterms, I have nothing whatsoever to say.","John Guinee","Okay. And then, David just a big picture Penn Plaza One, Penn Plaza Two, Farley the Long Island Railroad concourse, the 33rd Street Plaza. When should that be completely finished buttoned up all the construction done. Look - look 100% complete, is that 2023, 2026 what's timeframe just so we can get our arms around?","David Greenbaum","Penn One, as we told you is starting now and we've told you that that's a project that's probably around the two-year project. The Long Island Railroad at concourse realistically, we think that is, we're likely that we could share at some time in the next 12 months or 18 months and also is manageable in terms of the duration. I think the outside date for what you're talking about realistically is the total redevelopment of Penn Two. It's a massive job that as I indicated in my remarks is going to require us to vacate the lower 10 floors of the building. The major tenant, as we've said in the past in that building where lease comes up in the April of 2020. So realistically that project will commence sometime in the early part of 2020. It will be a project scope of somewhere and 00:56:08 we're really in the process right now of finalizing costs and timing of that project. But realistically, it's a project that will take 24 months to 30 months.","Steven Roth","So John I would give you another, another cut on that answer. I think that in 2021, there will be so much activity and so much construction going on in the Penn district that everybody will be begin to, will understand for sure exactly what we're doing and exactly the values we are creating. ","John Guinee","And then when does Hotel Pennsylvania kick-in and how about Manhattan Mall? ","Steven Roth","What was the part of the question?","John Guinee","When does Penn and Manhattan Mall kick-in?","Steven Roth","Manhattan Mall is a parking lot, is a holding action for expansion. So that's going to be the last thing to happen. The Hotel Pennsylvania has been through different cycles of opportunities which have not yet panned out. So that is also inventory. We expect that the value of with the Hotel Pennsylvania land will increase geometrically as we get moving on what's going on across the street.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you very much.","Steven Roth","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Santos from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Alex Goldfarb","Hey, good morning. It's actually Alex Goldfarb on for Dan. So just two questions for you, the first one is as we look at 2019, last year you guys provided some thoughts on things that we should look for as far as either NOI moving in or out or one-timers. Is there anything that you can provide as we think about 2019? I don't know if it's maybe recapturing the Kmarts or anything that could be impacting our numbers that we may not see just by looking at the financials based on lease roll or some of that maybe swap or burn off et cetera? ","Steven Roth","Alex, as you know, we don't get guidance and so I can't really, it's not appropriate to answer that question. And Joe, do you have anything to add?","Joseph Macnow","No, if Alex is asking or there are things like recapturing the portion of the Kmart at 770, we're not prepare to stay if they're are going to be in 2019. Somehow is company always finds one of these hidden jewels, to capitalize on.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay. That's helpful. And then the second question is for Steve, in the recent local press in New York, there has been some conversation about commercial rent control and New York City Council has been debating it. Do you have any views on the potential that this could become enacted in some way shape or form or your view is that enough of the key people in New York understand the ramifications of this and therefore it won't pass the way it hasn't for the 30 years that's been discussed?","Steven Roth","Well, this is not a new idea and as you said it has not - that has not passed muster for decades and decades. But I'm very sympathetic to political leadership being sensitive to empty storefronts and what have you know that's a level that I'm unbelievably sympathetic. The idea of is it really, really it's not a valid idea; the concept that landlords are to blame for the empty storefronts because the rents are too high. That doesn't hold the water. Now there's lots of different things that are going on in the retail business especially affect the local kinds of tenants that the political leadership are focusing on. The increase in the minimum wage has had a very, very, very serious effect on profitability.","Restaurants can't make it a center. That's a very huge cost to them, increase in real estate taxes is a huge cost, the decline in their margins the pressure of the of the trend in retailing towards Amazon and that is an enormous number of headwinds affecting these smaller the smaller local businesses. Now that rent is not one and the reason I say the rent is not one because the landlords aren't totally stupid. Our business is keeping, keeping the income coming in and keeping our spaces full. So you can be sure that universally across the city at all properties, the rents will go to the clearing price to fill up the space, so that will happen because market dynamics not because of a misguided piece of legislation. I would remind you that we're on the same side because the most important drivers of the financial health of the city are individual income taxes and property tax, so that's what I think. I think I'm sensitive to the issue. And I think getting these stores for reoccupied is important for the health of the city, but I think this legislation is misguided.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you, Steve.","Steven Roth","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. ","Nicholas Yulico","Okay. Thank you. So going back to this $315 million of NOI now expected in retail, how do we square that up with page 12 of the supplemental, which shows you have you know $244 million for the first nine months of this year, which would imply something like $70 million in the fourth quarter, which is down from the $85 million in the third quarter, is there what's kind of driving that down in the fourth quarter or am I missing something?","Steven Roth","Joe I hope is going to answer that, Nick.","Joseph Macnow","Nick, because that requires a little reconciliation on our part. I think I'd prefer to do that offline with you after the meeting.","Nicholas Yulico","No problem. Appreciate it. And then just second\u2026","Joseph Macnow","I will tell you we\u2026","Nicholas Yulico","Okay. Appreciate it. Just one other question is, how should we think about interest expenses? You are heading into next year. You have some capitalized interest benefit that probably goes away, I assume as the condos are sold and removed from construction in progress and at the same time you're paying off debt so just trying to get a feel for how, some of the moving parts on interest expense for next year? Thanks.","Joseph Macnow","I would not expect capitalizing shares to go down in 2019 versus 2018. We're still at the tail end of the expenditures for 2020. Other projects are further along. I would remind you that the interest expense you saw in the past coming from the capital lease is 1535 Broadway, which was like $12 million a year. That will disappear as a result of the acquisition.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay. Thank you everyone.","Operator","Thank you. We're showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Steven Roth for closing comments.","Steven Roth","Thank you very much. We're very pleased with this quarter. We look forward to seeing you on the fourth quarter earnings call, which is scheduled for Tuesday, February 12, 2019, and we look forward to seeing many of you at Montgomery, San Francisco next week. Thank you very much. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Our speakers will address your questions at the end of the presentation during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Cathy Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust's fourth quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our fourth quarter earnings release and filed our annual report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents as well as our supplemental financial information package are available on our Web site, www.vno.com under the Investor Relations section. In these documents and during today's call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Division and Steven Theriot, Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room are Michael Franco, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer; and Joseph Macnow, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's fourth quarter call. I am eager to chat with you this morning about Vornado's performance and about the markets and the world in general. Our prepared remarks have been long, but be assured we will leave plenty of time for Q&A.","Yesterday we reported very strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our fourth quarter comparable FFO was $1.27 per share, 10.4% better than the fourth quarter of 2014. Our full year comparable FFO was $4.83 per share, 10.5% better than 2014. If we were to exclude our real-estate fund the increase over 2014 would have been 16.3%. Our earnings growth was driven by our flagship New York business and as David will cover shortly our New York business will continue to produce strong growth in 2016.","Companywide in 2015 we leased 5.381 million square feet and 483 transactions with overall positive mark-to-markets of 14% GAAP and 12% cash. In New York we leased 2.276 million square feet for the year and 610,000 square feet for the fourth quarter at positive GAAP mark-to-markets of 22.8% for the year and an even higher 25.7% for the fourth quarter. These are great numbers. Mitchell and David will give you details of their businesses shortly.","Washington is now a tale of slow recovery being dragged down by Skyline. With respect to Penn Plaza we are delighted that Governor Cuomo has shined a bright light on the importance of Penn Station as New York City's busiest transportation hub and the crying need for improvement. Vornado will be a full participant in this process.","The Penn Plaza district where we are the dominant owner with 9 million square feet is a great opportunity for us. We are knee deep in planning multiple projects to transform and enhance our vast Penn Plaza holdings. We are the industry leader in capital programs that reposition and upgrade office and retail assets so as to achieve their full potential. As David will tell you next up is our grand plan to upgrade, modernize and transform One Penn Plaza and Two Penn Plaza into an integrated 4.2 million square foot complex sitting directly on top of Penn Station in the center of what has become New York's new west side. The goal here is to achieve market rents as much as 50% higher than today's rents.","Almost a year ago in my letter to shareholders and in each of our last three quarterly calls I stated that, the easy money has been made for the cycle, asset prices are high, well past the 2007 peak. It's a better time to sell than to invest and most importantly now is the time in the cycle when the smart guys build cash for opportunities that will undoubtedly present themselves in the future. To be honest I didn't expect to be so right so quickly. With many sectors of the economy decelerating we have experienced a period of high volatility in both the credit markets and the equity markets, this will of course have some effect on the real-estate markets. So, and we have been preparing for all this for whatever is to come. Vornado is buttoned up and ready.","Our New York properties are very well leased. We are basically full. Our income stream is diversified coming from over 1,200 tenants with a weighted average lease term of 8.8 years. Our top-10 tenants account for only 13.2% of revenue. This is a testament of the quality of our assets and our leasing machine that Victoria\u2019s Secret chose in a very competitive makeover to locate their 64,000 square foot Fifth Avenue flagship with us. Same for Facebook, Amazon, Foot Locker, Neuberger Berman and on and on, you get the picture. In this environment cash is king, today we have $4.5 billion of immediate liquidity including $2 billion of cash and marketable securities and our fully undrawn 2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. On top of that we have over 13 billion of highest quality unencumbered properties.","Last year in my annual letter to shareholders on Page 10 if you would like to reread it, I laid out our debt philosophy Vornado enjoys access for the four corners of the capital markets. We preferred secured debt that is recourse solely to a single property rather than unsecured corporate debt that bears the full faith and credit of the issuer sort of like a personal guarantee. It's interesting to note that today secured debt for a sponsor of our standing is both readily available and surprisingly cheaper than the unsecured full faith and credit type debt. The unsecured and CMBS debt markets are getting a little jumpy. Vornado today has only $850 million of unsecured debt in two issues maturing four and seven years out.","Vornado is focused and simplified and ready for battle, having sold, spun and approved over $8.7 billion of assets. True to our word we have sold much more than we have acquired. Acquisitions have been limited to strategic New York retail properties and created a class of value-added office projects. We have pushed away from acquisitions which were off the fair way, non-strategic or most importantly overpriced. Importantly we have also significantly upgraded the mix and quality of our assets for example trading 1740 Broadway of B-office building for the St. Regis retail, 866 UN Plaza for 655 Fifth Avenue Retail of Ferragamo Store, the Green Acres B plus Mall for the retail block at 666 Fifth Avenue and 1750 Pennsylvania avenue for Old Baby on 34th Street. Three years ago while anticipating secular change note the current softness in retail and recognizing that with only a handful of malls we were in no man's land, we decided to exit all non-Manhattan retail. I believe this decision will look better and better and better as each year goes by.","A word about our shopping center spend, Urban Edge properties celebrating its first anniversary we couldn\u2019t be more delighting with its performance. We created UE by ceding it with our unique high barrier North Eastern shopping center assets and with our management and staff. We recruited Jeff Olson, a best in class CEO and more sticking with a strong balance sheet reported by an experienced and engaged Board. Urban Edge is producing the exact result we had expected and investors the final report got a rewarding UE with their appropriate stock price which by the way has held rock solid in the recent months of clients. And think about it if the UE assets were still bundled inside Vornado, they probably would be valued at a big discount just like Vornado was. Given the success of UE the concept of laser focused smaller entities may well be a template for the future.","Our 220 Central Park South super tall residential condominium tower is also buttoned up. It is now 260 feet vertical and visible from Central Park. It will rise at the rate of 1 floor per week. We have dedicated super low interest rates financing in place sufficient to fund the entire project. We are over 50% on the contract at record setting pricing which covers our cost. We will deliver in 2018 and trust me there will be at least two more up and down cycles before them that is sort of a joke. As assets values have risen over the cycle we have pulled back from making loans especially mezzanine loans. We now have only a couple of small loans left on our books.","Now if I may a few words about the New York real estate markets. We see no real hiccups so far in the class A of this market. Vornado's office business continues to perform at very high levels. We do anticipate that decision makers will take note of the financial volatility and pause slowdown and rethink a little. Of course we are constantly looking over our shoulders, that's our job but business continues to be great so far so good. David and Mitchell will discuss the health of their markets with you in a moment.","My personal favorite as David would tell you is that a full 25% of Vornado's New York leasing in 2015 was at rents over $100 per foot, pretty amazing. I was going to say and they move over more but my team wouldn\u2019t let me say this so I didn\u2019t say it. Nationwide retail sales were soft and shopping center traffic has been declining quarter-over-quarter. In Manhattan as I've said before momentum and investors have driven retail asset prices too high, landlord asking rents are also too high exceeding retailer's willingness and ability to pay. Trust me we are the biggest player in this market by far and we are in the business of being realistic in terms of pricing and making deals and at all basis we sure tag.","Hotels are soft just look at the hotel stocks which are off one third to one half in my mind the New York hotel industry is the victim of gross cyclical over supply even more than the impact of the strong U.S. dollar. New York has added 25,000 rooms in 2010 to a base of 82,000 rooms and with 18,000 more rooms under construction too much supply. And then of course there is Airbnb sort of like what e-shopping is to brick and mortar retailer. Interestingly while people say that the strong dollar is causing a decline in tourism the numbers show that both domestic and international tourism are holding up just fine.","Vornado has a very limited exposure to the hotel market recently the Hotel Pennsylvania, which is really a parking lot. The for sale condo business has dramatically slowed at all price points and in all neighborhoods. It's easy to blame the volatility we are now seeing on the financial markets for the buyer's floors, but the slowdown actually started six months ago. There seems to be a condo project on every block most things developed by undercapitalized over leveraged players. Vornado's sole exposure to the condo business is on 220 Central Park South Project, which is in a class by itself.","A word about the credit markets which are becoming a tail of the haves and the have not's. For sponsors such as Vornado the credit markets are open at historically low rates. On the other side of the spectrum for risk assets and less established sponsors the credit markets are cloned and choppy. Here is an example I would like to share with you. Last week we closed a $700 million five year floating rate loan on 770 Broadway at LIBOR plus 175, which we swapped to fix at 2.56% I think 2.56% fixed for what is actually a 4.5 years swap on a $700 million loan is a truly spectacular rate, and by the way just for reference that rate is a full 59 basis points better than the rate -- on a similar loan we closed just two months ago.","It's too early to tell what affect the recent volatility in the financial markets will have on leasing or on asset valuation. My guess is not all that much. We have been long overdue for a correction and after all a swoon in economic activity and volatility in the debt and equity markets seems a sure recipe for a continued easy money and low interest rates.","I'll conclude with a listing of our priorities, what we are focusing on and what are truly important in our business. One buttoning up and focusing on being strong and ready both financially and in every other way. And by the way we are beginning to see a few interesting opportunities. Two, recognizing the full potential of our vast Penn Plaza assets, actually Penn Plaza is a city within a city. And three, closing the gap been our stock price and the true value of our Company, by the way Green Street's NAV for Vornado is a $125 this year.","Thank you for listening, I will now turn it over to Steve Theriot to cover our financial results.","Steven Theriot","Thank you, Steve. Yesterday we reported fourth quarter comparable FFO of $1.27 per share, up from $1.15 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter, a very strong 10.4% increase. Our full year comparable FFO was $4.83 per share, up from $4.37 per share last year. Also a very strong 10.5% increase. The increase in our comparable FFO in 2015 versus the prior year was clouded by lower gains in 2015 from asset sales and mark-to-market fair value adjustments of our real-estate fund. Excluding this effect our comparable FFO for the year would have increased 13 -- I'm sorry 16.3%. Nor surprisingly our growth comes from our large and strong New York business.","Total FFO for the fourth quarter was $1.37 per share compared to $1.22 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter. Total FFO for the full year was $5.48 per share compared to $4.83 per share for the prior year. Non-comparable FFO items aggregated 19.4 million of income for the fourth quarter compared to 13 million of income for the fourth quarter of last year. 2015 non-comparable items aggregated 123.7 million of income, consisting primarily of a $90 million reversal of an allowance on deferred tax assets of our taxable REIT subsidiaries and 46.4 million of FFO from the operations of 20 Broad and 750 Pennsylvania Avenue which we sold. Please see our press release or the overview on MD&A on Pages 37 and 38 of our annual report on Form 10-K for a detailed summary of non-comparable items.","Fourth quarter comparable EBITDA was 400.7 million ahead of last year's fourth quarter by 9.6%. Our full year comparable EBITDA was 1.533 billion ahead of last year by 5.9%. Excluding the effect of our real-estate fund our full year comparable EBITDA increased by 8.9%. Our New York business produced 283.5 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter ahead of last year's fourth quarter by a strong 29.2 million or 11.5%. Comparable EBITDA for the New York business was 1.079 billion for the year or 12.2% ahead of 2014. The increases in comparable EBITDA for the quarter and the year were driven by redeveloped properties coming back into service primarily 7 West 34th, 330 West 34th Street and the Marriott Marquis retail space at 1535 Broadway and acquisitions primarily the St. Regis retail, 150 West 34th Street and the Center Building in Long Island City.","Our New York same-store results are historically industry leading and we expect to have same-store growth well over 5% in 2016, sequentially higher in the second half than in the first half. When thinking about our earnings in 2016, please keep in mind that we recognized 28 million of one-time income in 2015 from the acceleration of FAS 141 below market leases related to the early termination of the leases at the St. Regis retail property and the Crate and Barrel, lease at 1650 Madison. While this income is included in our 2015 comparable results, it is not included in our 2015 same-store results.","Our Washington business produced 79.3 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, flat to last year's fourth quarter. For the year Washington's comparable EBITDA was 3.5 million behind last year on target with our updated guidance. With respect to 2016 we expect that Washington's comparable EBITDA will be approximately 7 million to 11 million lower than 2015 comprised of our whole Washington business being flat to 4 million higher offset by occupancy of our Skyline properties declining further, decreasing EBITDA by approximately 6.5 million and 1726 M and 1150 17th Street being taken out of service to prepare for the development in the future of a new Class A Trophy office building decreasing EBITDA by approximately 4.5 million.","Now turning to capital markets, in November we completed an unsecured delayed draw of term loan facility in the maximum amount of 750 million. The facility is separate and in addition to our 2.5 billion of revolving credit facilities it will be used for the specific purpose of funding the construction of our 220 Central Park South luxury condo tower. This facility matures in October 2018 with two one year extension options to [indiscernible]. The interest rate is a tight LIBOR plus 115 basis points with a fee of 20 basis points per annum on the unused portion. At closing we drew 187.5 million. This facility together would be in place 950 million loan, provides funding for all of the costs of the development of 220 Central Park South.","In December we completed 450 million financing of the St. Regis retail located on Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street. The loan matures in December 2020 with two one year extension options. The loan is interest only and LIBOR plus 1.8% for the first three years, LIBOR plus 1.9% for years four and five and LIBOR plus 2% during the extension periods. In December we completed 375 million refinancing of 888 Seventh Avenue an 882,000 square foot Manhattan office building. The five year loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.6% which will swap for the term of loan to a fixed rate of 3.15%. We realized net proceeds of approximately 49 million after repaying the existing 5.71% $319 million mortgage which was scheduled to mature in January 2016.","Last week we completed 700 million refinancing of 770 Broadway 1,158,000 million square foot Manhattan office building. The five year loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.75% which will swap for 4.5 years to a fixed rate of 2.56%. We realized net proceeds of approximately 330 million. The property was previously encumbered by a 5.65%, $353 million mortgage which was scheduled to mature in March 2016.","Our remaining 2016 consolidated debt maturities are 708.6 million consisting primarily of the 550 million mart loan, which matures in December 2016 and the 115 million Bowen property loan while which matures in June of 2016. We are well along working on these refinancings. Excluding the financing for our 220 Central Park South Project and including the capital market transactions completed in 2016. Our consolidated debt metrics are debt to enterprise value of 34%, debt to EBITDA ratio is 6.2 times, fixed rate debt accounted for 77% of debt with a weighted average rate of 4% and a weighted average term of 5.1 years and floating rate that accounted for 23% of debt with the weighted average interest rate of 2.0% and the weighted average term of 5.8 years.","Our share of 2016 debt maturities are partially owned entities are 736.4 million consisting primarily of 361 million at 280 Park Avenue, 161 million at the Warner Building and 138 million at One Park Avenue. We are also well along on working on these refinancings. Including our share of partially owned entities debt, excluding ToyotaRus our total debt to EBITDA ratio goes to 7.5 times from 6.2 times for our consolidated debt. Okay, as we disclosed a note 2 to our financial statements we recognized onetime tax deductions related to the implementation of a tangible property regulations issued by the internal revenue service. These deductions and gains from sales transactions resulted in 100% of our 2015 common dividend being classified as long-term capital gains.","In closing Vornado has a fortress balance sheet, our leverage is modest and our maturities are well staggered, the vast majority of our debt is conservatively sized property level secured mortgages. We have a very high quality portfolio of unencumbered properties. We have as of today 4.5 billion of liquidity comprised of 2 billion of cash restricted cash and marketable securities and 2.5 undrawn under our 2.5 billion revolving credit facility.","I will now turn the call over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business.","David Greenbaum","Steve, thank you and good morning to everyone. Before I jump into a review of our business for 2015, I want to step back and spend a few minutes talking about market conditions. It's really to give you some perspective on where we see the real estate market in New York. In a nutshell I would say that business has been and remains good. Overall leasing activity in Manhattan in 2015 was strong. 28.2 million square feet transacted the third highest in a decade. At a 9.4% availability rate in Manhattan the rate was 80 basis points lower at yearend 2015 than 2014.","In 2015, 4.5 million square feet of space was absorbed in Manhattan with midtown accounting for some 75% of the positive absorption 3.3 million square feet. We are now six plus years into this growth cycle with availability rates having come down by over 340 basis points from 12.8% to the current 9.4% and during that time period it was a total absorption of more than 20 million square feet of space in the market.","Absorption and employment of course are directly linked. New York has been an amazing magnet for job growth. From the trough in 2009 August, through year-end 2015 private sector employment in New York has gained over 600,000 jobs over four times the number of jobs lost in the recession and is now at an all time record high. In our business of course we focus more closely on New York City's office using employment number which also has continued to expand gaining 31,000 jobs in 2015. Since office using employment bottomed in 2009 New York City has added over 200,000 office using jobs double the number of jobs lost and again is at an all time high.","While the City's office of management and budget is projecting a lower rate of job growth in 2016 of about 60,000 private sector jobs that still represents a very healthy growth rate of 1.7%. The City now has a highly diversified local economy with TAMI tenancies; technology, advertising, media and information as well as the FIRE sector, financial, insurance and real-estate both driving its strong job growth. As Steve would say we are no longer a one trick financial services pony in New York.","Let me now turn to our own portfolio. In 2015 in our New York office portfolio we completed 2.3 million of square feet of leasing activity in 165 transactions with a very diverse mix of high quality tenants across many business sectors. We achieved our highest ever average starting rents of just under $79 per square foot with very strong positive mark-to-markets of 22.8% GAAP and 19.1% cash. Importantly, 32% of our 2.3 million square feet of leasing some 750,000 square feet represented tenants new to New York or expanding in New York, real expansion, real growth, let me give you some of the names, IPG, the Inter Public Group of companies; Facebook, AOL, United Talent Agency, PJT Partners, FactSet, TPG, Foot Locker, Parsons Brinkerhoff and GIC, the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation.","As many of the brokerage firms have noted in 2015 the FIRE sector reemerged as the top driver of leasing with nearly a third of overall activity. That moved back to finance and the boutique asset management and private equity firms has had a notable impact at the high-end of the marketplace. In $100 plus per square foot marketplace, citywide in 2015 138 leases were executed. We completed 28 of those leases, a 20% market share for a total as Steve had mentioned of 544,000 square feet which was 25% of our total leasing activity. Think about it, with less than a 5% market share we did 20% of the triple-digit deals in the market and more than any other landlord spread in six of our Trophy buildings. 650 Madison Avenue, 888 Seventh Avenue, 350 Park Avenue, 280 Park Avenue, 640 Fifth Avenue and 770 Broadway, all at average starting rents of $108 per square foot, this certainly speaks to the quality of our assets.","I might also add that while historically the $100 plus per square foot marketplace had been limited to small space users, last year we completed two of the four largest triple digit leases in the city, one with a private equity firm at 888 Seventh Avenue for 93,000 square feet and the other with a tech company at 770 Broadway for 80,000 square feet.","Let me now quickly turn to the fourth quarter. We completed over 600,000 square feet of leases in the fourth quarter at average starting rents of $75 per square foot and positive mark-to-markets of 25.7% GAAP and 22.4% cash. Our year-end occupancy was 96.3%, we remain basically full.","A couple of highlights for the quarter, in Penn Plaza at our recently redeveloped 330 West 34th Street, we completed an 82,000 square foot lease with Structure Tone which will join this building\u2019s diverse tenant roster of Foot Locker, Deutsche Advertising, Yodle and New York and Company. With this deal the building is now 90% leased up. We actually moved Structure Tone, our tenant at 770 Broadway to 330 West 34 Street to free up to lease an additional floor in 770 Broadway to AOL which is now owned by Verizon and in a growth mode. AOL now occupies a total of 308,000 square feet in 770 Broadway. At our 100 West 33rd street the office portion of the Manhattan mall we took back a floor from Rocket Fuel which was looking to downsize and immediately leased the space to IPG which now occupies a total of 607,000 square feet in the building through its add groups, media brands, FCB and initiatives. We also entered into important renewal leases with Fidelity Investments at 645th Avenue for 41,000 square feet and a law firm at 930 Avenue for 65,000 square feet and finally a renewal expansion with United Talent Agency at 888 Seventh Avenue for 43,000 square feet.","Our activity at the start of 2016 remains strong. At 770 just last week, we signed an 80,000 square foot expansion with Facebook, which has now grown to 355,000 square feet at Seventh Ave 70 from its initial occupancy of 98,000 square feet in May, 2013. We have a strong leasing pipeline of 1,350,000 square feet. This includes over 550,000 square feet in active lease documentation and another 800,000 square feet of leases in advance discussions. With a highly diversified multi-end portfolio our lease explorations for the balance of 2016 are a modest 800,000 square feet our normal run rate and as we look out to 2017 and 2018 the explorations around are 1 million square feet a year because no one tenant representing more than 150,000 square feet.","Over the last three years we have completed a string of major building redevelopment path repositioning seven buildings a total of 6.4 million square feet. Our portfolio is in great shape. We transform to both 7 West 34th Street brining in Amazon to lease virtually the entire building and 330 West 34th Street into 1.2 million square feet of creative class space. With its full block lobby mid block dual box atrium a new curtain wall 280 Park Avenue with JPMorgan Chase is our direct next to a neighbor is now one of the best buildings on Park Avenue attracting best in class boutique financials firms.","At 1290 Avenue of the Americas and at 330 Madison Avenue we executed dramatic building renovations and landed new Burger Berman at 1290 and Guggenheim Partners at 330, as the buildings signature tenant. And we are now in the final stages of completing our program at 90 Park Avenue attracting both traditional financial service firms as well as the creative types.","We would be happy to take you on a tour of our portfolio to showcase both our innovative tenant spaces as well as the dramatic public spaces. Cole Cathy, my development and leasing teams are enormously proud of what we have accomplished and enjoyed showing of our assets. With the completion of these renovation programs you may be asking yourselves so what's next? Of course there is Penn Plaza this is the sub market whose time has now come.","Last month governor Cuomo unveiled an ambitious infrastructure plan for New York State, including array of downstate transportation projects. A new cross-Hudson rail tunnel an addition of a third track to a portion of the Long Island railroad, a train to LaGuardia airport and more it's an impressive array of projects and most importantly as the governor stated Penn Station and I'm now quoting Penn Station will be the nexus for all this increased capacity doubling the traffic through Penn Station over the next 15 years. That is very, very good news for our 9 million square feet of holdings in Penn Plaza.","While our Penn Plaza assets have for the better part of 20 years have been fully leased. Rents remain substantially below what we believe these buildings can achieve given their unmatched access to transportation and their location in the center of Manhattan's new west side. We see a tremendous opportunity to reposition these assets in line with what we have done elsewhere in the city. Consider for a moment just One Penn and Two Penn Plaza two buildings that sit directly on top of and have access to Penn Station without ever stepping outside. These are buildings that represent a significant value creation opportunity.","Our team continues to advance plans to turn these two buildings into a massive 4.2 million square foot Penn Plaza complex fully modernized with shared amenity spaces integrated both above and below ground. When you consider our other development opportunities in the district, it's easy to see why Steve describes Penn Plaza as the Big Kahuna.","For a glimpse into the future of the area be sure to stop in for a bite at the new Penz, it's a food hall we recently created in Two Penn Plaza at the corner of Seventh Avenue and 33rd Street. Spend a few minutes, enjoying the meal and a cocktail or wait until the weather gets a bit warmer and we open up the roll top garage towards onto Plaza 33. As you know last year we implemented a temporary closure of 33rd Street at Seventh Avenue to create a public amenity called Plaza 33. The plaza earned rave reviews from the press, elected officials and the local community. We continue to work with the city and the local community board and are hopeful that Plaza 33 will return later this year as a permanent year round feature. I hope you will stop by.","Another answer to the question of what's next is our growing beach head in the West Chelsea district. At 61 Ninth Avenue, at 15th Street and 512 West 22nd Street right on the high line, we have partnered to develop ground up two new boutique office buildings. Also at 260 Eleventh Avenue we have the opportunity to totally redevelop and expand an asset we acquired in an off market transaction. When you consider where these assets are located and the quality of the architecture you will see that these buildings will be the Trophy assets of the future.","Let me now turn to our important Manhattan Street retail portfolio whereas you know in 2015 we signed the three largest leases in the market, all on Fifth Avenue, a 64,000 square foot flagship with Victoria\u2019s Secret at 640 Fifth Avenue and two leases with Swatch for its luxury brands and for Harry Winston at the St. Regis retail. The aggregate starting rents for these leases are $70 million. Think about it, the rent coming out of these three retail leases [indiscernible] million square foot office building. We delivered possession of the 640 space to Victoria\u2019s Secret on February 1 and both Swatch spaces have now been delivered. Revenue recognition on a GAAP basis has now commenced. In total for the year 2015 we completed 20 retail leases with positive mark-to-markets of 99% GAAP, a two multiple and 149% cash, a two and a half multiple. We had good activity on our remaining spaces at 1535 as well as the 3,200 square foot store we carved out at 640 with 25 feet of frontage.","I'll touch only briefly on the Mart, in River North in Chicago, since I've spent quite a bit of time on the transformation of this iconic asset on our last call. For the year we leased more than 750,000 square feet in 86 transactions including headquarters relocations of ConAgra Foods and Allstate and expansions by PayPal, Yelp and the prominent technology incubator 1871 all at average positive mark-to-markets of 25.3% GAAP and 20.5% cash. This monumental 3.6 million square foot asset is 98.5% leased. We are well into our $40 plus million redevelopment program to add state-of-the-art amenities to the Mart. A grand stair with stadium seating for our tenants to congregate including a presentation venue and bringing new life to the first two floors of the building as well as trend setting food options and a re-imagined food hall. We could not be happier with the performance of this asset.","On to San Francisco, 2015 was a relatively quite leasing year for us in San Francisco where our 1.8 million square foot 555 California Street property is an iconic part of the Skyline. After a very active 2013 and 2014 when we leased over 900,000 square feet at the property in 2015 we leased a total of 98,000 square feet at average starting rents in excess of $83 per square foot and at positive cash mark-to-markets of 34.8%, while the tower at 555 California is fully leased at an occupancy rate of 98.4%. In the fourth quarter Bank of America as expected vacated the old banking hall at 345 Montgomery Street as well as the space it occupied in the adjacent 350 Montgomery Street building, a total of about 2,000 square feet. We are currently prepping the space with exposed brick walls and open planned space for today's creative class of tenants and introduced the space to the marketplace with a broker event in the building just last week. We remain very constructive on the San Francisco market.","Excluding the Hotel Pennsylvania our same-store numbers for the New York business for 2015 were positive 2.4% gap and 1.3% cash and for the fourth quarter the same-store numbers were positive 1.4% gap and negative 4.4% cash. As we have said over the course of the year these numbers are not reflective of the real growth in operating results for the New York division. I want to pause you a minute and talk about the negative same-store numbers for the fourth quarter. This is really important and I want to go over these numbers carefully. In the fourth quarter of 2015 just as our New York office business there was a 10% swing in the difference between our GAAP and our cash same-store numbers. GAAP same-store for new office business was a positive 3.7% and cash same-store was a negative 6.1%, this is an unusual occurrence which is attributable to the free rent periods on the extraordinary amount of leasing that we completed in 2014 some 4.2 million square feet.","Regarding the 2015 GAAP same-store results as I said in our previous calls the tepid growth numbers reflect the dip in occupancy attributable to the redevelopment of 90 Park Avenue as well as the down time in connection with the redevelopment of the retail space at 640 Fifth Avenue for Victoria's Secret and the retail space we took back from Crate and Barrel at 650 Madison Avenue. 2015\u2019s real growth came from placing our added service properties 7 West 34th Street, 330 West 34th Street, 280 Park Avenue and 1535 Broadway back into service which contributed a total of 47 million of EBITDA growth not reflected in our same-store results. And importantly as Steve Theriot said earlier our New York same-store results historically have been industry leading and we fully expect same-store growth in our New York business to be back to well over 5% in 2016.","Let me conclude, it was a strong year in New York for both the market and Vornado and we believe we are well positioned to capture more than our fair share of leasing activity. With a diverse employer base and a large talent pool there is no place where we would rather would be and we are confident that the quality and location of our buildings our team and our relationships in the marketplace will enable us to outperform the marketplace in any environment in the years ahead.","And with that I'll turn the call over to Mitchell to cover Washington.","Mitchell Schear","Thank you, David and good morning everyone. In 2015 the Washington region experienced sustained economic expansion and all economic indicators signaled that the market will continue to strengthen. Job growth more than tripled from 20,800 new jobs in 2014 to over 68,000 new jobs in 2015. Importantly 48% of this growth was in office using sectors with 32,900 new jobs. The passage of the two year federal budget has had a broad stabilizing effect on the local economy and on the ground the green shoots are sprouting a bit we saw pick up in leasing activity and tours throughout 2015. Specifically in our Washington portfolio as we expected our 2015 comparable EBITDA was down about 3.5 million from 2014. As Steve Theriot have said earlier in 2016 we expect EBITDA from our core Washington business will be flat to 4 million higher than 2015. However that growth will be offset by two items.","First we expect the occupancy of our Skyline properties to decline further which will decrease EBITDA by approximately 6.5 million. Second, we will be vacating and taking 1726 M and 1150 17th Street out of service which will decrease EBITDA by approximately 4.5 million. This spring we would demolish these two obsolete buildings in preparation for the development in the future of a new state of the art Trophy Office Building 1700 M in the heart of the central business district. So summing it all up we expect that Washington's 2016 comparable EBITDA will be approximately 7 million to 11 million lower than 2015.","Let me take a minute now to review our 2015 results. In 2015 we leased a lot of space. Over 2.1 million square feet in 2016 deals at initial average cash rent of $40.20 per square foot. About one third of our 2015 leases were new and expanding tenants and the other two-thirds were renewals. We ended the year with office occupancy of 82.1% an increase of 140 basis points over year-end 2014. Skyline sales of 50.1% occupancy by year-end down 340 basis points from 2014 an obvious continuing drag on our overall performance. Without Skyline our office occupancy at year-end was 89.9% an improvement of 250 basis points over 2014. Our Crystal City occupancy at year-end was 89.5% an improvement of 430 basis points over 2014.","On the residential side we own 2,400 apartments in Georgetown and Arlington with a year-end occupancy of 96.1%.","Focusing specifically on the fourth quarter for a moment, we leased 450,000 square feet generating a GAAP mark-to-market of positive 0.7% and a cash mark-to-market of negative 1.7%. Our results we are pleased with given the competition that exists for every lease. Our fourth quarter TIs and leasing commissions were 11.5% of initial rents or $5.06 per square foot per annum trending lower than the prior quarters in 2015.","Now let's turn to specifically the Crystal City and Pentagon City, in 2015 we executed 1.1 million square feet of office leases in Crystal City. Crystal City is starting to gain traction as noted in several local brokerage records. Sale outside of the Crystal City led all other sub markets in the region in net absorption last year, those deals were predominantly done by us. Cushman & Wakefield's recent market presentation referenced Crystal City's comeback and noted that the Crystal City is doing what it takes to win big deals with 1.3 million square feet leased in 2015. Notably in Q4 we executed a 35,000 square foot lease with an insurance company Dominion National at 251 18th Street and at the same building we recently completed a 53,000 square foot lease with Chemonics an international development company. This 3,000 square foot building which was completely vacated by BRAC tenants is now 95% leased.","Also in Crystal City, 2221 South Clark Street another office building previously vacated by defense agencies has just reopened as WeWork's first location in Northern Virginia. In addition to our partnership with WeWork Downtown in our Dupont Circle building we now together converted this building into 216 collaborative living community style apartments as well as two floors of WeWork co-working office space. The office portion opened on February 1st, it looks great and is already 60% occupied. The residential units will be opened in the spring. We are excited to add this important layer to the Crystal City fabric and look forward to welcoming fresh new faces to our community.","Overall we've now resolved or have pending about 74% of the original 2.4 million square feet of space vacated by BRAC tenants. We have 630,000 square feet less to resolve and 412,000 square feet of that is in Skyline. In Crystal City we have taken care of close to 90% or 1.3 million square feet of the original 1.4 million square feet of the BRAC space. We replaced BRAC tenants with a diverse array of associations, professional services and tech innovators steadily changing the complexion and the demographics in Crystal City.","We continue to change the street level experience as well, just last week Sweet Green a local millennial favorite opened its stores on Crystal Drive. Sweet Green, Tailor Gourmet and Earth Treks our new indoor climbing gym are just a few of the new retailers who are bringing a fresh flavor of destination food and activity to Crystal City. We are also changing the physical experience. We recently received approval from Arlington County to begin redeveloping the building that will be vacated by the U.S. Marshalls at the end of this year. Located on Crystal Drive, at the metro, the newly rebranded 1770 Crystal Drive will be fully repositioned with a new skin, new lobby, new systems, new retail and a top four conference center for delivery in early 2018. The building will be surrounded by restaurants and entertainment adding to the street's vitality.","In adjacent Pentagon City we just kicked off pre leasing on our new 699 unit apartment project The Bartlett located directly at top the new Whole Foods and overlooking Washington monuments this 23-storey building is already a Skyline maker. We officially opened in June and are eager to offer the best new amenity package in town to our residents. We continue to be excited about the additional value we can deliver in our DC portfolio, value that will come from leasing up our existing vacancy, finishing our new residential offerings and that offerings that are under construction and building out our development pipeline.","I want to thank you all and I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. You may begin.","Michael Bilerman","Good morning Steve it's Michael Bilerman. I wanted to go back to something you said in your opening remarks which was that Vornado is focused simplified and ready for battle and then you should update it us a little bit in talking about Urban Edge saying the concept of laser focused smaller entities may well be a template for the future and so I'm just curious as you proposed those two statements of you got everything done you've pruned you are ready but yet maybe you sort of brought up this idea again of splitting up into multiple pieces and I'm just curious can you just expand a little bit on where you are within that spectrum and have you are thinking about the various entities?","Steven Roth","Michael, good morning, thanks for the question. You are absolutely correct we are very frustrated by our stock price. We have pursued various strategies to begin to close the gap we think the gap is demonstrable so we are having said that so that's our objective our objective is to move the stock price to what where the fair value of the Company is. And by the way if you just play with numbers if you take Green Streets\u2019 NAV and our current stock price I mean that's a -- and I can't\u2026","Michael Bilerman","Why would I take Green Streets\u2019 NAV wouldn\u2019t I take my NAV?","Steven Roth","Let's take Green Streets\u2019 okay. In any event the discount is very significant so that's the background to all this. The second thing is, is that we exited the retail the non-Manhattan retail business for a variety of reasons we noted several years ago a secular not a cyclical a secular change in retailing patterns we acted upon that, we exited the mall business entirely swapping many of the assets for what we thought were better assets but really and then what we decided we did not want to sell the strip retail business, the Northeast business which by the way had the Bergen Mall in it and two Puerto Rican malls in it so it was a little bit of a hybrid we thought that was a grand business and we thought that the right move was to deconglomerate the business and have a very focused laser focused management on a smaller business.","We see that the business with a great balance sheet, enough cash to succeed and a very, very engaged Board and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased as I said the stock price is appropriate obviously it could be a little bit higher but it's appropriate nowhere near the discount of Vornado and we think it has a great future so that is a very, very interesting template, is that speculation about that we might do a similar thing with Washington we\u2019re up to our eyeballs in considering that. So that is not that is something that is absolutely on the table and we are absolutely considering. We think that was interestingly enough. If you take our Washington business and I also did say at the beginning of my remarks that Washington is in a slow recovery being dragged on by Skyline and we do believe that and our numbers show that by the way. If you look at Washington as a separate segment which has been beaconed up immediately and you project out a four-five-six year growth back to normalcy it is a very high growth very interesting business.","Michael Bilerman","And how would you think about New York in terms of a great street retail business as well as a great office business abutting residential investments that you have there is some element of being a New York specialist and you think about what you have to do at Penn Plaza mixing and matching a lot of different things would that be something that would be on the table or less interesting to split New York up into various pieces?","Steven Roth","My, my, my, you are very provocative. The answer is as you could take in every building and you\u2019d have a separate company from 44th Street to 49th Street we could have a separate one from 59th to 60th Street. We don\u2019t want to speculate on what we might do I've already said very clearly that we are in deep consideration of doing something appropriate with Washington. If you do that then what we have left is a grand New York business pound for pound just a marvelous business with marvelous assets both on the retail side and the office building side we believe that the opportunity we have for value creation in the Penn Plaza Penn Station area is truly unique and is enormous. So, that's a unbelievably interesting, exciting business. The strategies of what we might do with it in terms of capital strategies, venture strategies or anything like that, we don't want to -- I don't want to speculate now, although it is extremely -- and it is a just grand business. The other assets that we have where we -- I mean Michael this is a wonderful asset which is in the middle of its value creation career and 555 California, so the two assets that we have that are outlying New York are the best quality in each of those cities. So, other than what I've already said, I don't think we should speculate although we couldn't be more excited about the quality and the opportunities of the business we have.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. You may begin.","Jamie Feldman","I guess sticking with the same topic, how are you guys thinking currently about the pros and cons of spreading up the balance sheet as well, I mean you talk about Penn Plaza where you have major redevelopment projects, DC also -- just what are your related thoughts in terms of that part of the process?","Steven Roth","I probably was pretty expansive with Michael I don't know what you mean about splitting up the balance sheet further. I mean we have still cash, we said a year ago that these were -- that the right strategy was to push away from overpriced acquisitions to build cash et cetera, we've done that, we're very pleased with the condition of our balance sheet. And I don't really understand your question.","Jamie Feldman","Well I guess you started the call, talking about 4.5 billion of potential liquidity positions you to do larger things if you split the company into I guess two thirds, one third or something along those lines, each of the entities will just have less capital to work with and then your development project\u2019s regenity would obviously be a larger part of the balance sheet?","Steven Roth","Whatever we do in terms of hiving off a business or splitting up or separating or de-conglomerating the -- each business will have appropriate balance sheets to accomplish their missions, we did that very carefully with UE we know how to do that, it's crucial to the success of the businesses, the way we look upon it we are still an owner -- the way I look upon it we are still an owner of UE, we kept our shares, and we need you -- we want UE to thrive just like we want Vornado to thrive and any children, or grand children that might come out of Vornado will be at a similar condition. And by the way we do have the mother ship balance sheet to do it almost anything that we want to. I would tell you that while we do have an enormous amount of liquidity intentionally we consider our silly stock price to be our number one target. I would also tell you just to comment about the balance sheet, I mean Steve Theriot said that our consolidated debt to EBITDA ratio was 7\u2026","Steven Theriot","5.","Steven Roth","7.5 I look at it slightly differently. The way I look at it if you normalize our cash, so saying that we would always have $500 million of cash so that's a $1.5 billion of excess cash so to speak. And you take Skyline which is grossly over levered it has almost $700 million of debt with negligible income. If you take those two out, the number is -- the debt to EBITDA number goes down 6.2.","Steven Theriot","6.1","Steven Roth","I'm sorry 6.1, I'm corrected, which is a wonderful indicator of a really fortress balance sheet.","Jamie Feldman","And then from my follow-up, I think you said you're over 50% sold at 220 Central Park South, last quarter I think you said 53% to 54%, can you just give us an update on where you guys are on actually sale?","Steven Roth","We chose not to, I have said that the market is slowing it's slowing for everybody, it's slowing a little bit less for us, but of course it's flowing for us as well. For competitive reasons I mean what we have said is we have 53 or 54 whatever from last, we're not going backwards from this quarter of course. We are well more than half sold, we've covered our costs, we're fully financed, we're going to -- with two light years away from delivery and I -- it's a cyclical business and for competitive reasons I don't think it's good for our business to give the kind of details minute details, it doesn\u2019t help us, it hurts us competitively in the market. So, we're in great shape, it's a premier project, everybody in the marketplace knows it's the premier project, we're in great shape and we're totally and completely out of financial risk.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. You may begin.","Alexander Goldfarb","Steve, just first question is going to Skyline, can you just remind us of the historic tax perfection and what Vornado has as far as there's a recourse on the 700 million, I mean it would seem as far as just quick banks with a buck, if Skyline is the drag and that's been clearly an issue over the past number of years just sending the keys back with be a win not only for the market cap of Vornado but also just the or I should say in reverse but for the fundamentals of the D.C. portfolio which in fact would help the market cap so can you just remind us what the ability of it for Vornado to just walk away from that asset?","Steven Roth","Good morning, Alex. I won't comment on your comment about walking away from the asset I'll just give you the facts the facts are that Vornado has no recourse what so ever on the loan number one and number two is there is no longer any tax protection on the asset.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And so can we fill in the blank or should we not fill in the blank?","Steven Roth","We are not filling in the blank and if you can think about anything you want to.","Alexander Goldfarb","I have a very creative mind.","Steven Roth","Alexander please it's not appropriate let\u2019s get off this topic.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay.","Steven Roth","I can tell you that we consider every options about everything in our business including this and everything is upon the table always.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. The second question is for David on the New York portfolio. You answered a bunch numbers on the NOI offer for \u201916 but just so we can get it straight the same-store NOI is up over 5%. Can you walk us through what the incremental leasing is from new stuff that is coming in that would be over and above the same-store portfolio?","David Greenbaum","I think most every -- everything is in a same-store.","Steven Roth","Could you just repeat it one more time Alex I'm not sure I understood you?","Alexander Goldfarb","Sure. So you guys did a bunch of leasing as Victoria\u2019s Secret, Swatch and a bunch of other stuff and that was either stuff that was vacant or you guys acquired and got tenants out so I'm not sure if that's in the same-store pool or not so when you guys talk about the same-store pool being up north of 5% I just want to make sure that it's are we jump modeling up that north of 5% or there are other leases or other non same-store properties that we should be thinking about coming in and adding NOI in 2016 in the New York portfolio?","David Greenbaum","Effectively Alex once the redevelopment properties that were taken out of service cycle back into service all other assets in New York are recycled back into a same-store.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. You may begin.","Steve Sakwa ","Thanks, good morning. Steve I was wondering if you can just elaborate a little bit on the One and Two Penn Plaza projects and I realized you haven\u2019t cemented specific dollar figures but can you kind of help us frame out the capital cost that would be needed in order to as you said kind of double the rents on those buildings?","Steven Roth","It's pre-mature but it's certainly a fair question. So first off when you just think about it those two buildings are giant one is 1.5-1.6 million square feet the other one is 2.567 million square feet so in total they are really they are sort of like kissing cousins and they comprise of 4.12 million square feet in total so it's massive number one. Number two is they sit right on top of the busiest train station in North America so that's unbelievable. There are no other buildings that share that honor so to speak. And number three is, is that the -- they are right in the center right at the bull's eye of what we call and the marketplace calls the new west side so it's a tremendous opportunity.","Now having said that one of the real opportunities is, is that the buildings are sufficiently large so that the owner of the building and they are in one ownership so there is lots of benefits to that we can move tenants back and forth between the two buildings. If a tenant needs overflow space or a financial space and we don\u2019t have it in the building that they are in we can move we can fit that up in adjacent building although that's interesting because the buildings historically are always full.","The second thing is we can afford to put a amenity complex into those four plus million square foot buildings that are not economic even for a half a million or a million foot building which are also large buildings and the population of those buildings that will be coursing through this spaces is also enormous and we can put food offerings and even delivery of food into the complexes so there is lots of different ideas that we have many of which are being taken from what the tech industry is doing on their big huge campuses.","Now in terms of what they are going to cost they are both going to be comingled with improvements which will effect Penn Station and the neighborhood and what I mean by that is, is that we are confident that we will -- that the 33rd Street will be close and that gives a great opportunity and both of buildings front on 33rd Street to create entrances into the station to create skylights and light into the stations and what have you so it's very hard to -- which I've already said we are going to participate in or at least we're going to participate in this RFP with all of -- enthusiastically and in a huge way. So, it's hard to separate them.","Now, Penn -- Two Penn we've already said publicly that our plans are to completely skin the building, to take the skin of the building off and replace it with a new skin which will have aesthetic consequences of course but more importantly than that it will allow the -- what our old fashioned punched windows to grow to be almost not quite but almost floor-to-ceiling windows which have large breadth and make the building look like it was built recently which will enormously increase the market value of the building. The skin will also involve the entrance on Seventh Avenue to Penn Station which is directly under our building which is the main entrance to Penn Station, so there's lots of things going on here which are enormously exciting.","The Penn -- the One Penn building will be more like in cost a conventional transformation and upgrade that we would do, more expensive because it's twice the size, the Two Penn will be much more expensive because it involves a total re-skinning. So, it's too early, it's premature to put a number on that but I can tell you that we are unbelievably excited about the opportunity.","Steve Sakwa","I guess the second question follow-up just any comment on Hotel Penn? I know you've obviously said that the hotel market saturated with supply. This is kind of a low RevPAR hotel. Just as you think about transforming that marketplace, how far off in the future is the renovation of Hotel Pennsylvania?","Steven Roth","I don't know the hotel business soft, we're taking our lunch at the Hotel Pennsylvania, it's very cyclical and very volatile and over the years of our ownership it's gone up and down repeatedly, we're in a down cycle now. So, that's step number one. Step number two is, is that we have not been able to land a tenant that would justify raising the building -- an office tenant -- and building an office building and I don't know whether we even think that that's likely or not. So, the answer is, is the Hotel Pennsylvania's time will come, right now we are focusing more on One Penn and Two Penn across the street. And so I think that's my answer. I know you guys -- you have been focused on the Hotel Pennsylvania for a while and we have not yet resolved what the right business plan is for that.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. You may begin.","John Guinee","First, congratulations on an industry leading 55 minutes of prepared comments -- a lot more than some of your peers earlier in earnings season. And also an incredibly impressive summary of all the value creation opportunities, you had something in there about SL Green and putting together $125 NAV on you -- I don't really understand that, but maybe you can get me that offline. But what I'd like to know from David and from Mitchell is\u2026","Steven Roth","Hi John, first of all you have all of us smiling in here, that's the first thing. And the second is the $125 NAV is Green Street.","John Guinee","Okay. I'm not familiar with them, but okay, alright.","Steven Roth","Now you have got us all laughing.","John Guinee","Sorry. So anyhow, so then I'm looking at Page 32 and Page 36 on your sup. And you have a line here and a line there on all this value creation. David, I think where can I find in your public documents more information on seven repositioned assets; three retail locations generating 70 million of EBITDA; two ground-up developments on the Highline? I don't even see them listed on Page 32 or 36. One redeveloped office I'm not sure where that is at all. Mitchell, you've got two demos and a ground-up office building. I don't see that anywhere in the sup. Bartlett, I think there's one line saying that it's a 620,000 zoned square footage. 2211 South Clark, I can't find anything on that, can't find anything on the redevelopment of 770 Crystal Place or 1751. Bell, looks like you have 5.3 million square feet of zoned square footage on Page 36, with a 273 million our basis, is there any information anywhere on any of this stuff at all?","David Greenbaum","I don't know how to answer that.","John Guinee","Well, the answer is no. But could you\u2026","David Greenbaum","If you start at the beginning we'll try to answer you one by one or if you want\u2026","John Guinee","No, no just put it in writing so people can look at it. It wasn't meant to be a question to answer.","David Greenbaum","So, I can only tell you that if what you're saying is, is that the -- our documents need to be enhanced that maybe but we think that our documents so maybe I think we think our documents are extensive and have enormous disclosure in them so maybe you and Steve Theriot and Joe Macnow should have a little conversation.","John Guinee","Will do, thank you.","David Greenbaum","Okay.","John Guinee","All right.","David Greenbaum","But you do point out one thing John which I think is important we have an enormous amount of stuff in the pipeline all of which is has significant value creating opportunities. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Bejjani with Green Street Advisor. You may begin.","John Bejjani","Good morning, guys. David from your prepared remarks it seems pretty clear that you are still seeing robust leasing activity today I expect you've heard concerns and commentary from your New York peers regarding job and rent growth later this year and noncore properties maybe re-pricing lower I'm just curious are you expecting those kind of changes yourselves down the road and I guess related to this Mitchell do you have similar concerns with respect to asset valuation and the D.C. metro?","David Greenbaum","First, John and good morning how are you? Now listen as it relates to New York I think Steve has said that we haven\u2019t really seen any real co-hiccups at this point in time and I think that's absolutely accurate so the pipeline that we have is extraordinarily full. We have seen what I'll call is in one or two very, very limited instances on some small deals companies effectively as Steve mentioned hit the pause button and generally I will tell you as we looked at fourth quarter of the actual activity as well as everything that were working on here in the first quarter, I think I used the word that our pipeline remains strong it does I have got my leasing guys today in least negotiations round the clock on some very big deals and what's interesting is a number of those deals that we we\u2019re working on once again and I think this is really important represent expansions by companies in New York it is not just the musical chairs business as I said last year some 750,000 plus square feet of our deals were real growth to the city what's fascinating is not withstanding some of the climate on the financial markets we really have continued to see the guys that have good businesses good business platforms continuing to look to grow in the city.","Mitchell Schear","John we are very constructive we believe that business continues to be good we as I said in my remarks we\u2019re looking over our shoulders because we are seasoned warriors and we know that this kind of volatility makes decision makers and counter parties just pause for a second and say what's going on here which is only natural and only expected okay. So, the first thing is we see no deterioration in the New York Offices that's step one what's going to happen nine months or a year from now that's another question and we see no basis upon which to believe that nine months or a year from now the New York office business will be any different than it is today. So that's step one I think obviously if there is a huge deterioration in the economy all bets are off okay so that's step one.","Step two is, is that New York passage from an enormously diverse business community and there are any given time certain sectors which are expanding and certain sectors are contracting we see no signs that people like Amazon or Facebook or their ilk are doing anything other than full steam ahead and expanding aggressively so a lot of what happens to the individual companies is a function of the mix of their assets and to which segment of the office market they cater to so I can only tell you that we stand by our remarks that we think business is good and we believe that it will continue to be good for the foreseeable future.","John Bejjani","That's helpful. Thanks. And I guess just the second piece of my question, with respect to asset valuations, are you guys -- are you cautious on that front looking forward or any reason to expect any movement in cap rates?","Mitchell Schear","The answer is sure. The first thing is, is I think some secondary assets I can't vouch for what the pricing is on secondary assets. For prime assets we see no diminishing in pricing we do see that there are fewer bidders than at the hysterical top of the market maybe whatever that was a year ago or whatever and so we think that the big thing is, is that and I sort of said this in my remarks this sworn I'll call it a sworn for the moment for want of a better word and the volatility in the capital markets I believe and most commentators believe will cause an extension of the low interest rate, easy money environment that we have found ourselves in for years and years now. And it's very hard to understand how with the treasury of 1.8 today that cap rates could go above -- go into the -- go above 4.5 let's say into the fives and sixes. So, the interest rate environment and the wall of liquidity which still exists, is an anchor on keeping pricing firm. The next part of it is, is that it's not random that we and our colleagues operate in New York City which we consider to be the magnet for both domestic and international capital to invest in real-estate and also it's when volatility -- history has shown that when there's volatility in the capital markets after the initial jitters are over this real-estate becomes an extraordinarily important store of value and has over decades and decades. Michael Franco is in the room who's our Chief Investment Officer, do you have anything else to answer that?","Michael Franco","No, like I think the only thing I would say is that buyers that are more driven by financing as Steve alluded to earlier where the cost of borrowing has gone up and more impacted and so those transitional assets, I think we'll see a little bit of near term softening but in terms of Class A assets, the demand for that and the pricing -- I don't think is going to change much.","Mitchell Schear","Also John I put into my remarks the example of what we did in financing 770 Broadway intentionally because I think it's an extraordinary execution. So, let me just discuss it again. What we did there was it's a 1.1 million square foot building which has extraordinary tenants, by the way it's a mature building which is my way of saying it's -- basically it's a Wanamaker's department store, so it has enormous floor plates, high ceilings, great windows, it's a terrific building and a terrific spot. Although it is not anywhere -- it is not by any stretch a new steel and glass building, anyway. So, we financed it, we refinanced the $350 odd million loan in the 5s for a $700 million and we did it on a floating rate basis and it floated at LIBOR 1.75% and then we swapped the floating rate to six. So, we have an extensive capital markets team here and we analyzed every different option in terms of both the duration of loan and floating fixed et cetera. And the -- so we basically have borrowed a -- made it a five year fixed loan, it's actually technically four and a half year fixed which is another whole tale. We swapped it for four and a half years and the rate is 2.56, now it's -- that's an extraordinary rate for a high quality building, it's really hard to see how cap rates rise with that kind of finance available that in fact and this may sound crazy to you cap rates may well decline a little bit. So, there you have it.","John Bejjani","Thanks. That's very interesting. I guess just one last question. There have been rumblings in the press over the last handful of months that you guys are exploring repurposing the office space at 666 Fifth. I was just wondering if you guys could comment on this, whether such a plan is in the works or anything you could say?","Mitchell Schear","The answer is it's premature, 666 and I -- this same exact question came up last call and basically what I said last call still stands for this call. The asset is a grand asset, it's right in the heart of 5th Avenue, it is the -- we own the retail strip which is Uniqlo and Hollister which is three quarters of the block front. We do not own the Zara store, which is their flagship store which is owned by Zara. So, we own the retail, the office building we own half the retail together with a co-venture partner.","Steven Roth","Office.","Mitchell Schear","I\u2019m sorry half of the office building together with a co-venture partner, the building has a very hefty loan on it, so it's basically almost a -- let me leave it that way it has a very hefty loan. So the partners have been exploring options which center around the concept that the land unencumbered by building is worth more than the existing assets that are on the building -- on the land. Said another way the highest and best use for that property is not at an office building. So, there's been lots of exploratory thinking about what is the right thing -- the right business plan with that asset and I think that's -- it's premature, it's an unbelievable asset and location and I think that's what I have to say.","Steven Roth","I apologize to everybody for the duration of this call, but we certainly had a lot of things that we wanted to say.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Lewis with SunTrust. Your may begin.","Michael Lewis","Thank you. So I'll keep the call going, I guess. So you delivered on your goal to end the year with nearly $2 billion in cash. Good leverage and liquidity. But if you had to guess, do you think some of that dry powder eventually gets used to fund opportunistic acquisitions? In other words, maybe values are peaking or opportunities will shake loose. And I feel like I'm kind of getting mixed messages on that, not just from you. Or do you think that capital eventually gets driven into opportunities in your existing portfolio, which we've talked a lot about?","Steven Roth","First of all were in a great position intentionally so, so having cash in this times of an environment is -- having cash in any environment is good having cash and this kind of an environment is even better so number one is we are delighted with it with our balance sheet we are delighting with our cash position and our financial flexibility we think it's a very important strategic competitive advantage to have. Having said that the options for our cash and liquidity are as you just said internal or external now, external is acquisitions so and what have to be a hell of an acquisition to be a better buy than for example our stock price so having said that, although unique acquisitions will get our attention even at a silly stock price so we have external opportunities we have nothing in mind and I would be -- it's a stress to even think what would make us weight into this marketplace with heavy cash.","Now we turn to internal. Internal there is two things our stock and the best array of internal capital opportunities we have to invest capital and we believe high returns in our existing portfolio and with our existing assets and inventory so those are the options. It's premature to say what we will do clearly we are going to invest internally every single internal project that we have on our place Penn Station, the Chelsea buildings some development in -- limited development in Washington every single one of those will get its fair share of capital and will be done anything else is discretionary and it's premature.","Michael Lewis","Okay, thanks. My second question is about DC, and you touched on this again a little bit. As far as Skyline, assuming you don't put back the keys, the occupancy is already quite low. What does kind of the future hold for those assets to kind of turn those around? And then in Crystal City, I realize the occupancy is up, but maybe you could talk a little bit about the economics there and if you are really making money on those leases? And is that kind of where that zero to $4 million of core DC EBITDA is coming from; or is that elsewhere?","Steven Roth","Mitchell you want to take that?","Mitchell Schear","Sure. So with respect to Skyline, Skyline is in a challenged position today historically Skyline has attracted certain government agencies and have had significant follow-on in terms of government contractors and there has been obviously been some dislocation in that market so I think that Skyline is going to take some time to recover the vacancy is going to drop another 500 basis points or so this year through some schedule explorations particularly of contractors who won't renew so occupancy I'm sorry occupancy will decline and so I think that's basically the situation and it's really a it will take time to really to find the right engine or the right growth engine that will occupy space there that we are having a follow on effect will return to the situation that it was in just obviously very close proximity to the proximity to the Pentagon and will make sense over the long run we just can predict at this point how long it will take and given some of the other vacancies in the marketplace.","With respect to Crystal City I think we\u2019re constructive on Crystal City and we\u2019re happy with the progress that we've made in terms of leasing it's obviously a competitive market but down the less we are constructive with the progress that we've made in terms of moving a significant amount of the inventory at this point in time we\u2019re not moving our rents up we certainly think that the rents and concessions have bottomed so we will keep close eye and see how that moves off into the future and with respect to the core business increases I think it's sprinkled around the whole portfolio I can't give you a specific answer on the phone today.","Operator","And our final question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. You may begin.","Manny Korchman","I was almost ready to say good afternoon, guys. But good morning, so just a couple quick follow ups here, I hope.","Steven Roth","You've to have got us smiling.","Manny Korchman","If we think about your lease rate versus occupied rate and I think that's what's causing some questions on the numbers both in \u201915 and going into \u201916. What were those numbers at year-end \u201914 and then yearend \u201915? I think that will help us get to where you might go excluding any sort of new leasing and we can think about that separately into '16?","Steven Roth","That sounds to me a sufficiently technical question that although a valid question, that I would ask that my financial guys get a hold of you off-line because I don't think that we can get those numbers accurately within a ten second answer.","Manny Korchman","The second one, which is still technical -- less so -- and I hope you have this one. Steve, you said that the line of credit was undrawn. At 12\/31, it looks like there's 550 million drawn there as well as some draw on the term loan. Can you just walk us through the mechanics of how it was paid down? Because I don't think you got enough out of the refis to get there?","Steven Roth","Let's say well the term loan -- the $550 million that was outstanding on the revolver at year-end was repaid in early January out of proceeds of cash plus transactions that closed in January. It would be a struggle for me to actually match for you the sources and uses but we can do that for you offline if you like. But the term loan which is a separate and distinct facility which was taken which is $750 million which was taken out for the specific purpose of matching against the capital requirements for 220 Central Park South is in the amount of $750 million and we had $187 million drawn at the end of the year. Okay I'm advised that we have no further questions. I appreciate everybody -- how many people are still left on the call?","Cathy Creswell","100.","Steven Roth","Wow, so I appreciate all of you sticking with us. And we had a lot -- we felt we had a lot to say and so we appreciate your attention, we appreciate your interest in Vornado and we'll sign off and see you at the next call.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference, thank you for your participation.

My name is Yolanda, and I\u2019ll be your operator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions]","Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Cathy Creswell. You may begin.","Cathy Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust's fourth quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our fourth quarter earnings release and filed our annual report on form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents, as well as our supplemental financial information package, are available on our website, www.vno.com, under the Investor Relations section.","In these documents, and during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly-comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, form 10-K, and financial supplement.","Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K, for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. ","The call may include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today's date. The Company does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.","On the call today from management for our opening comments are Steven Roth, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; David Greenbaum, President of the New York division; Mitchell Schear, President of the Washington DC division; and Stephen Theriot, Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room are Wendy Silverstein and Michael Franco, Executive Vice Presidents, Co-Heads of Acquisitions and Capital Markets, and Joseph Macnow, Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Administrative Officer. I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thank you, Cathy, and good morning, everyone. It's a bright, sunny, crisp day here in New York. Welcome to Vornado's fourth quarter call.","Vornado had a great quarter, and I'm very pleased with our financial results, both for the quarter and for the year. Fourth quarter comparable FFO was $1.36 per share, 8.8% higher than last year's fourth quarter. Full-year comparable FFO was $5.20 per share, 9% higher than 2013.","In January, we completed on schedule the spin-off of our retail strips and malls business into Urban Edge Properties, which is now traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol UE. Our strategy here was that both Vornado and UE would benefit from being separate and focused. I'm certain that UE's dedicated management team, led by Jeff Olson, focusing solely on these fine assets, will create enormous value.","During 2014 we acquired, with a partner, for $700 million, the St. Regis retail on Fifth Avenue. Retail adjacency's here are the Valentino flagship on one side and the Polo flagship on the other. We increased our ownership interest in One Park Avenue, a 942,000 square foot office building, to 55%.","We also acquired the land under our 715 Lexington Avenue retail property, and acquired several other small retail properties. Further, we are in contract to acquire the fully leased 437,000 square-foot Center Building on Northern Boulevard in Long Island City, for $142 million, $325 per square foot. And we invested $426 million to advance important internal development projects, which will total as much as $2 billion when completed.","In December, we sold 1740 Broadway for $605 million, $1,000 per square foot. The financial statement gain on the sale was $440 million, the tax gain of $484 million was deferred, in a like-kind exchange for the acquisition of the St. Regis Fifth Avenue retail. Just last week, we increased our ownership interest in the Times Square Crowne Plaza property, to 33% from 11%. This property, located at 48th Street and Broadway, is comprised of a 795 key hotel, 7,700 square feet of prime retail space, signage, 197,000 square feet of office space, and a 150 space parking garage.","2014 was a great year for us, in New York City in particular. You may have seen the lead article in Monday's New York Times, which cited that New York City has created more jobs over the past five years, than during any five-year period in the last 50 years. And this was accomplished with less than 1% of job creation coming from the big banks and brokerages, who have historically been the big drivers. The article have cited that tech, hotels, health services, etcetera, etcetera all took up the slack.","New York does indeed have a vibrant growing, and most importantly, a diversified economy. Over these five years, Vornado has responded to changes in the marketplace. In fact, about half of our record-breaking 4.2 million square feet of New York office leasing activity this year was the tech, TAMI, and creative tenants, in properties that we have tailored to those tenants' needs and likes. Some of our creative class tenants include Google , Facebook , Bloomberg, Cisco , EMC , Information Builders, AMC Networks, AOL , Motorola Mobility, Yelp, PayPal, 1871, Razorfish, WeWork, IPG, Recordfuel, T-Mobile, L3 Communications, Yodle, Dice, Publicis, you get the idea, and Amazon, who recently leased 470,000 square feet, at our Seven West 34th Street.","Now let me take a moment to share some thoughts with you. We believe that operating in New York, the most important city in the world, and in Washington, DC, our nation's capital, is the right strategy for us. The fact that we own a world-class asset in Chicago and another in San Francisco is the exception that proves the rule. Parenthetically, we get frequent incomings about these assets in Chicago and San Francisco.","Asset prices today are high, and acquisitions are getting dicey. We are now at the point in the cycle where the easy money has been made, and it seems to me that this is a better time to harvest than to invest. I am very constructive on New York City, where demand, activity, and absorption are accelerating. And where office rents are now rising smartly, and will I believe, rise to the point where they justify today's asset prices, as they have in past cycles.","As Steve Theriot will tell you shortly, our internal budgets are that our cash balances will approach $2 billion by the end of this year. Our sense is that this is the time in the cycle when the smart guys build cash. We will continue to build cash reserves for opportunities that will undoubtedly present themselves in the future.","Our business is valued today at over $35 billion. I believe that the private market value of our assets is higher. In my mind, we get no value for our empty space in Washington, and no value at all for our business platform.","The fact is, we are one of only a handful of firms who have the heft, talent, relationships and trust in the marketplace to lease, acquire, develop, finance, and manage million foot towers and Fifth Avenue retail. It's a complicated business, rookies need not apply. Kudos to our 4,500 team members.","To sum up, I'm very pleased with both our operating performance and our progress on focusing the business. Investor demand worldwide for our kind of New York Real Estate is indeed robust. In fact, demand and pricing is the strongest we have ever seen in our careers.","A final note about our website. Next month, we will launch a brand-new state-of-the-art website. It will be full of high-quality information. Please log on and take a look for yourself. Now I'll turn it over to CFO, Steve Theriot, to cover more details of our financial results, after which David and Mitchell will exhaustively cover New York and Washington.","Stephen Theriot","Thank you, Steve. Yesterday we reported fourth quarter comparable FFO of $1.36 per share, up from $1.25 in the prior year's fourth quarter, an 8.8% increase. Comparable FFO was $5.20 for the full year, up 9% from 2013.","Total FFO for the fourth quarter was $1.22 per share, as compared to negative $0.04 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter. Total FFO for the year was $4.83 per share, as compared to $3.41 in 2013. Our comparable EBITDA was $423 million for the quarter, and $1.7 billion for the year.","Our New York business produced $257.4 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, ahead of last year's fourth quarter by 7.6%. For the year, our New York business produced $975 million of comparable EBITDA, ahead of 2013 by 6.6%. Our Washington business produced $81.1 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, lower than last year's fourth quarter by $2.2 million or 2.6%.","For the year, our Washington business produced $333.8 million of comparable EBITDA, lower than 2013 by $7.4 million or 2.2%. More than offsetting, the decline in comparable EBITDA, we realized an incremental reduction in interest expense of $16 million in 2014, from the restructuring of the Skyline mortgage loan, and so net-net, our Washington segment's contribution to 2014 comparable FFO is $8.6 million ahead of last year. We expect Washington's 2015 comparable EBITDA will be flat with 2014.","As Steve mentioned, we completed the spin-off of Urban Edge Properties on schedule on January 15. We will classify the historical financial results of the UE portfolio as discontinued operations, beginning in the first quarter of 2015. Our redevelopment of Springfield Town Center was completed during the fourth quarter, and the transfer of the property to Pennsylvania REIT is scheduled to be completed next month. Please see our press release, or the Overview in MD&A on pages 39 and 40 of our form 10-K for a detailed summary of non-comparable items.","Now turning to capital markets. In October, we redeemed $445 million of 7 7\/8% senior unsecured notes. We have $2.5 billion of unsecured revolving credit facilities, in two $1.25 billion facilities, with zero outstanding at year-end.","In October, we renewed and extended one of our two $1.25 billion facilities. The renewed facility matures in November 2018, a three-year extension, with two six-month extension options. The interest rate on this facility was lower to LIBOR plus 105 basis points, from LIBOR plus 125 basis points, and the facility fee was reduced to 20 basis points from 25 basis points. The other facility matures in June 2017, with two six-month extension options.","Also in October, we completed a $140 million financing of 655 Fifth Avenue, the Ferragamo flagship store. The loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.4%, currently 1.56%, and matures in October 2019, with two one-year extension options. In December, we completed a $575 million refinancing of Two Penn Plaza. The loan is interest only, at LIBOR plus 1.65%, and matures in 2019, with two one-year extension options.","The previous $422 million loan on the property, was swapped to a fixed rate of 4.78% through March 2018. Therefore, $425 million of the new loan will be fixed through March 2018 at a rate of 4.78%, and the balance of $153 million floats through March 2018. The entire $575 million will float thereafter for the duration of the new loan.","In January 2015, we repaid $500 million of 4.25% unsecured notes due April 2015, when they first became freely pre-payable. Adjusting our year-end liquidity for the $500 million repayment in January, and the$225 million of cash spun off to UE, we have $3.365 billion in liquidity, comprised of $865 million of cash, restricted cash, and marketable securities, and $2.5 billion undrawn under our revolving credit facilities. As Steve Roth mentioned, we expect our cash balance to approach $2 billion by the end of the year, resulting from the completion of the transfer of the Springfield Town Center to pre-financing the St. Regis retail condo, and refinancing another asset.","Our consolidated debt to enterprise value was 29.8% based on a post-UE spin stock price of $112.88, and our consolidated debt to EBITDA is 6.8 times. Our debt mix is balanced with fixed rate debt accounting for 83% of the total, with the weighted average rate of 4.37% and a weighted average term of 5.3 years, and floating rate debt accounting for 17% of the total, with a current weighted average interest rate of 2.2%, and a weighted average term of 4.4 years. Our remaining 2015 maturities totaled just $243 million. And with that, I'll turn it over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business.","David Greenbaum","Steve, thank you. And good morning everyone, my remarks this morning are going to be a bit longer than usual, but there is a lot to talk about. In addition to our results for the fourth quarter, I want to focus on our activities for the entire year, as well as trends in the marketplace, which is where I'm going to begin.","2014 was a milestone year. The recovery gained significant momentum over the course of the past year. Overall leasing volume in Manhattan in 2014 came in at 39.9 million square feet, an all-time record high. Importantly, new leases as opposed to renewals, accounted for 70% of this activity, with new leases being the highest percentage of total activity since 1998.","Tenant demand is now being driven less by churn in the marketplace, and more by tenant expansions. Businesses are coming off the sidelines and are executing plans for growth, seeking opportunities to densify and redefine the workplace to recruit talent. We are continuing to see a secular change toward a preference for the live, work, play environment of urban centers. The workforce is now dictating corporate location decisions.","We made way more than our fair share of deals in 2014, having completed 4.2 million square feet of leasing activity in Manhattan, 10.5% of all activity in the marketplace. Importantly, 28% of our 4.2 million square feet of leasing, some 1.2 million square feet, represented tenants new to, or expanding in New York, real expansion, real growth in the marketplace.","Leasing activity for larger spaces is also on the rise. 29 new leases exceeding 100,000 square feet were signed in 2014, the highest level in 10 years. We completed six of these 100,000-plus square foot new headquarters leases.","Let me tick them off: Amazon, 470,000 square feet, Google, 178,000 feet. Facebook, 100,000 feet, Neuberger Berman, 402,000 feet. New York & Company, 178,000 square feet and Publicis, 114,000 square feet.","Including renewals, we completed 12 deals over 100,000 square feet in 2014. For the year, overall absorption in Manhattan, according to Cushman & Wakefield, reached 10.8 million square feet, the highest level of absorption ever recorded. The only other time that absorption in this city surpassed 10 million square feet was in 2000. Manhattan's overall vacancy rate continued to decline, down 1.6% to 9.3%.","Absorption and employment, of course, are directly linked, and New York City's office-using employment continued to expand, gaining 29,000 jobs in 2014. Since office-using employment bottomed in October of 2009, New York City has added 148,000 office using jobs, having recovered nearly twice, twice the office using jobs lost in the recession.","The Creative industries, as Steve mentioned, are leading the charge and are fueling the growth. The total TAMI, technology, advertising, media, and information, employment in New York City, is currently over 300,000, second only to the Bay Area in California. TAMI tenants committed to more than 13.4 million square feet in 2014, close to 34% of total leasing activity.","This trend continued to accelerate in the fourth quarter, with six of the top 10 deals signed involving tech and creative firms, including the two largest, both of which are Vornado deals. Amazon's 470,000 square foot lease at Seven West 34th Street, and AMC Networks renewal expansion for 324,000 square feet at 11 Penn Plaza. We have been working hard to reposition our portfolio to attract the creative type tenants, and we have been enormously successful. TAMI tenants represented 46% of our total leasing activity in 2014, some 1.9 million square feet.","The high-end financial service firms have also been very active, accounting for 19% of total leasing citywide last year. And they continue to be the driving force behind the leasing velocity for high-end trophy assets. New York City had 97 leases signed last year at rents $100 a foot and higher, compared with $91 at the market peak in 2008. In our own portfolio, at 280 Park, 350 Park, 640 Fifth Avenue, 650 Madison, and 888 Seventh Avenue, we closed 13 of the 97 deals, and then we averaged starting rents for those deals over $115 per square foot.","While rent increases over the last several years have been moderate, with a 6.8% increase recorded in 2014, the market is now at equilibrium between tenants and landlords. Looking at 2015, consensus in the brokerage community is that continued job growth will drive New York's office demand, and will accelerate the shift to a landlord's market. We absolutely agree.","Turning now to Vornado's performance. In 2014, we leased an unprecedented 4.2 million square feet in New York in 158 transactions, including the Mart in Chicago and 555 California in San Francisco, my leasing team completed more than 5 million square feet of deals in 226 transactions.","We had a very diverse mix of high-quality tenants across many business sectors. TAMI, the creatives, we did 35 deals totaling 2.2 million square feet, including Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Braintree, Yelp, Facebook, Cisco, AMC Networks, Madison Square Garden, Wenner Media, 1871, the Chicago Entrepreneurial Hub, and Matter, a bioscience incubator.","In Financial Services, we did 59 deals totaling some 1.1 million square feet, including Neuberger Berman, Dodge & Cox, Bloomberg, AXA Equitable, Guggenheim, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Taconic Capital Advisors, Blue Mountain Capital, and Napier Park Global Capital. And in the legal sector we did 11 deals, some 400,000 square feet, including national firms Kirkland & Ellis, Jones Day, Fenwick & West, Foley & Lardner, and Akerman Senterfitt.","Focusing now, specifically on the fourth quarter, our New York leasing totaled 1.248 million square feet in 37 transactions. Activity was well-balanced throughout the portfolio and not concentrated within any one sub market. Year-end occupancy was 96.9%, up 40 basis points from the third quarter. Basically we are full.","Our average starting rent this quarter was a healthy $66.79, with very strong positive mark-to-markets of 21.4% GAAP and 12.6% cash. For the year, our mark-to-markets in New York were 18.8% GAAP, and 12.7% cash.","In the fourth quarter, we completed the two largest leases in the market: Amazon.com, the Seattle-based retailing giant, committed to a 470,000 square foot New York City headquarters lease in Seven West 34th Street, substantially the entire building. This was Midtown Manhattan's largest new lease of the year and it encompasses office, retail, and fulfillment center components throughout the 12-story building.","Similar to our 1.1 million square foot 770 Broadway, Seven West 34th Street was originally constructed as a department store, and has great - with expansive floor plates and generous ceiling heights. Over the past year we redeveloped and repositioned this asset to attract TAMI tenants, and after an extensive market-wide search, Amazon selected our asset to be its New York headquarters. We converted this formerly underperforming showroom building for the giftware industry, into a fully modernized cool office building, and have created enormous value.","At 11 Penn Plaza, we completed a 324,000 square foot renewal expansion with AMC Networks. This was an important tenant for us to keep in Penn Plaza. AMC looked around the market and ultimately decided to remain committed to 11 Penn. The key to making this deal with AMC, was finding growth space for them in a fully occupied building.","We were able to unlock floors 17, 22, and 23, enabling AMC to expand by 61,000 square feet. AMC will be completely rebuilding their existing space. 11 Penn, a 1.1 million square foot office building is now fully-leased long-term to AMC, Macys, and Maddison Square Gardens.","At 1290 Sixth Avenue, Neuberger Berman expanded by an additional 47,000 square feet in the fourth quarter, furthering their commitment as our anchor tenant in this completely repositioned asset. Neuberger will begin construction later this year on their 402,000 square foot headquarters space in 1290.","There are few deals we also completed over the last several weeks in the first quarter that I want to highlight. At 770 Broadway, we just signed an 80,000 square foot expansion with Facebook. In May of 2013, Facebook signed their initial lease at 770 Broadway for about 100,000 square feet.","Over the past 20 months, Facebook has expanded to 275,000 square feet, incredible growth. In addition to Facebook, 770 Broadway is home to AOL with 228,000 square feet, and J. Crew, with 375,000 square feet. 770 is now the best office building in Midtown South commanding triple digit rents.","At 280 Park, again, over the last several weeks, we signed a major financial services lease for 127,000 square feet with Fiduciary Trust in the base of the building, and are in final lease drafts with an important investment bank for another 99,000 square feet. Our renovation program is now substantially complete, and has been a resounding success. Since we acquired the building in 2011 with these two new leases, we will have leased over 700,000 square feet at blended starting rents averaging just under $95 per square foot.","Let me now turn to Manhattan Street retail. For the quarter, we executed 13 retail leases, aggregating 51,000 square feet, with positive mark-to-markets of 77.2% GAAP and 48.3% cash.","In the bow-tie in Times Square at 1535 Broadway, the Marriott Marquis full block front, 45th to 46th Streets, and directly across from our 1540 Broadway, we launched the world's largest 10K LED sign in November, with Google as the first advertiser. After a six-week run on the signs, we now have Beats, which is owned by Apple, advertising in the upper portion of the sign for this entire year, 2015. The sign has received unbelievable attention in the worldwide media.","In the fourth quarter, we completed a lease with T-Mobile for 4,000 square feet on the grade at the 46th Street corner of the property. In addition, T-Mobile long-term leased the lower portion of the LED sign above their storefront. We're now in active discussions with multiple tenants for retail stores and signage.","At 640 Fifth Avenue, we completed a temp deal in the first quarter with Forever 21, for the former H&M space. While maintaining the cash flow at this property, this deal allows us to find the perfect mix of tenants for the space. We also negotiated an agreement with Citibank to relocate its retail branch at 640, across the Street to 666 Fifth Avenue, enabling us to take back the existing bank branch at 640 later this summer.","This now enables us to offer the full 100 linear feet of Fifth Avenue frontage. On the Long Island Rail Road Concourse at One Penn, we've been working to upgrade some of the tenants, and have added a new Duane Reade and a Pret a Manger, both of which are opening in the next several months.","Let me now turn to San Francisco. In San Francisco, we had a really strong year at our 1.8 million square foot 555 California Street, completing 502,000 square feet of leases in 11 transactions at very strong rents, with mark-to-markets of 23%, and average starting rents just under $70 per square foot. In the fourth quarter we signed a 122,000 square foot renewal lease with the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. It was the largest lease of the quarter in San Francisco.","In Chicago at The Mart, our 3.6 million square foot building at the epicenter of Chicago's hot River North market, we continued the evolution of this building into a home for creative and technology-based tenants. We completed 372,000 square feet of leasing in 2014, including 52,000 square feet in the fourth quarter.","Our showroom to office conversion, continues to progress, similar to the conversion of Seven West 34th Street in New York, from underperforming showrooms for the giftware industry into creative office space at The Mart. We're in the process of converting the entire 200,000 square foot 13th floor, again, from giftware showrooms, to creative office space. Our year-end occupancy dipped as we vacated this floor, but we are now working on several office deals for the floor.","Also, in the last couple of weeks, we completed an expansion with Yelp. Yelp now leases 60,000 square feet in The Mart. Think about it, Yelp which did not have an office in Chicago a year ago, expects its employee headcount to approach 375 over the next couple of months. Amazing growth.","In addition to our historic leasing year, we had an incredibly busy year with our development and redevelopment activities, which will continue into 2015. At Seven West and 330 West 34th Street, we transformed these buildings into 1.1 million square feet of tech and creative space. At 280 Park Avenue, our full block lobby, mid-block jewel box atrium, and new curtain wall, have made 280 one of the best buildings on Park Avenue, with JPMorgan Chase's world headquarters as our direct next-door neighbor.","We've now commenced our building redevelopment program at 90 Park Avenue. We're in the design phase for 150,000 square foot ground-up, new build, a cutting-edge office and retail building at 61 Ninth Avenue, next to the Apple Store and Chelsea Market, and directly across from Google's New York headquarters.","At 20 Broad Street, where the New York Stock Exchange has been headquartered for over 50 years, you may recently have read that ICE, the Intercontinental Exchange, which acquired NYSE Euronext in 2013, recently announced that it will be vacating 20 Broad, in June 2016 upon the lease expiration, relocating many of the employees to Atlanta. Obviously, this was not a surprise to us. We currently are evaluating re-tenanting the building as an office building, or redeveloping the asset into a residential building. I'll also say, reflecting on the increasing level of activity in the downtown marketplace, we already have responded to a tenant that requested a lease proposal for the entire 540,000 square foot building.","In Times Square, we completed the world's largest LED sign at 1535 Broadway, and have begun delivering the 45,000 square feet of retail space. Also in 2014 at 608 Fifth Avenue, we created a 44,000 square foot, four-level flagship for Topshop, Topman. And at 689 Fifth Avenue, we restored the base of a landmark building to its original limestone grandeur.","At 220 Central Park south, we recently completed excavation and foundations for our 950-foot tall, luxury residential condominium tower. Starting in April, you'll begin to see the building coming out of the ground. For our Alexander's affiliate, we built a 312-unit rental apartment tower on top of the Rego Park II shopping center. We expect to begin leasing apartments in May.","We also have vacated and commenced demolition, of a spectacular development site we own with a 50% partner at 29 to 33 West 57th Street. It's just west of Nine West 57th Street, and steps off of Fifth Avenue.","To conclude my remarks, let me summarize the entire New York division. We had a very strong quarter, with same-store EBITDA increases for the overall division of 3.3% GAAP and 8.2% cash. For the year, our same-store EBITDA increases for the overall division were 4.7% GAAP and 7.6% cash.","Isolating just the New York office business, our same-store EBITDA increases for the quarter were 3.5% GAAP and 9.1% cash, and for the year, our same-store increases were 5% GAAP and 7.8% cash. The last two years our EBITDA growth has come from pushing rents, evidenced by our strong same-store growth, which has averaged 5% GAAP and 7.6% cash, over 2013 and 2014. In 2015, our EBITDA growth will be coming both from same-store growth, and just as importantly, placing assets back into service, which is not part of the same-store calculation, with 280 Park Avenue, Seven West 34th Street, 330 West 34th Street and 1535 Broadway, all coming back online.","Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Mitchell to cover Washington.","Mitchell Schear","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In Washington, while we have not yet fully rebounded from the impacts of sequestration and BRAC, it's clear that we\u2019re now recovering. Unemployment has dropped to 5.6% from 6.7% a year ago.","And job growth ticked up by the end of 2014, adding nearly 19,000 jobs in the year ending November 30, 2014. In the same period, office-using, professional and business services added 4,700 jobs. That's a positive shift from the trend earlier in the year and in 2013, when this sector, largely driven by contractors, was shedding jobs at a rapid pace in response to sequestration.","Negative absorption in Northern Virginia is now getting close to zero, and we're seeing positive absorption in downtown DC. And on the ground, tenant tour activity in all sectors has increased noticeably, and all signs point to continued improvement this year and next. Specifically in our portfolio, as Steve Theriot said a few minutes ago, and in keeping with the current market conditions, we expect our EBITDA for 2015 to be about even with 2014.","We had an active fourth quarter of 2014, leading into a strong pipeline of tenant activity heading into the first quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter alone, we leased 669,000 square feet of office and retail space. Overall, office leases signed in the fourth quarter generated a GAAP mark-to-market of negative 6.7%, and a cash mark-to-market of negative 7.7%, a result we expected given the competitive market.","The deals in the DC market continue to acquire significant TIs. TIs and leasing commissions for the leases we signed during the fourth quarter were 17.7% of initial rents, or $6.54 per square foot per annum, and this is compared to 12.9% or $5.09 for the first nine months of the year.","For Q4 2014 versus Q4 2013, we reported negative same-store EBITDA of minus 2.3% GAAP and minus 3.8% cash. Notwithstanding difficult market conditions, we continue to lease a lot of space each year. We leased 2.1 million square feet in 2012, 1.8 million square feet in 2013, and over 1.9 million square feet of office and retail space in 2014. This was in 235 deals, and our average office rents were $38.57, down from $39.91 in 2013.","About 50% of this activity was from new leasing, and the remaining 50% were renewals. Overall occupancy, including residential and Skyline was up 40 basis points, from 2013 to 83.8%. Office occupancy including Skyline was up 20 basis points to 80.9%.","Let's focus on Skyline for a minute. Our office occupancy, excluding Skyline, was up 210 basis points to 87.5%. Skyline's occupancy fell during 2014 by 730 basis points to 53.5%, an obvious drag on our overall office performance.","In contrast, Crystal City's office occupancy rose by 330 basis points to 85.2%, and we expect that trend to continue. Our aggressive leasing efforts in Crystal City have begun to bear fruit, in fact, Crystal City was one of the only submarkets in Northern Virginia to experience positive net absorption. Our residential business is comprised of 2,400 apartments in Crystal City, Pentagon City, Rosslyn, and Georgetown, and it continues to be full, with occupancy increasing 110 basis points over 2013 to 97.4%, and with 2014 average monthly rents per unit of $2,078, and that's compared to $2,101 for 2013.","In 2015, we have 1.68 million square feet expiring. Of that number, we expect less than 300,000 square feet, or about 17%, to vacate without a replacement tenant in hand. Of the remaining 1.4 million square feet, we have already signed, or have pending signatures, for over 500,000 square feet or 38%. We are pleased with this progress and consider the balance to be completely manageable.","There were several highlights this past year, and some trends that will continue into 2015. First, and importantly, is government leasing. At a time of reduced government activity, we leased 473,000 square feet to the federal government in 15 deals during 2014.","As previously announced, the Department of Labor leased 75,000 square feet at Crystal Gateway North. We renewed, for 15 years, the Department of Justice at One Skyline Tower, for 169,000 square feet. And in 2015, we've renewed the Army Surgeon General for five years at Six Skyline. This is a 97,301 square foot renewal, and it\u2019s part of our BRAC space in Skyline.","And this month, we executed a 15-year lease with United States Marshal Service for its 371,000 square foot headquarters in Crystal City. The US Marshals have been our tenant in Crystal City for 15 years, and we are delighted to retain them in Crystal City for another 15 years. We will relocate the Marshals from 1750 Crystal Drive, just down the street to 1215 South Clark Street.","By moving the Marshals from their existing location, we freed up more valuable space to lease at an excellent property that is on top of the Metro with excellent views. At 1215 South Clark, the building we're moving the Marshals, is being vacated this quarter by Boeing upon the completion of Boeing's new owned headquarters in Crystal City. I should say that this is a really good game of musical chairs for us, and we accomplished several goals with the Marshals lease.","It resolves Boeing's pending expiration in its entirety before they even vacate. We retain a large important agency in Crystal City. And we re-leased another 60,000 square feet that was vacated by BRAC. And speaking of BRAC, in Crystal City we have now resolved over 1 million of the 1.4 million square feet of BRAC space, and overall we have now resolved nearly 64% of the original 2.4 million square feet of BRAC vacancy.","Secondly, in 2014 we enjoyed the continuing influx of associations and nonprofits into Crystal City. DC has long been a hub for associations and nonprofits seeking proximity to Capitol Hill. We have successfully positioned Crystal City as a great alternative for these groups.","The combination of Metro, proximity to Capitol Hill, adjacency to Reagan National Airport, an abundance of hotels, and our wide cadre of amenities, have made Crystal City the location of choice for over 40 associations and nonprofits. And as tenants, in general, continue to focus on efficiency and productivity, Crystal City is proving to be a great value for tenants who want to trade up in space. We see this especially with the association and nonprofit sector.","So in 2014, we completed 190,000 square feet in new and renewal deals with associations and nonprofits. Included in this number is the new 78,000 square foot headquarters lease with the American Diabetes Association at 2451 Crystal Drive, who will move in later this year. And finally, as we talked about all year, 2014 was an important time for attracting innovation to our portfolio.","We completed a total of 248,000 square feet of leasing with WeWork. As they have done in New York and other markets, WeWork has quickly established themselves as a brand leader in DC. Their new 83,000 square foot office presence at our 1875 Connecticut Avenue building is their largest location in Washington.","The first 44,000 square feet opened at the end of 2014, the space looks terrific, and they're already 90% full, and work has begun on the additional 39,000 square feet. And in Crystal City, we\u2019re busy renovating a 165,000 square foot building for WeWork's residential concept, which is scheduled to open later this year.","Over the past year, we brought a new creative community to Crystal City that is really starting to gain traction. The Crystal Tech Fund is now a central gathering spot for Washington's tech community. TechShop has over 1,000 members, and you'll see inventors and artists there at all hours of the day and night.","Eastern Foundry, our incubator for government contracting tech, opened their doors in December and is already planning for expansion. Highline, a new community-inspired bar and restaurant, opened last week in the heart of Crystal City. Highline is the latest brainchild and 25th restaurant concept of Bedrock, leading restaurateurs, who have proven successful in attracting crowds to their other well-known DC locations. With its hip industrial design, Highline has opened to great press and enthusiastic customers.","Today, in Crystal City you'll find young creatives and millennials clustering in our parks and dining street side at our cafes. Crowds of entrepreneurs gather regularly for pitch events and networking. The kind of vibrancy we described last year at this time, is really now palpable, and we've only scratched the surface. We are exploring ideas big and small that involve creative partners, different kind of users, and new ways to invigorate our Crystal City. We are changing the fabric of Crystal City, and it's pretty exciting stuff.","In adjacent Pentagon City, our 699-unit apartment project The Bartlett and Whole Foods, is now vertical, we just poured the fourth floor, with delivery on track for mid-2016. As we have said, this project will be a game changer for both Crystal City and Pentagon City.","We continue to create value in our portfolio of downtown, as well. We will be demolishing two older contiguous buildings, where we will develop our new 335,000 square foot, corner trophy office building, 1700 M Street. The building will be located right off Connecticut Avenue, in the heart of the central business district. We expect to begin construction in early 2016.","So in summary, 2015 will be another year of hard work and opportunity. We're excited and ready to go. I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q & A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Bilerman. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","Manny Korchman is on with me as well. Steve, in your opening comments, you've mentioned the easy money has been made, it's time to basically continue to harvest, rather than invest. You also talked a little about getting a lot of enquiries on Chicago and San Francisco. And I'm just curious, as you think about dispositions and harvesting, where does the pipeline stand today? And how should - maybe I'm making more making more and tying those two comments about Chicago and San Francisco harvesting. Maybe I'm making too much about that but curious where that stands today.","Steven Roth","In Chicago, we believe we have very robust value creating opportunity as we transform the building to the, actually the most important tech center between the two coasts. And so that building is, we've got work to do. We have great visibility into the value creation. We think it will be significant. I'm talking about significant even in the scale of the $35 billion, $40 billion Company.","So that building is as I just said, in San Francisco, San Francisco is arguably the hottest market in the country right now. We own the best building in town. The rents are going up. It's extraordinarily successful. And it is obviously extremely sought after, by the world's aggressive investors.","So other than that remark, I don't think I'll go any further in talking about that. We are delighted to own it. It's a very valuable asset.","Michael Bilerman","And then as you think about the pipeline of assets to harvest, I don't know if there's a current bucket of dollars that we should be thinking about, just tying back to your comment about time to harvest more.","Steven Roth","Michael, we've sold in the recent past, over the last couple of years, $5 billion or more of assets that we really - we thought were better to be sold and the cash redeployed. We are - we own very few assets now that we have scrubbed the portfolio, that we are not happy owning. So there will not be any wholesale sales or activities. The heavy lifting of scrubbing the portfolio and focusing the portfolio is done.","Now having said that, we have enormous profits in almost all of our buildings and so the punch line to that is, we may from time-to-time respond to an opportunity. We may from time-to-time decide we want to swap out of an existing asset, realize profit and buy a new asset, but there's no - I'm not going to give you any number and there's no wholesale activity that is ongoing at the present time.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. And then it\u2019s my last question, in terms of --.","Steven Roth","The point of my comment is this. this is a time to be very careful with the euphoria of the marketplace and making acquisitions at very, very high pricing. It's time to be very rigorous from the acquisition side.","Michael Bilerman","Understood. My last question was just, and I recognize it's very early and the success will be deemed in terms of the Urban Edge spin off by what Jeff and his team will eventually do, and the increased focus between the two companies. But I'm just curious as, can you evaluate success at all in terms of the values that were put on both companies?","And how does that change your thinking at all about potential others to more strategic separations, either street retail New York, D.C. versus New York, has that accelerated or not, any of your thinking based on how the spin-off has been completed?","Steven Roth","You are full of interesting questions today. A couple of comments on that. The first thing is a couple years ago, in my Chairman's letter, I included a section that was followed by the industry and analysts closely, which basically was entitled, \u201cWe Will\u201d. And the key thing in that section was that everything is on the table to create value, and to be rigorously financial. That discipline if you will, or that objective or goal is still extant.","So we look at our portfolio of assets all the time. We have a grand portfolio of assets. I made the bold statement in my opening remarks that we think the private market value of our assets is greater than the stock market is valuing it at, which is fine. So we've got enormous values in our street retail businesses, an enormous future, if you have the patience, in our Washington business.","We've got - when David was making remarks about the Amazon building and saying that we created enormous value, I wanted him to put in there that we created a five bagger. And conservative David wouldn't say that, so we created a five bagger there. And we've got multiple 10 baggers in our portfolio, so we've got a lot that we can harvest. There's a lot that we can do, and we're not going to --","So we look at all of that, all the time with no commitments. We have a fine business. We've scrubbed it down. We focused it well so that we are very happy with it. And so that anything that we might do in the future would be offensive as opposed to some of the things that we did over the last 2.5 years, which were clearly defensive.","Operator","Our next question is from John Bejjani. Your line is open.","John Bejjani","Steve or David, can you give us an update on where Vornado stands in the approval process, or whatever the process is right now for selling 220 Central Park South units?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is the approval process is a hair away from completed. It\u2019s basically complete.","John Bejjani","And related to that, given the U.S. dollar's strength lately, are you seeing, or do you anticipate seeing any slowdown in foreign demand for condos there?","Steven Roth","I don't know. We have begun to expose the property very gingerly to presales, and to friends and family kind of activity, which has been robust. Although not wholesome, because until we get into the actual process, the public will not be invited in and that has been robust, including all manner of friends and family from all over the world. But I'm talking about small numbers, so not a sampling that one would extrapolate.","We intend to open the sales office for the property in late summer, and that's our timing. The observation that I have is that the capital sources from around the world, notwithstanding the strong dollar, are anxious to move their capital into the United States for lots of different economic reasons, and also because most people seem to think if you look at the interest rate cycle, that the strong dollar is going to get even stronger.","So the answer is, I'm really - I don't want to play the role of an economist. I'm a pragmatist and a player, and we'll let the marketplace tell us what to expect. I will tell you, with respect to this asset that we intend to, and are creating, I believe, I am certain, the best apartment house that has ever been created.","I'm talking about post-war, something in the last 50 or 60 years, building that has ever been created in New York. It has some unbelievably interesting features, including a motor court, and all kinds of different things, which people are very excited about, and so I suspect it's going to be very successful.","Having said that, as I've said before. We don't do condos, which are ordinary income for sale. That's not our business. We do one every dozen years. The last one we did was the Bloomberg Tower, which was enormously successful. But as I've said before, the apartments that we sold a dozen years ago are now selling at 4X, which drives David and me just bloody crazy as you can imagine.","So that's not a business that we are in, and so this is an interesting thing. We will do very well with it. It will create enormous franchise value for our firm, but so to speak, it's sort of a sideline. It's an important sideline but it's a sideline.","John Bejjani","Thanks for that. I guess on a related note on the currency exchange issue, industry retail portfolio, do you expect any deceleration in tenant sales growth, given the fewer dollars tourists will have to spend?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is I am always looking over my shoulder for the next problem, and the next problem after that. I read the same reports that you do, which says basically that tourism and the dollar's strength will slow down tourism, even in New York. There's a slight sign of that in hotel bookings, so that's an early warning sign. Just slight, a tiny little bit. And we'll see.","Our strategy with respect to our stores is, is to charge fair rents. We are able to charge fair rents because we own our properties at very attractive basis. And so we're not in the gouging business, and we will be very happy to get the rents that our retail customers can afford to pay us. We will do very well with that. And as I said before, we are getting very cautious on high-priced acquisitions, whether it be retail or office or whatever.","John Bejjani","All right, thanks. One last question for Steve Theriot, the guidance for 2015 D.C EBITDA growth being flat, I assume that's on a GAAP basis? Can you share a ballpark estimate on a cash basis?","Stephen Theriot","No, John. We don't have a cash estimate that we're going to publish.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb. Your line is open.","Alex Goldfarb","Steve, because you brought up 555 California, I just want to go back to that. As you look at the market, there\u2019s obviously a trade-off between maximization of the NOI versus today's cap rates that people are willing to pay. So you were pretty clear in your comments that Merch Mart has a lot more - there's a lot more activity to go there, before you would contemplate something. It sounded a little open-ended on 555, as though maybe you would be willing to part with it sooner, if someone threw out just an unreal number. So can you clarify how we should think about 555?","Steven Roth","Think about it as if it's an grand asset in Vornado's permanent portfolio until that fact changes. Hang on. Let me say it again. A grand asset embedded in Vornado's portfolio that we're delighted to own, until something happens where we change that.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay. So before, whereas you guys had been vocal about the need to do some leasing before you would contemplate something, it sounds like if the opportunity arose head of that, you would seize that opportunity?","Steven Roth","I'm not going to respond to that. You are putting words in my mouth.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay. Let me ask this question for David. Obviously, you have had a huge amount of success with TAMI. It's impressive, the amount of TAMI leasing that you guys have done. As you think about buildings, especially where you have some meaningful vacancy, is it changing the way you think about which tenants to respond to, from proposals, as like do you want to go more tech and TAMI, or as long as it's a good, healthy credit, you are willing to put them in space?","Just trying to understand it, because it sounds like there's a benefit, obviously, of having a WeWork or Facebook , etcetera, maybe that drives higher rents, in which case you may turn down some tenants that in a regular market you wouldn't? So just, sort of curious how you're thinking about leasing space.","David Greenbaum","I guess the first thing I would say is we don't have any real vacant space. So as we look at our portfolio, we're looking at the renewals that are coming up each year. Obviously, the simplest thing to do is to renew a tenant in place, if we can. To the extent we have vacant space in the building, I think to some extent, it's the building that does dictate the nature of the tenancy.","So if you think about what I said, as it relates to 280 Park Avenue, 280 Park Avenue is a financial services building. And of the 700,000 square feet that we leased in that building, I don't have the perfect statistic in front of me, but I would tell you 100% of that was related to basically financial services tenants.","So listen, from our point of view, we are looking for the right tenant for the right building, and most importantly, the tenant that's got credit, and that's prepared to pay the highest price.","We are seeing, in some instances we are having multiple offers on properties, which again reflects what I said earlier, as we are trending toward a landlord's marketplace. We do focus on credit. And we are focusing on maximizing value in any particular asset.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay. And then just finally --","Steven Roth","Alex I would, I would let me add a couple things to that. Number one, I am unbelievably proud of our team. We identified that in this cycle, the financial services side was going to come out of this thing slowly, which they have. And that the tech TAMI creative class was going to come out roaring, which they have.","So David and his gang, first of all, we own, unlike some other owners in town, we own a handful of buildings that are actually perfect for financial services, but we also own more than a handful of buildings which David has tailored for these new creative tenants. So 770 Broadway being a perfect one, the building that Amazon, just took and over and over and over again. So we were ready for this. That's the first thing.","The second thing is so let me tell you what happens. Okay? A financial services tenant, they go out and they take a year, and an RFP and all kinds of stuff to make a decision and whatever. David did a deal with Facebook . They came into town, they were looking for a New York headquarters.","They surveyed the marketplace in one week. They made a decision in one day, and they signed the lease seven days later. And then, they quadrupled the size of the space they have in the building. So they're quick, they're decisive, they're young, they're happy. And they are growing enormously.","So we benefit enormously from having a portfolio that has the ability to service both these kinds of tenants. We love them both. In terms of whatever, we're an equal opportunity landlord. We want the space filled with thriving tenants.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay. And then just finally for Mitch, you mentioned that the Marshals space is a relocation, and you said they're giving back more valuable space. Can you just provide some framework around what the difference is between building the space what they're leaving and what the potential mark of that space could be?","Mitchell Schear","Sure. So they've been in a building that's literally sitting at 18th and Crystal Drive for 15 years. So when they move out of that building, we'll do some freshening up of the building. But what you've got is a building that's literally located right on top of the Metro. So it's at ground zero in Crystal City.","And then the building fronts on Crystal Drive, so it's looking right out over National Airport into the District, so you've got a building right there with a great location, great views. So we think that, that will be an attractive space for a single user, multiple users, to backfill that space as soon as we get it back.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Guinee. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Steve, if I didn't know better, I would think you actually enjoyed these calls. Question, these are curiosity questions, first, Amazon building, 470,000 square feet, mid-block building 40,000 square foot floor plates, old department store. What fulfillment center what works for them? Is this a through building, with a frontage on 35th Street also? Or does this only have the frontage on the south side?","Steven Roth","It's a through block building, with an enormous loading facility which serviced the department store when it was built on 35th Street. With respect to their operating philosophy, etcetera, we would refer you to them. We're just delighted to have a landlord-tenant relationship with them. They're operating businesses - we are awed by their business, and let me leave it at that.","I would tell you that David and Glen and our teams did an amazing job in servicing this customer. This was a very big thing for them, because they hadn't done it before. And this deal came together quickly, efficiently on both, on the part of Amazon teams and the part of the Vornado, David and Glen and their team, so we couldn't be more happy with the deal, and proud to be their landlord.","David Greenbaum","I'll just add one thing to that, and that is they were so anxious to get up and running before the end of the year, that we actually through our construction and development team ended up helping them build out the fulfillment centers, so even though these guys were quote, rookies to New York, they got it done quickly, we got it done overnight, and could get them into operation.","Steven Roth","And that comment, John is typical of what our leasing operations does with all tenants, whatever assistance we can give a tenant to make the process because that's not their business, moving and building out spaces, whatever we can do to assist a tenant, whether they be a large tenant or a small tenant, we will do.","John Guinee","Great. Okay. Question for Mitchell. Department of Labor, Department of Justice, US Marshal, I think, correct me if I'm wrong, those are all GSA driven leases. Did those tenants expand, keep the same amount of space, or did they downsize?","Mitchell Schear","So we want to take - let's just take them in order. So the Department of Labor is a similar size relocation, and it's new business in Crystal City moving from Roselyn in Arlington as well. The Department of Justice in Skyline is a pretty much close to same square footage renewal. And then the Marshals service is ultimately going to reduce their footprint, which is their long-term plan by about 10%, although they have overhanging leases with us.","For example there\u2019s one 40,000-foot block that goes out until 2019. So whether the GSA occupies that space or the Marshals, that space will continue to be under lease for us in addition to the 371,000 square foot headquarters, and they'll ultimately reduce that footprint by about 10%.","John Guinee","Okay. And then also for Mitchell, if you look at the two buildings you're demolishing in order to build a new building, 1700 M Street. When you do the math, what are you valuing the land or the demolished building? What are you thinking as you're in total development cost when you run your numerous pro forma\u2019s on the deal?","Mitchell Schear","So I think that what you're looking at is a land basis in the $250 to $300 per FAR range. You're looking at an all-in cost to deliver the building in the $700 and $750 range, including all the carry that we include, our own Vornado carry as well as TIs and whatnot, so you end up with a trophy asset at a pretty solid basis, when all is said and done.","John Guinee","And is the $250 to $300, the existing buildings should be worth more than those kind of numbers, shouldn't they?","Mitchell Schear","If they were filled in income producing, you would probably be slightly higher than that, yes.","John Guinee","And then the last question, Skyline, 20\/20 hindsight, why did you guys even stay in the building? I thought you - that project, I thought you had the ability to just give it back to the lender. Is there some long-term opportunities that doesn't seem to be apparent right now?","Mitchell Schear","It is a non-recourse loan, so obviously implied in that statement is that we could give it back. There are significant tax costs of giving it back. So that's step one. Step two is what we did in light of that, was we restructured the - Wendy Silverstein who runs Capital Markets for us, did that, led the team that data that. We restructured the loan creating an A note and a B note kind of structure, where we were able to reduce the interest rate, extend the term of the loan.","And basically create a long-term option to the recovery of that asset. So that's what our strategy has been. It's a valid strategy. The cost of carrying that asset is actually small in relation to the size of the assets. And that's what our strategy has been. Now, in today's market it is an underappreciated asset, but when the water rises, all boats will rise.","Operator","Our next question is from Jamie Feldman. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Steve, I want to go back to your comment where you said this is the time in the cycle when smart guys build cash. I know you said we are at historic high prices, but what do you think actually could break here in terms of underwriting? Are cap rates too low, and as rates rise they move? Is leverage too high? Are underwriting assumptions to aggressive? Where do you see the cracks here?","Steven Roth ","I have my own ideas as what might happen, but they're not for publication. What I know is, when you've seen lots of cycles as I have, something's going to happen. It might be something that's predictable. It might be something that's not predictable. Who knows? The important thing is that - by the way, I'm not calling a market tough.","What I'm saying is, this is the time to be cautious, to be rigorous, acquisition prices are getting very high, and it looks like it's dicey to me. So what I'm saying is that we have a responsibility for a great amount of shareholder wealth, so we have a responsibility to be cautious at this point in the cycle. And that's all that I'm saying.","I'm not going to predict or I'm not going to call us up. I'm not going to predict what's going to happen, but I am saying that somewhere, and by the way I don't think it's imminent. It's not imminent. This thing has more time to go for sure. But it's rather than buy an overpriced building or keep another $600 million in our jeans, I'd rather do that. Okay?","So the incremental money that we might make by stretching to do an overpriced acquisition pales in with respect to the risk and the safety and we're preparing ourselves to be an aggressive buyer when the markets are more to our liking.","So I'm not calling a top, not by any means. This market has more to go for sure. And I'm not predicting what's going to happen. All I'm saying is that experience and caution dictates we should start to prepare for the next part of the cycle.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. That's very helpful. Would you put street retail in that category as well?","Steven Roth","We have pushed away from what we thought were overpriced or too high-priced acquisitions. One very, very prominent one recently. And the answer to that is sure.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then I recognize from your last answer.","Steven Roth","By the way, we get feedback on the street retail almost instantaneously, because our tenants say we can't pay the rent. So what I'm saying basically is there has to be - the answer to your question is yes.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And I recognize you're not calling a top or any kind of downturn here, but just bigger picture, you guys have certainly moved into tech in a big way with great success. When you guys are underwriting these tenants, how do you think about the risk in an eventual downturn? And how it differs from your traditional office space?","Steven Roth","I think Facebook is going to be just fine. I think Amazon is just going to be just fine. I think Bloomberg is going to be just fine. I mean, these tenants are huge now. We think Google is going to be better than just fine. So we are attracting tenants who are the who's who. And they are the who's who from a financial position point of view. So the answer to that is, these guys are inheriting the earth. And so, we're just very happy with it. By the way, we are not religious about this. When the financial services guys start to expand, we are going to be all over those.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Do you have a maximum NOI percentage for tech, or you'll just see where the opportunities are?","Steven Roth","Google and Facebook and the like could rent the whole portfolio. I'll be fine. These guys are hundreds of - I'm not understanding the question, Jamie because these guys are really, really big and secure, and they have infinite credit from my point of view and David's even more rigorous than I am. They have infinite credit from his point of view.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. That's helpful. Finally for David, I appreciate your comments on potential for rent growth if we get more job growth in New York. Do you care to make a guess here on what kind of market rent growth we could actually see in New York this year?","David Greenbaum","I know you want me to give you a specific percentage. I think I'm going to shy away from that, but I will reemphasize what I said earlier. Which is that with the vacancy rate now, hovering in the low 9% range, where we in fact brought the vacancy rate down by about 160, 150 BPs over the last year, we really have reached, I think, the beginnings of what we're seeing a landlord's market. If you reflect back a couple of years ago, we've seen pretty enormous rent growth in certain sectors of the market.","So as you look at a 770 Broadway, a number of years ago, if somebody said to me were we going to be doing triple digit deals in 770 Broadway? Obviously the answer would've been no. So I do think market-wide, while we've seen pockets in the city of some explosive rent growth, I think we're going to see market-wide, that rent growth begin to accelerate one area where we've also seen some significant rent growth, which obviously we love is Penn Plaza.","Steven Roth","So let me hop on top of the Penn Plaza comment with a little bit of a plug for our Company because it's near and dear to our heart. So in terms of rising rents, there are two sources. One is the market rises, and because of supply-demand characteristics etcetera, and we benefit from that, but the second thing is, we influence those markets by changing buildings, by changing tenant experiences, by changing tenant perceptions, by changing even neighborhoods.","And so what we are about and up to our eyeballs in the Penn Plaza district, which had in the past been the low-price provider in the office market, is to make - and now by the way, it's a funnel where everything is coming together, and meaning that Chelsea's coming north, the Hudson Yards is coming from West, Park Avenue South and Midtown South is coming from the east, etcetera.","And so we're about, as a Company, making those buildings, so that - and we've got lots of tech in those buildings, so that the rents that people are happy to pay for those properties is rising even more aggressively, or more rapidly than the market.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And just to follow-up on that you had commented about internal development projects. Does that mean you're getting ready to start financing a larger scale redevelopment at Penn Plaza?","Steven Roth","No. What I said in my remarks well the answer is yes to that, but what I said in my remarks was that we spent the better part of $0.5 billion this year on internal developments, which are more than 10 or 12 of them, couple of them larger, couple of them smaller.","All of which will cost when they're done, maybe $2 billion, and that's just the natural evolution - and that's higher earning capital, because we earn more on those controlled internal developments than we do going out and buying an office building at a sub-4 cap rate.","So that's everything that we've been doing, including the 220 job, including the Marriott 1535 job. And a dozen like it. Including why isn't that a 700-unit apartment house, why is it 699?","So I mean that's our whole development program for this year and we do $500 million or $1 billion worth of development every year.","Operator","Our next question is from Brad Burke. Your line is open.","Brad Burke","Just a couple quick ones for me and sticking with Penn Plaza, I was hoping you could give us an update on how you're thinking about the development opportunity at the hotel Penn site, whether you're thinking about proceeding with that at any time in the near future?","Steven Roth","The answer is, and I've said this over the years. The markets are ebbing and flowing over there, our aspirations, if you would have talked to David and I and our team some years ago, for the Penn Plaza district business, we would renovate or raise whichever the Hotel Pennsylvania, and that would be enough.","Our aspirations have now grown enormously so that the way we look at it, we have a one, two, three, four block square little sub neighborhood, or actually large sub neighborhood, and what we're about is to improve the whole district. The Hotel Penn is important, but not the main event.","The main event is to get the office buildings so that they command higher market ranch than they do currently. And by the way, they are rising with the marketplace, quite smartly, currently. So we're not prepared to commit to what our plan for the Hotel Pennsylvania is.","We are considering options which go from A to Z, including demolishing it to renovating it to turning it into - to combining it with the Manhattan Mall behind. I know it's been a long time in the making, but we're really committed to, we are not able to comment today as to what our eventual development plan will be.","We are working very hard, really hard, up to our eyeballs in the plans to transform the entire district.","Brad Burke","Okay. I appreciate that. And then I'll ask the third question today, on 555 California. I don't know if you would entertain a hypothetical, but if you were to divest that asset, does it make sense for you to also look at selling the other big asset in that partnership, 1290 Avenue the Americas, or should we not think about these things as being related at all?","Steven Roth","I'm actually going to - I half-ducked the question twice. I'm going to duck it a third time. Basically, they're two different assets. One is in the heart of our homeland, and we did an amazing job of redeveloping that asset and re-letting, as David said in his remarks. And that asset has - both these assets have appreciation. And beyond that, I'm not going to comment.","Brad Burke","Okay. That's fair. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vance Edelson. Your line is open.","Vance Edelson","It sounds like the frothiness for street retail market pricing has likely turned you off to acquiring anything with a significant retail component. And feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on that. But then turning to the office side, market prices where they are, can you give us a feel for whether acquisitions are still a possibility, and whether you'd branch out? Would you look for more opportunities like Long Island City, that are a little bit more off the beaten path?","Steven Roth","Okay, Vance. A couple of things. Number one, we have a $35 billion corpus here. And so we rise and fall by the increase in value of our $35 billion of corpus. So when we get up in the morning, the first thing that we say is okay, how are we going to make our existing assets that we own better, more valuable and harvest the values out of them? So if we do $1 billion of acquisitions in a year, which gets a lot of attention because it's glamorous and it's interesting.","That really is - it pales into what we can do, and the value we can create on the existing portfolio. So that\u2019s step number one. Step number two is we are trolling our markets every single day with multiple very talented people, and with deal flow, which we believe is second to nobody in the marketplace.","Looking at every asset that becomes available or leaving no stone unturned. So even though we think that prices are high, we continue to look at everything, searching for the one gem that will be - because we don't have an open to buy for 25 assets a year. We are open to buy for a handful of assets a year.","So we look at everything, especially street retail, because it's complicated, it's dense and somebody could be selling us something that they believe is described as ABC, and we may be buying something that we see as XYZ. So the answer is we are trolling these markets, and prospecting every day in all of the markets that we deal in.","And the answer is, everyone is an individual case. So we are doing some development now with even smallish assets, 61 Ninth, which is an unbelievably sexy asset in the meatpacking, adjacent to the Apple Store and across the Street from Google's headquarters, and it's smallish, and we're doing it because it's an asset that will be in great demand by our tech customers and our TAMI customers. So we leave no stone unturned. We have no blanket rule about acquisitions.","Vance Edelson","Okay. That's very helpful. And then David, you\u2019d mentioned being in conversations with multiple potential customers for the signage at 1535 Broadway, if I heard you correctly. Is that viewed as being in addition to the two top and bottom anchor tenants? Or would that be more of a replacement down the road? In other words, how much can you take advantage of the multiple configurations, and how you see the divvying up of the sign eventually settling out?","David Greenbaum","We think it's likely that the sign will be - the lower portion of the sign effectively will be directed with the tenant leases. So similar to what T-Mobile did, where they took effectively the portion of the sign directly over their storefront, on Broadway, wrapping on 46th Street. The upper portion of the sign likely is going to remain effectively third-party advertising. As I said there, Beats has committed to that sign for the entire 12 months of this year.","Steven Roth","The strategy with respect to that enormous, actually very popular, and now famous sign is pretty simple, as David described. The bottom half will go on long-term lease, presumably to the tenants that rent the space. So it's like the tanker market. Okay? So that's long-term lease. The upper half will be in the spot market for rent, to the entire advertising community. On a week-to-week, month-to-month year-to-year basis, whatever the market tells us to do.","Vance Edelson","Okay. And then just related to that, can you take that expertise you developed at 1535 to the Crowne Plaza, and help to ramp the signage income there? Do you think there's any upside potential?","Operator","[Technical Difficulty]","Participants, please stand by. Your speakers will be back shortly.","Steven Roth","I guess we're back. We don't know why we were dropped. We had some technical difficulties, which we apologize for. And so we'll continue the call for another five minutes, if people want to continue to ask questions. Thank you.","David Greenbaum","Vance, were you done with your questions?","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Chao. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao","Hey guys my questions been answered. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question is from Michael Bilerman. Your line is open. ","Manny Korchman ","It's actually Manny here with Michael. Steve, just going back to your previous comment on the re-financings that are going to get you to the $2.0 billion cash balance you mentioned the St Regis retail refi. If you just give us some details there, I didn't think there was any debt that had come with the deal, but maybe I was wrong on that. And then you had mentioned additional refi, if you could give us some details on what that might be?","Steven Roth","The big picture is that we will build cash from the normal ebb and flow of our business this year, from three sources as Steve Theriot described. The first source is, we will be closing the Springfield Town Center transfer to REIT at the end of March. And that will be $350 million or $360 million of cash coming in from the sale of that asset. That doesn't include the stock portion that we will get for the sale of that asset.","By the way, the stock portion has a 25% appreciation from the time we struck the deal. So that's $360 million. We will finance the St Regis retail. Right now it is un-financed. And that was - so we will finance that for $350 million or $400 million or whatever the detail is, we are in the process of scoping that out now.","And then we are doing in the normal course a refi of one of our other Manhattan assets, and the sum total of it will be more than $1 billion. So that's - I think that's from 30,000 feet, the details of what's happening there. Three separate sources, each one significant, multi-hundreds of millions of dollars in the normal ebb and flow of our business, no extraordinary transaction.","Operator","Our next question is from John Guinee. Your line is open.","Erin Aslakson","It\u2019s actually Erin Aslakson. I think our questions have been answered.","Cathy Creswell","That's it.","Steven Roth","No more?","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Steven Roth","For those of you who are still left, we apologize for the technical glitch. And so thanks for joining the call. And we'll see you at the next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"21963":["Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) Q3 2014 Earnings Call November  4, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Catherine Creswell - ","Steven Roth - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Executive Committee","Stephen W.

My name is Larisa, and I will be your operator for today's call. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions]","I'll now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Catherine Creswell","Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust third quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our third quarter earnings release and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents as well as our supplemental financial information package are available on our website, www.vno.com, under the Investor Relations section. In these documents and during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, Form 10-Q and financial supplement. Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

Also in the room are Wendy Silverstein and Michael Franco, Executive Vice President, Co-heads of Acquisitions and Capital Markets; and Joseph Macnow, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Administrative Officer. I will now turn the call over to Stephen Roth.","Steven Roth","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's third quarter call. It's election day across America. As I hope everyone knows by now, we are committed to running a focused business, and we have made remarkable progress toward that end.","We had a strong third quarter, and I'm very pleased with our financial results. Our third quarter comparable FFO was $1.31 per share, 6.5% higher than last year's third quarter. The increase is actually a much higher 12% after adjusting for a $12.1 million onetime unusually large lease termination fee in last year's third quarter from a single tenant at 1290 Avenue of the Americas. We have lease terminations every quarter but this one is unusually distorted because of the size and, therefore, we call it out for you. Our spin-off of the retail strips and malls is on schedule and is expected to be completed as of the end of the year, subject to SEC approval. In September, we filed Amendment 1 to the Form 10. SpinCo will be named Urban Edge Properties and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol UE. Jeff Olson, Chairman and CEO of Urban Edge Properties started on September 1. Trustees will include: Jeff Olson; myself; Steve Gutman, former longtime CEO of Federal Realty who put together most of Federal's portfolio; Michael Gould, former longtime CEO of Bloomingdale's; and Kevin O'Shea, CFO of Avalon Bay. Several more trustees will be named shortly. We are truly excited about UE's prospects.","Now to recent acquisitions. We made 3 investments during the quarter. The joint venture in which we are a 50% partner entered into a 99-year ground lease for 61 Ninth Avenue on the Southwest Corner of Ninth Avenue and 15th Street in the heart of the Meatpacking District adjacent to the Apple Store and Chelsea Market and across from 111 Eighth Avenue, Google's 3 million square-foot New York headquarters building. This will be a ground-up newbuild 130,000 square-foot office building with retail at the base tailored towards creative class tenants. We also acquired the land under our 715 Lexington Avenue retail building for $63 million, and we acquired a small retail property on Canal Street.","A few days ago, and this will show as a fourth quarter activity, we closed on our previously announced purchase of the St. Regis retail for $700 million. We own approximately 75% of the joint venture, which owns this property. The property has 100 feet of frontage on Fifth Avenue, on the Southeast corner of 55th Street in the heart of the area of Fifth Avenue, favored by the world's luxury retailers. We also own 689 Fifth Avenue on the same block. The St. Regis property is bookended to the south by the high-fashion Valentino flagship and to the north by the 40,000 square foot Polo flagship, both are new stores, which opened within the last 2 months. The property has a 17,100 square-foot lease with Gucci, a division of Kering, for its Bottega Veneta brand through January 2016 and a 7,600 square-foot lease with LVHM for its DeBeers brand through January 2019. Yesterday, we announced the sale of 1740 Broadway for $605 million, which will be used in a like-kind exchange for this property. I will talk more about 1740 Broadway in a minute.","Now on to dispositions. In July, we completed the sale of Beverly Connection for $260 million. In addition, our fund and its 50% partners sold the 213,000 square-foot shops at Georgetown Park for $272 million. Our development leasing teams totally transformed what was a distressed multilevel mall in the heart of Georgetown. The IRR on Vornado's investment -- Vornado's share of this investment was 45%. Further, we sold 2 of the 20 small non-Manhattan retail assets that do not fit in UE's strategy for $15 million, and we have commitments to sell 4 more.","We have just entered into an agreement to sell 1740 Broadway, a 6,100-square-foot office building in Manhattan. The sales price is $605 million or $1,000 per square foot. The financial statement gains here on the sale will be approximately $43 million. The tax gain will be approximately $483 million, which will be deferred in a like-kind exchange for the acquisition of the St. Regis Fifth Avenue retail, which I previously mentioned. We currently have over $300 million on the for-sale list. This list excludes the transfer of Springfield Town Center to PREIT, which will be completed in the first quarter of 2015 for $465 million. Springfield celebrated its grand opening just 2 weeks ago. Initial reviews are outstanding, and tenants are reporting sales well over their projections. Our work at Springfield is largely done now.","Our pipeline of internal value-creating opportunities is robust, including our Supertall 220 Central Park South residential condominium tower is now under construction. Next, our dominant retail and signage transformation at the Marriott Marquis at the bulls-eye of the Times Square bow tie across the street from our 1540 Broadway full block of retail and signage. This enormous sign, which we believe, at 330 lineal feet by 8 stories tall, is the largest anywhere, is being tested now and will go live on November 18. The first advertiser will be a giant tech firm. By the way, we have a very significant portfolio of science concentrated in Times Square and in Penn Plaza. We don't know anybody who has a bigger or better portfolio of size. Next, our pipeline includes our 1.1 million square-foot redevelopments at 330 West 34th Street and at 7 West 34th Street, which are nearing completion and targeted to the creative class market, a recurring theme. Next, the substantially completed transformation of the 1.2 million square-foot 280 Park Avenue in partnership with our friends at SL Green. This 2-building complex has a full block lobby on Park Avenue, which is now open and a second quite imposing west lobby, which will open in a few weeks. Leasing is going well here. Our direct next-door neighbor here is JPMorgan's world headquarters at 270 Park Avenue. The have just announced that after much analysis, they will be staying on Park Avenue right next to us.","Next, the spectacular 44,000-square-foot Top Shop 4-level flagship at our 608 Fifth Avenue, which will open at noon tomorrow. Next, our 699-unit rental residential project in Pentagon City named The Bartlett, with Whole Foods at the base is now going vertical. We own 2 adjacent approved land parcels here for another 1,400 residential units. Note that we already own and operate 2,414 rental apartment units in Washington, which -- so this new project will be added to the portfolio. Next, Wayne Towne Center at Wayne, New Jersey at the intersection of Route 46 and Route 80 is about 60% complete. Costco just opened. Dick's Sporting goods will open in 2 weeks. Next, our Alexander's affiliate. We are constructing 300-unit apartment tower on top of the 6,000-square-foot Rego 2 shopping center located at the Long Island Expressway and Queens Boulevard. This 20-story building is now topped out and has really, really cool views of the Manhattan skyline. And all this is in addition to our grand plans in the Penn Plaza District. As David will mention shortly, our large and important New York office portfolio is full, with rents or new leases clicking along at high teens mark-to-market. Demand from investors worldwide for our kinds of New York real estate is robust. In fact, demand in pricing is the strongest we have ever seen.","At quarter end, we have $4.3 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.9 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $2.4 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. On the first day of the fourth quarter, we used $450 million of cash to pay off the 7 7\/8% unsecured notes due in 2039.","Now over to leasing. Company-wide, in the quarter, we leased 1,684,000 square feet in 132 transactions, with positive mark-to-markets at 8.0% cash and 7.9% GAAP. In New York, we leased 589,000 square feet for the quarter and 2.8 million square feet for the first 3 quarters of the year. We continue to be very constructive on the New York Office market, submarket-by-submarket. As I have said before, the island of Manhattan is tilting slowly to the south and to the west, greatly [indiscernible] to the benefit of the Penn Plaza District where we are the dominant owner, with over 9 million square feet of office and retail space and the Hotel Pennsylvania. Our New York business continues to put up very strong industry-leading metrics.","In Washington, our efforts to be competitive and aggressive to retain tenants and fill vacant space is beginning to pay off. During the quarter, we leased 450,000 square feet of office space in 44 transactions. We leased 1.2 million square feet for the year to-date. Washington office occupancy, excluding Skyline, is at 87.1%, up 170 basis points from year end. As I've said before, we believe there is no value in our stock price for the vacancy in Washington.","To sum it up, I'm very pleased with both our operating performance and our progress on focusing the business. As my final comment, I will observe that pricing in the private markets is substantially higher than pricing in the public markets.","Now I'll turn it over to CFO, Steve Theriot, to cover more details of our financial results.","Stephen W. Theriot","Thank you, Steve. Yesterday, we reported third quarter comparable FFO of $1.31 per share, up from $1.23 in the prior year's third quarter, a 6.5% increase. But as Steve just mentioned, the increase actually much higher, 12%, after adjusting for the $12.1 million lease termination fee in last year's third quarter. We normally don't call a lease termination fee income onetimers, but this one was unusually large and, therefore, distortive. And like what we did in last year's third quarter call, when this fee was initially recognized, we are highlighting this item. Including non-comparable items, total third quarter FFO was $1.15 as compared to $1.12 in the prior year's third quarter. I will discuss this quarter's non-comparable FFO items in a minute.","Third quarter comparable EBITDA was $426.4 million. Our New York business produced $250.6 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, ahead of last year's third quarter by 1%. But after adjusting for the $12.1 million lease termination fee I just mentioned, the increase is 5.7%. Our Washington business produced $83.7 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, lower than last year's third quarter by $3.2 million or 3.7%. Washington's year-to-date comparable EBITDA is 252 -- $252.7 million, lower than last year's 9 months by $5.3 million or 2%. We expect Washington's 2014 full year comparable EBITDA will be approximately $5 million to $10 million, lower than 2013, an improvement from our prior guidance of between $10 million and $15 million. More than offsetting the expected decline in comparable EBITDA, we realized a reduction in interest expense of $16 million in 2014 from the restructuring of the Skyline mortgage loan. Net-net, we expect our Washington segment's contribution to comparable FFO to be between $6 million and $11 million, ahead of last year. Our retail strips and malls business produced $54.7 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter and generated a same-store EBITDA increase of 1.1% or 1.8% on a cash basis over last year's third quarter. Focusing just on the Urban Edge portfolio to be spun off at year-end, the same-store EBITDA increased 1.3% or 2.9% on a cash basis. We leased 243,000 square feet at the strip center -- strip shopping centers with a positive mark-to-market of 12.7% GAAP and 7.8% cash. We leased 25,000 square feet at our 4 malls, substantially, all of which, was first-generation space. Occupancy for the strip centers was 94.5% at quarter end, up 60 basis points from the second quarter. Occupancy for the malls was 95.5%, up 10 basis points from the second quarter.","Now to non-comparable FFO items. These items aggregated a negative $32.8 million or $0.16 per share of loss from the quarter compared to a negative $22.9 million or $0.11 per share of loss for the third quarter last year. This year's third quarter non-comparable items include $7.1 million of acquisition and transaction costs, primarily related to the spin-off of Urban Edge Properties; a $10.3 million noncash impairment loss in loan loss reserve on our investment in Suffolk Downs; negative FFO from Toys of $18 million. By the way, the carrying amount of our investment in Toys is 0 at quarter end. These items are partially offset by $2.7 million of gains on sales of residential condominiums. Please see our press release or the overview and MD&A on Page 37 of our Form 10-Q for a complete summary of non-comparable items.","Now turning to capital markets. As Steve mentioned, we have $4.3 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.9 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, and $2.4 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. In the fourth quarter, we used $445 million of cash to repay the 7 7\/8% unsecured notes due in 2039, and we used some cash to see Urban Edge when it is spun off at year-end. We also intend to repay the $500 million of 4 1\/4% senior unsecured notes due in April 2015, when they first become freely prepayable in January 2015.","In July, we completed a $130 million financing of the Las Catalinas Mall in Puerto Rico, the 10-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 4.43% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in year 6. In August, we have completed a $185 million financing of the previously unencumbered universal buildings, a 690,000-square-foot 2-building office complex located in the Dupont Circle submarket of Washington, D.C. As Mitchell will tell you shortly, we work just open here. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 190 basis points and matures in 2019, with 2 1-year extension options. The loan amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in the fourth year. In September, we obtained a standby commitment for up to $5 million of 5-year mezzanine loan financing to fund a portion of development expenditures of our 220 Central Park south luxury residential condominium tower.","In October, we renewed and extended 2 of our -- or 1 of our two $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities. The renewed credit facility matures in November of 2018, with two 6-month extension options. The interest rate on the extended facility was lowered from LIBOR plus 125 basis points to LIBOR plus 105 basis points. In addition, the facility fee was reduced from 25 to 20 points. Our other $1.25 billion revolving credit facility matures in June 2017, with two 6-month extension options. Our 2 revolving credit facilities total $2.5 billion.","In October, we completed a $140 million financing of 655 Fifth Avenue, a 57,500-square-foot property, whose tenant is Ferragamo. The loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 140 basis points and matures in October 2019, with two 1-year extension options. Our consolidated debt-to-enterprise value is 33.6% based on the quarter end stock price of 99.96, and our consolidated debt-to-EBITDA is 6.8x. Our debt mix is balanced with fixed-rate debt accounting for 85% of the total with a weighted average rate of 4.56% and a weighted average term of 6.3 years and floating debt accounted for 15% of the total, with a current weighted average interest rate of 2.23% and a weighted average term of 4.1 years. We have no remaining 2014 maturities. And after giving effect to the repayment of our 4 1\/4% senior unsecured notes in January, our 2015 maturities totaled just $244.3 million.","Steven Roth","Steve, I want to jump back in. I misspoke in describing the financial numbers of the important 1740 Broadway sales, so let me correct my mistake. We're selling 1740 Broadway, which is a 601,000-square-foot office building, and the sales price is $605 million, $1,000 a foot. The financial statement gain on the sale will be $443 million, not $43 million that I said. $443 million financial statement gain. The tax gain will be approximately $483 million. So the sales price is $605 million. It's $1,000 a foot. The financial statement gain will be approximately $443 million. The tax gain is approximately $483 million. I apologize. David?","David R. Greenbaum","Steve, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Before I turn to our results for the quarter, I'll spend a few minutes on the market. New York City office using employment has now approached its all-time peak reached in 2001. And with that, Manhattan office vacancy rates have now fallen below 10% to 9.7%, the lowest level since 2008. Not quite a landlord's market but we are getting there. This job growth has continue to be achieved without the benefit of the traditional drivers of growth: large financial services and law firms. The creative industries have fueled much of the growth with the TAMI sector, technology, advertising, media, information, continuing to increase its share of leasing activity Manhattan, with TAMI tenants committing to more than 6.6 million square feet through the third quarter, some 33% of the total leasing activity, up from 25% last year. As tenants have been shifting their focus from the cost-cutting mindset of the past few years to a focus on top line growth, tenant relocations, spurred by the quest for efficiency, has also been an important trend in the market in 2014, with the 14 of the top 20 leases being for new space as compared to only 5 of 20 last year. And we have seen the same trend in our own portfolio. We have completed major new headquarters leases with Neuberger Berman at 1296 Avenue and New York and Co., Yodle and Deutsche Advertising all at 230 West 34th Street.","Leasing velocity continues to be brisk, some 25-plus million square feet year-to-date, over 30% higher than the same time last year, with net absorption in the 4 million to 6 million square foot range depending upon the brokerage report through the first 3 quarters of this year equal to the absorption achieved for all of last year. The high-end financial services firms have also been very active in the marketplace this year, continuing to lease great space in trophy assets. In our own portfolio in the third quarter, in 280 Park, 640 Fifth Avenue and 888 Seventh Avenue, we closed 6 deals, a total of 67,000 square feet with average starting rents over $110 per square foot. I think one of the brokerage firms captured the view of the marketplace perfectly, describing it as, \"on a roll,\" highlighting a recent report by the Brooking Institute naming New York as the top destination for foreign college students and newly minted foreign professionals. New York has been and continues to be the magnet for talent. The business climate of New York feels very robust.","Let me now focus on Vornado's performance. In the third quarter, in the office sector, we signed 29 leases for a total of 556,000 square feet of activity, taking our leasing through the third quarter to over 2.7 million square feet. For the quarter, we completed 30%, 3 of the top 10 largest leasing transactions in Manhattan. Our average starting rent was a healthy $68.44 with very strong positive mark-to-market of 17.9% cash and 12.6% GAAP. The average lease term was 9.7 years. Our tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions per square foot per annum were somewhat elevated this quarter at 12.5% of starting rents. This was attributable to the mix of leases we executed this quarter, with over 70% of our leasing with new tenants and only 30% being renewals.","As expected, our third quarter occupancy tipped down by about 70 basis points to 96.6%, reflecting the Citibank move out of our 50%-owned 666 Fifth Avenue. Our office expirations for 2015 are quite modest, with only 1 million square feet coming up. Importantly, our pipeline of deals, and for that purpose, we consider our pipeline to be actual leases in documentation, is extraordinarily active. We have leases out for over 1.2 million square feet.","Let me now talk about a couple of highlights in our third quarter leasing activity. At 330 West 34th Street, at our redevelopment, we signed 2 leases for a total of 158,000 square feet, 1 with Yodle, an online marketing company and the other with Deutsche Advertising, coming out of 111 Eighth Avenue, the Google building. Deutsche is part of the InterPublic Group of advertising companies. We have established an enormous relationship with IPG over the past 2 years, bringing the CMGRP to 9093 Avenue and also expanding the draft FCB space at 100 West 33rd Street. We now have over 800,000 square feet with IPG. At 1290 Sixth Avenue, we renewed our lease with WENNER MEDIA, the publisher of Rolling Stone magazine for 99,000 square feet. And so our State Street Bank expand by over 22,000 square feet to a total of 128,000 square feet. At One Penn Plaza, we renewed United Healthcare's lease of 61,000 square feet. At 90 Park Avenue, where we are now commencing and working on our building redevelopment program similar to the activities we've undertaken, time and time again improving assets. We're putting in state-of-the-art mechanical systems, elevators, with a total lobby transformation. At 90 Park, we leased 14,000 square feet of the Guggenheim Foundation and year-to-date, we have now leased 200,000 square feet of the 450,000 square feet, which is scheduled to expire over the next 2 years at substantially higher rents. And finally, at 280 Park Avenue during the quarter, we signed 3 leases for a total of over 75,000 square feet and currently are in negotiations with a major financial services firm for 125,000 square feet at the base of the building.","With a dramatic mid-block H&M space about to open, I encourage you to walk into the new 280 Park Avenue. Our renovation program will be complete prior to year end. Not reflected, importantly, in this quarter's leasing activity was a major lease we signed with Google for 180,000 square feet in the 630,000 square-foot building at 85 Tenth Avenue. This building is a premier asset in West Chelsea between the Chelsea Market and the High Line right on the Hudson River waterfront between the 15th and 16th streets. We have a mezz loan on this asset and effectively own 50% of the equity. The building, by the way, is a block away from 61 Ninth, where we announced our joint venture, in which we are a 50% partner, just having entered into a 99-year ground lease with plans to construct, as Steve mentioned, an office building with retail at the base of approximately 130,000 square feet.","Let me now turn to Manhattan Street Retail. For the quarter, we executed 8 retail leases aggregating 33,000 square feet with positive mark-to-markets of 41.8% cash and 53.4% GAAP. In the bow tie in Times Square, at 1535 Broadway, the Marriott Marquis full block front, 45th to 46th Street directly across our 1540 Broadway, the world's largest 10k LED sign will be going live the evening of November 18. We will be celebrating with a launch event, and we would be delighted to have you join us. Please let me know. We are in active discussions with many tenants for retail stores, and one of the world's premier digital advertisers has made the first commitment to the sign, all 330 linear feet 8 stories high. At 608 Fifth Avenue, Topshop will be opening their new 44,000-square-foot Fifth Avenue flagship at noon on November 5.","Let me now turn over to San Francisco, the best office market in the country, where we continued our strong leasing activity at the iconic 1.8 million square feet 555 California Street. This building's tenant roster includes financial giants: KKR, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Dodge & Cox, UBS and Bank of America; national law firms: Kirkland and Ellis, Jones Day, Sidley and Austin and Fenwick and West; consultants: McKinsey & Company; and technology companies, which we brought into the building over the past year: Microsoft and Supercell. This building could well be the best tenant roster in America.","In the third quarter, we signed 3 leases totaling 178,000 square feet, and we are now poised to sign and as additional lease for 122,000 square feet within days. With this activity, year-to-date, we have completed over 500,000 square feet of leases at 555 California at very strong rents, with cash mark-to-markets of positive 21.7% and GAAP mark-to-markets of 28.4%.","Let me now turn to The Mart. At The Mart, a 3.5 million-square-foot building, which was highlighted with a cover story by Cranes of Chicago, as being be epicenter of the white hot River North Market, we continued the transformation of this building into a home for technology-based tenants and have rebranded the asset, The Mart, dropping merchandise from the name. We completed 123,000 square feet of office leasing activity this quarter, including 50,000 square feet with Yelp, a 20,000-square-foot expansion with the Chicago Entrepreneurial Center known as 1871, taking their occupancy to 76,000 square feet of incubator space and a 25,000-square-foot lease with a bioscience incubator known as Matter. Last Thursday, Lenovo completed its purchase of Motorola Mobility from Google with Mayor Rahm Emanuel hosting an event at The Mart to welcome Lenovo to Chicago. Notwithstanding the sale, Google, of course, remains the guarantor of the entire lease obligation.","To conclude my remarks, let me summarize the entire New York division. We had a very strong quarter, with same-store EBITDA increases to the overall division of 5.2% cash and 4.6% GAAP. For the 9 months year-to-date, our same-store EBITDA increases for the overall division have been 7.4% cash and 5.3% GAAP. Isolating just the New York Office business, our same-store increases for the quarter were 4.1% cash and 3.1% GAAP and for the 9 months year-to-date, our same-store increases have been 7.3% cash and 5.3% GAAP.","I'll now turn the call over to Mitchell to cover Washington.","Mitchell N. Schear","Thank you, David, and good morning, everybody. In Washington, we are pleased with leasing velocity, which is showing some signs of life, and we are capturing more than our share of that activity. We are doggedly determined to be competitive and aggressive to keep our existing tenants and bring new ones to fill vacant space. In the quarter, we completed 472,000 square feet of office and retail leases in 52 transactions. Altogether, thus far in 2014, we have signed leases for 1.2 million square feet of office and retail space in 167 transactions. Important to note, of this 1.2 million square feet, more than half, or 678,000 square feet, is new leasing. With about 60 leases currently being negotiated for more than 1.1 million square feet of new leases and renewals, we expect a very active end of 2014 and beginning of 2015. And we are out ahead of our 2015 contractual expirations, which total about 1.95 million square feet. We are in lease with 607,000 square feet, expect to renew another 486,000 square feet, plan to take 153,000 square feet out of service for redevelopment and will extend 350,000 square feet into 2016 on a short-term basis. Altogether, these numbers total about 1.6 million square feet or about 82% of our 1.95 million square feet of 2015 expirations.","Overall, office leases signed in the third quarter generated a GAAP mark-to-market of negative 2.7% and a cash mark-to-market of negative 7.3%. Not great metrics, but producing the leasing velocity we need. We expect this trend to continue, given the ongoing competitive leasing market in Washington. Our total occupancy, including residential was 83.4%, down slightly by 10 basis points from Q2, which is way down by Skyline's declining occupancy. Skyline was 53.2% at Q3, down 520 basis points from 58.5% at Q2. Excluding Skyline, our overall occupancy increased by 85 basis points to 89.2%, and office-only occupancy increased by 130 basis points to 87.1%, with a strong upticks in our Downtown D.C. portfolio, which was up 2.2% and in Crystal City, where we were up 1.8%. Our residential business continues to maintain a 97% occupancy for Q3. We own more than 2,400 apartments in highly sought after urban locations including Crystal City, Pentagon City, Roslyn and Georgetown. In addition, 699 apartments and the new Whole Foods are currently under construction at the Bartlett in Pentagon City. We are almost at grade and are on schedule to deliver in mid-2016. In addition, we own the 2 sites adjacent to the Bartlett where we can build another 1,400 residential units. Quarter-over-quarter, we reported same-store EBITDA of negative 4.1% cash negative 2.7% GAAP. These numbers are influenced by onetime leasing fee we earned in Q3 2013, and this was for the large early renewal of Sidley Austin at The Investment Building. Without this onetimer, both GAAP and cash same-store EBITDA numbers would have been flattish.","This quarter, we enjoyed healthy government activity. Signed during the quarter were 191,000 square feet of government leases, about half the total leasing completed in the quarter. Of the government leasing, 116,000 square feet of that was new leasing, and 75,000 square feet were renewals. At the beginning of the year, we said we expected the D.C. division EBITDA to be down $10 million to $15 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Three quarters of the year through, we are down $5.3 million and so we now know we will be better than guidance.","We continue to work to attract creative and tech tenants to Crystal City, and we are gaining momentum. In the past 7 months, we've had over 8,000 people come to Crystal City for creative tech events and to experience the creative hub taking shape. And more than 40 recent press stories have been generated about innovation in Crystal City. We continue to entice more accelerator incubator types and to draw a new demographic to the area. Just last week, we finalized a deal with Eastern Foundry, an incubator and co-working space specifically for small technology businesses focused on government contracting. Their new headquarters will create natural synergies with large Crystal City contractors like Lockheed, SAIC, Booz Allen, while adding to our innovation hub. In partnership with WeWork, we will deliver a new residential concept in the latter part of 2015 that will add another layer of edgy creativity to Crystal City. With community-style apartments featuring imaginative design and connected to dynamic shared social spaces, WeWork will bring the same sense of community and opportunities for collaboration to residential as their office concept. And speaking of WeWork, just yesterday, they opened their doors in our 1875 Connecticut Avenue building in Dupont Circle, unveiling 44,000 square feet of their latest co-working offices. In addition, we just signed a deal with them to take another full floor in the building, which will about doubled their office leasing with us.","On October 17, I was delighted to help cut the ribbon at our new 1.4 million square foot Springfield Town Center. The energy and enthusiasm was palpable, as thousands of shoppers lined up to experience the new center. Our Vornado team did a terrific job, transforming the property into an -- a regional shopping center, with many of the very best brands, including Topshop, who made their debut in Washington market here at Springfield. In these first few opening weeks, retailers are reporting impressive sales, the parking lots are full, and there's a great deal of buzz in the market. All in all, we're very proud of the results, and I certainly encourage you to come by to check it out.","In summary, we think the tide is slowly turning in the Washington metropolitan region. We remain optimistic and excited about our many opportunities to create value by leasing up our vacancy and harvesting our vast development pipeline on the shores of Potomac. Thank you very much. And I now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manny Korchman [ph] from Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Michael Bilerman, here with Manny. Stephen, I heard from the comments you talked about a sale list but unfortunately, I didn't hear the amounts. I didn't know if I heard millions or billions. And I was wondering if you can review a little bit about sort of what's on target. And how do you envision recycling proceeds, whether it'll be more around 131. [ph] Or taking cash and distributing it to shareholders if there's another large gain like you had with 1740.","Steven Roth","The for-sale list currently is over $300 million. I know that we have sold approximately $4 billion over the last couple of years, trimming off our portfolio, getting out of noncore assets and the like. We review our portfolio continuously, for both acquisitions, and in this case, dispositions. And while we currently have in the marketplace over $300 million, that does not mean that we will not sell more over time. We have the luxury of that almost all of our assets had gains in them. Most of them, very, very large gains, and so that's a good thing. And how we handle those gains varies from case to case. So we have over $300 million in assets now, although, that's not just a positive number and we're certainly are not finished. We have the concept of pruning, and selling assets is a continuous event.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then as a follow-up, in your opening comments, you reiterated the D.C. comment that it's better to be soft today you don't think that there's much -- any value for the vacancy in the upside over time. The stock is at 110, it's up a few bucks over the year. I think if you think back to the stock performance, how much of that was a move in the market in terms of the value of assets in the marketplace, in terms of cap rates compressing? Or was there other things that you think were undervalued and there still remains another piece? Just talk a little bit about sort of reiterating that comment with the movement in the stock.","Steven Roth","Oh, God. The stock market is all-knowing and all right, and I can't deem to predict or comment on the stock market's activity. I mean, it's very clear that several years ago, we were grossly undervalued for lots of different reasons, which we set about to fix. And I think, we've done a remarkable job in doing that, and we're pleased with the recognition the stock market has given us. But we ain't done yet by a long shot, and so we think the stock continues to be undervalued, and we will continue to put up the numbers and show results and expect that the stock will follow.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Peterson from Sandler O'Neill.","Ryan Peterson","I just wanted to ask if you guys would consider selling a stake in 555 California, given that the current pricing for CD office has been strong and the fact that people have shown a willingness in San Francisco to pay ahead for upside. It seems like it might be an opportunity to recognize a portion of that upside now.","Steven Roth","The answer to that is we consider what the right financial strategy is with all of our assets every day. And obviously, everyday is not literal. Every quarter, we are continuously evaluating. We have thought about that asset. We continue to cherish that asset. It is probably the best asset in California, and its performance now it's spiking. So we think about it, although, it is not currently for sale.","Ryan Peterson","Okay. And then one other question, just if you guys could provide any details on the rate or terms of mezz financing for 222 Central Park South.","Steven Roth","The interest rate is in the high-high single digits. That's a standby commitment, which we -- which is available to us. It's up to $500 million. It will permit that project to self-finance and self-finance with no recourse to the parent, and the interest rate is very close to a double-digit interest rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs.","Bradley K. Burke - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On Washington, D.C, as I look at the expirations for 2015, they seem to be getting bigger, not smaller. So I'm wondering how much the leasing you've done on Washington, how much of that is related to shorter-term extensions. And I'm not sure if this is related, but as I look at your EBITDA to date for Washington, D.C., you continue to track above that $10 million to $15 million decline that you originally guided us towards. So I'm wondering whether some of this expected decline has been pushed forward into 2015.","Steven Roth","Mitchell, do you want to comment on the -- please comment on the vacancies, and I'll take the guidance question.","Mitchell N. Schear","Sure. Brad, on the -- with respect to the 2015 expirations, I went through that in some detail on my comments. But we have 1.95 million square feet, and the business is lumpy, so different properties have different lease expirations, different years. So the 1.95 million just happens to be how those leases come up. And I think I accounted for 82% of them, in terms of being renewed, being extended and whatnot. Would you like any further color on that?","Bradley K. Burke - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, and I appreciate the detail on the 2015 expirations, but I was asking more about the 1.2 million square feet that you have leased thus far in Washington, D.C. for 2014. How much of that is shorter-term extension in nature that would be causing the 2015 expirations to increase?","Mitchell N. Schear","Oh, I see. So there will be very little of the 2014 activity that would have any impact on adding square footage to 2015.","Steven Roth","Brad, on the guidance question, with respect Washington that you asked, we had guided to EBITDA being down $10 million to $15 million this quarter. Yesterday, I guess, it is, we adjusted that guidance. We approved that guidance to down $5 million to $10 million. We are hopeful that we will come in at the low end of that number, so that's an improvement. The reason for the change in guidance is improved operating results in the business, so that's a good thing. I would remind you that we have pointed out in our filings that if you just take the interest savings alone from the Skyline loan, so while our EBITDA will be down, our FFO will be improved by virtue of the fact that the interest savings exceeds the decline in EBITDA. So I hope that answers your question.","Bradley K. Burke - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then the second one, just on the real estate fund, now that you sold a couple of the larger assets, can you give us an update on how you're thinking about the remaining assets within this fund? Whether you might be looking to sell those in the near to intermediate term.","Steven Roth","We're actually very pleased with the financial results of the fund. Actually, quite, quite pleased. I don't really want to comment on the timing of those sales. There's not a lot of assets in there. Some of the assets are better held for a little bit longer term. So obviously, everything that's in the fund will be sold over the intermediate term. And with respect to the specific timing of those sales, it's not something that I think we're ready to get into right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Real quick question, both for Mitchell and, I guess, Steve. You continue to talk about The Street not giving you credit for the vacancy, Crystal City, Skyline. So 2 questions. One is, if you're buying vacancy in Crystal City, what will you pay for that in a per-square-foot basis if you are a buyer? And then, second, is there any economics for you at all-in Skyline? Or has that all been essentially taken by the lenders?","Steven Roth","John, we're not -- I'm not criticizing the stock market's valuation machine, with respect to it. I'm just making the observation that the way I do the math, when you buy a share of Vornado stock, you get x numbers of square feet of empty space in Washington for free. And I think that, that may be appropriate. So I guess, I would answer your question what would we pay for the empty space, the vacant space in Washington, something more than 0, actually, probably, something substantially more than 0. But that's not the main event. The main event is to not look at it as being distressed. The main event is for us to hunker down and lease that space, which may take us an X number of years and require a Y amount of capital, all of which is predictable, to get that space income-producing and then values will be quite substantial. So that's the way we will look at it. Basically, the space is worth more than 0, but nowhere near what it will be worth, when it is -- when it is becomes tenanted.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. We value it at $150 a square, and I'm just trying to figure out if that's a good number in your mind.","Steven Roth","We probably think it's a little more than that, but I mean, I'm not going to quibble with that number. And once again, it's not a big number in our entire enterprise, so there's, let's say, there's arguably 2 million square feet, that's not a correct number but it's directionally correct, the vacancy's there. So whether we would quibble with your number by $50 a foot, one way or the other, it's actually a pretty small number. So we're talking about dollars per share, one way or the other, in value. Not fives of dollars or tens of dollars. Now with respect to Skyline, which, for those of us who understand the market down there is obviously metro-deprived and, therefore, a more difficult submarket, which we admit. What we have created there is by restructuring the loan, we have created the ability to hold that asset for a very long period of time waiting for submarket for the market to turn and then, we will be able to -- as the market gets tighter, over time, which could take years, we believe that we will have better luck at leasing that space. So what we have done there is we have basically stretched the loan out, and also bifurcated the loan to allow us to put capital in releasing, leasing capital, as needed. We expect Skyline to be at the very end of the lease-up program in Washington.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Perfect, okay. So there is some value to, essentially, your preferred position, but it's a long time in being monetized.","Steven Roth","We think that our -- the capital that we are in, in between the APs and the BPs, we think that dollar good. We don't think that's risk capital.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the 220 Central Park South just with respect to the activity you've been seeing over at Extell's project at 157? And just some commentary on the direction you think that ultra high-end market is going. Obviously, the press has been fascinated this year with the slowdown in sales activity over at 57.","Steven Roth","I'm not sure I heard all your question, Ross, but let me try and take a shot at it. So the first thing is that we are not yet in the market to sell product, although -- and we will probably enter the market in the first quarter of 2015. We have a very large and very robust list of incomings, which we sort of call, the friends and family list, of people who -- and they're largely domestic and largely New Yorkers, interestingly enough. Some non, some offshore people, whatever, who have basically heard about the building, seen some material on the building and are excited about the building and have inquired. And that does not include the real estate -- the residential real estate brokerage community, who, I am told, anecdotally every major broker has a small handful of people who are very anxious to get in and look at the building. So that's what we think is the state of the market. With respect to 157, which, I guess, was the building that started the market movement, they're down to cats and dogs there. They've sold all the good products, and they have some odds and ends left, and so it's not that all surprised that if they're having multiple price rises so the product is really expensive, having sold all the good products and being down to odds and ends, that sales are slowing, that's predictable.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I appreciate that. On a separate topic, is NYRT [ph] something that you guys are pursuing? Or is that not up your alley?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is we're not going to comment on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manny Korchman from Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, it's Mike Bilerman, back for Manny. So just a question, David, just in terms of the Marriott Marquis and the signage, I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about, looking at the existing signage income at Vornado it's up 10% year-over-year, but it was down 11% in the quarter. I didn't know if there was something funky last year or something this quarter. But as you think about the $450 million of total cost, how should we think about the income recognition heading into next year or the sign kicking off this November, in terms of the return for that capital for the Marriott? And I know there's still the -- I think you still have the lease out to host and I didn't know if that was something that you would trigger the buyout for next year, or you'd wait a little bit.","Steven Roth","A couple of things. Number one, we're really excited about this asset. It's a dominating asset. We now own both sides of the bow tie in Times Square, which is one of the top retail submarkets in town. When you go into Times Square, you can barely walk on the streets because it's so crowded. It's a tourist mecca, et cetera. It's also the entry to the theater district, so we're very happy with our position in Times Square. By the way, rents have appreciated in Times Square enormously, probably second only to Upper Fifth, so the -- and that's a result of a couple of things. Number one, the advent of conventional retail in Times Square is relatively new. So obviously, that is causing business to improve. The second thing is our stores in Times Square are open to 1:00 in the morning. So this is sort of different kind of -- it's an all-day all-night kind of retailing. The volumes are extraordinary, and so we're delighted with our position in Times Square. The -- we partnered with Marriott who owned the property. There is a buy -- we have an option to buy, they have an option to sell to us. Those options don't start to open up for some years now, so this is not an imminent thing. Our ability to buy is delayed, they have the first right to sell to us in a shorter time frame -- what is it, about the first fund is about 5 years from now.","Mitchell N. Schear","The first time is upon stabilization and there's certain time savings.","Steven Roth","So I mean, there are various sequences when they can sell to us, but we can't exercise our first buy for more than 10 years. So that's, that. We expect to have very high single digit returns on our capital investment in this asset, which means we expect to make a fair amount of money. We expect to do well with this asset, and we are very pleased.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Manny here. Steve, can you provide us an update at leasing on 640 Fifth? And maybe also comment on whether there's been any increased competition from 685 Fifth at GGP until recently [indiscernible]","Steven Roth","I couldn't hear the back half of your question, Manny.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Has there been any increased competition from 685 Fifth which Thor and GGP partnered up to buy?","Steven Roth","Well, first of all, there's -- we've done some leasing, office leasing in 640 Fifth. David, can you describe that? We've done some leasing there over $100 a foot.","David R. Greenbaum","Yes, two of the leases that we talked about north of the $100 leases. In fact, we're at -- the 640, that market, as it relates to the office in that building -- I mean, it's a great space overlooking the Channel Gardens, overlooking Saint Pat's, we're very optimistic about that space. A lot of the building was leased about 10 to 12 years ago. So a number of those leases, in fact, are coming up, and we think we have some very nice mark-to-markets in the office space.","Steven Roth","So the location of -- lease of the office space is a more bifurcated question into office and retail. So the location vis-a-vis office space is terrific. The quality of the glass box that we put on top of that base-free [ph] building 10 years ago or 12 years ago is first class, best in the city. And so we're getting triple-digit rents there, so we're very pleased with that. With respect to the retail, obviously, location is superb, and we are talking to multiple tenants about leasing the retail space in that -- in the retail segment of 640. With respect to competition, we compete with everybody, and so there is almost always -- tenants almost always have multiple choices, not just one choice, that's a very rare event. And so generally, there's 2 or 3 spots on the street that are available, and so we enjoy competition all the time, but there's enough for everybody. I believe, that with respect to the more northern part of Fifth Avenue, I'm talking in the high 50s, rather than the low 50s, where this 640 is, the pricing is even higher. So I'm not sure that we're going to be competing for the same tenants that would want to go on 55th Street versus 51st Street.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to Stephen Roth for closing remarks.","Steven Roth","Thank you, all, very much for listening and participating. Remember, it is election day. And we look forward to your participation on our fourth quarter earnings call, which is scheduled for Wednesday, February 18, in 2015. So have a good day, everybody.

Our speakers will address your questions at the end of the presentation during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations.","Cathy Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s first quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our first quarter earnings release and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents as well as our supplemental financial information package are available on our website, www.vno.com under the Investor Relations section. In these documents and during today\u2019s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, Form 10-Q and financial supplement.","Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our Form 10-K for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties.

Also in the room are Michael Franco, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer; and Joseph Macnow, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado\u2019s first quarter call. At Vornado, we have a treasure trove of great assets such as the Bank of America Tower in San Francisco the 3.7 million square foot Mart in Chicago, all of our office, residential, and development properties in Washington, a couple of billion dollars of cash and much more. But the main event here at Vornado is our New York office and our dominant New York street retail business. And that business having -- has industry-leading asset quality, is performing at very high levels and is growing like crazy. The growth here is organic. Most profitable climb coming from our existing assets where taxes and operating expenses are already baked in. So, that substantially all of each dollar of incremental revenue falls right to the bottom line.","And this growth requires us to spend only TIs and leasing commissions of say $100 per square foot, which is a small fraction of the capital required to buy or build in New York, which by course $1,000 or $1,500 or even $2,000 per square foot. And none of this growth is yet transparent to the market.","So, here\u2019s the math. Over the past two years, we did 7.1 million square feet at share of leasing in New York at theMART and at 555 California Street. 2.3 million, which is 2.3 million square feet higher than our two-year average. As of today from this leasing, we have $200 million plus of incremental additive cash NOI on deck, not yet in our numbers, which will be recognized between now and 2018 as follows: $41 million in the remainder of this year; a $120 million in 2017; and another $39 million in 2018, all from signed leases which have not yet commenced paying cash rent. The breakdown is a $123 million from New York office, $57 million from New York Street retail and 20 million from theMART and 555 California Street. These are not projections, all of this is from signed leases from tenants such as PwC at 90 Park Avenue, Neuberger Berman at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Facebook and AOL and Verizon at 770 Broadway, Amazon at 7 West 34th Street, Macy\u2019s at Eleven Penn, Footlocker and Structure Tone at 330 West 34th Street, Victoria\u2019s Secret at 640 Fifth Avenue, Swatch, Harry Winston at St. Regis, ConAgra at theMART and many, many others.","The equivalent GAAP increment that has yet to come into income over that period is $83 million. As you know GAAP rent recognition commences earlier than cash rent recognition due to free rent periods. Importantly, because NAV, the principal measure of value is calculated based on cash NOI, this additional $200 million increment will increase our NAV by a very meaningful $20 to $25 per share, depending upon the cap rate one uses. For those of you who are in the modeling business, our internal budget showed 2017 cash NOI from our New York office and Street retail plus theMART and 555 California is about $1.1 billion, give or take. As a point of reference, 2015 was $900 million, that\u2019s $1.1 billion in 2017 versus $900 million already booked in the year 2015. You should note that we will of course have leases that will expire during these periods and other leasing activity which could positively or negatively affect, both NOI and EBITDA.","Now, onto the quarter, our comparable FFO was $1.08 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.07 for last year\u2019s first quarter. Our New York business produced $14.9 million of comparable EBITDA growth or $0.08 per share even after being penalized by $5.1 million non-cash write-off or straight line rent receivable from early lease terminations we initiated to make way for replacement leases at 20 plus mark-to-markets. Excluding that straight line -- straight final write-off, growth was $20 million or $0.10 per share. The New York business produced a 5.5% same-store increase.","Focusing on the entire Company, the way we look at it, the Washington business declined by an expected $5 million of which negative $2.1 million is from increasing vacancy at Skyline and properties taken out of service and negative $2.9 million is from the core, all on track with our guidance. The fair value earnings of our real estate fund declined by $5.2 million quarter-over-quarter. As you know the fund is in harvest phase and continues to shrink, all on plan. And we are carrying $1.9 billion of cash, $900 million more than the prior year\u2019s quarter and that has a quarterly opportunity cost of say $0.05 per share. Adjusting for these items, our pro forma comparable FFO per share would have been $0.10 higher, a 9.3% increase from the prior year\u2019s quarter.","Now to other business, on April 22nd, a little over a week ago, we submitted two comprehensive proposals in response to the state\u2019s RFP and RFEI, one for the Farley building in partnership with the related companies at Skanska, and a second on our own for Penn Station. We welcome Governor Cuomo\u2019s spotlight on Penn Station and the Penn Plaza District. Were the early mover in Penn Plaza. We have accumulated 9 million square feet here in a very heart of Manhattan\u2019s New West Side. And as I have said repeatedly, Penn Plaza is Vornado\u2019s big Kahuna.","At 220 Central Park South, our for sale condo project traffic has ticked up in the sales room, benefitting from the rising building now being very clearly visible from Central Park and the calming of the financial -- the global financial markets. We continue to explore separating the Washington business and we have begun a process to dispose of the Skyline properties, which are subject to a $678 million mortgage loan. At our request, loan has been transferred to the special servicer. Consequently, based on our shortened estimated holding period, we\u2019ve recognized the $160.7 million non-cash impairment loss in this quarter.","Now to leasing, Company-wide in the first quarter we leased 1,403,000 square feet in 106 separate transactions. In New York, we leased 737,000 square feet of office space, at starting rents of $84.32 and positive mark-to-markets of 32.6% GAAP and 28.2% cash. Business in New York is really good.","And asset pricing in New York continues to set records. Here are two examples hot off the press. First, the 50th front foot Valentino flagship on Upper Avenue, mid block between 54th and 55th streets on the east side has just gone to contract to a European high net worth individual. We hear the prices $525 million, well through the $480 million asking price, which equates to $11.3 million per retail front foot. Vornado owns the balance of this block. Both sides of the mid block Valentino property including both quarters consisting of the St. Regis Retail\u2019s 100 front feet and 689 Fifth Avenue with 50 front feet, which gives us a total of a 150 front feet on this super premium block, which I guess, based upon the comp is now with for sure well over $1.5 billion. This sale certainly validates Upper Fifth Avenue values. Two years ago in my annual letter to shareholders pages 14 and 15, if you would like to look at up, I provided a numerical tour of Upper Fifth Avenue values. We own 20% of the retail frontage on Upper Fifth including stores for Victoria\u2019s Secret; Ferragamo; Swatch; Harry Winston; Mac Cosmetics; Massimo Dutti, Uniqlo Hollister et cetera.","The second recent sale of note the Sony building 550 Madison Avenue at 56th Street, coincidentally just behind the St. Regis, has also just got the contract to a high net worth Middle Eastern family for $1,800 a foot. The seller abandoned plans for a residential conversion. The building will be delivered vacant intended for high-end office use. These two noteworthy sales, both involving high net worth individuals, not countries, not sovereign wealth funds, not pension plans or the like further validate the strength of New York, the enormous liquidity in the marketplace and the global appeal of prime New York little state as the store of that. It\u2019s important to note that these two assets are very high quality. And by the way, I can\u2019t resist the plug. Our portfolio is filled with assets of equivalent value -- equivalent quality.","This is proxy season. Our Annual Shareholders Meeting is May 19th. This year we have modernized our governance to conform the best practices. Special thanks to Candace Beinecke, our Corporate Governance Committee Chair, who has led the charge here and has now taken on the additional responsibility of Lead Trustee. Thank you to Candace.","To sum it up, business is really good. We are excited to be putting growth numbers from our on deck leases and our highest priorities are to resolve Washington and to dig in and get to work in Penn Plaza.","Now over toe Steve Theriot.","Stephen Theriot","Thank you, Steve. Steve covered our financial results, so I will limit my comments to a couple of items. I want to highlight two items that will affect the quarterly comparison of our New York business growth in comparable EBITDA and FFO for the remainder of 2016.","First, in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015, we recognized $27 million of non-cash, non-recurring income from the acceleration of FAS 141 below market leases related to our early termination of the leases at the St. Regis retail property and the Crate and Barrel lease at 1650 Madison. Second, during the remainder of 2016, we will write off straight line rent receivable balances totaling $9.7 million triggered by our early termination of leases with J. Crew and Rocket Fuel which enabled us to sign new replacement leases for that space with mark-to-markets of 20% plus GAAP and cash. While the write-off of straight line rent receivable balances will reduce EBITDA in 2016, the new replacement leases are accretive from an economic perspective, increasing future EBITDA. Together, these two non-cash adjustments to recapture and re-let space at much higher rents will negatively affect the quarterly comparison of our growth in our New York business\u2019s comparable EBITDA and FFO in the second quarter of 2016 by $11.3 million, the third quarter by $12.5 million and the fourth quarter by $12.9 million. We reaffirm our guidance that comparable EBITDA from our Washington business for the full year 2016 will be $7 million to $11 million lower than 2015.","Now, turning to capital markets, in March, we completed a $300 million refinancing of One Park Avenue, a 947,000 square foot Manhattan office building in which we own a 55% interest. The five-year loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.75% with realized net proceeds of approximately $45 million. The property was previously encumbered by a 4.99% fixed rate $250 million loan.","In February, we completed a $700 million refinancing of 770 Broadway, a 1,158,000 square foot Manhattan office building. The five-year loan is interest only at LIBOR plus 1.75%, which was swapped for 4.5 years to a fixed rate of 2.56%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $330 million. The property was previously encumbered by a 5.65% fixed rate $353 million loan. Our remaining 2016 consolidated debt maturities are $709 million, consisting primarily of the $515 million Mart loans, which matures in December 2016.","Our share of partially owned entities\u2019 2016 debt maturities is $697 million, consisting primarily of $361 million at 280 Park Avenue and 161 million at the Warner Building. We are well along on these refinancings and expect to close the Warner Building refinancing in a couple of days.","Excluding the financing of our 220 Central Park South project which will self liquidate from signed sales contracts, our consolidated debt metrics are fixed rate accounted for 77% with a weighted average debt of 3.99% and a weighted average term of 4.8 years and floating rate debt accounted for 23% of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.18% and a weighted average term of 5.1 years. Debt to enterprise value is 31%, debt to EBITDA ratio is 7.5 times. Pro forma, excluding debt related to Skyline which was recently transferred to the special servicer and using say $1 billion of excess cash to reduce debt, our pro forma consolidated debt to EBITDA ratio strengthens to 6.3 times. In addition, including our share of partially on entities\u2019 debt excluding ToyotaRus, our pro forma total debt to EBITDA ratio calculated on the same basis increases to 7.0 times from 6.3 times.","In closing, Vornado has the fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and our maturities are well staggered. We have as of today $4.4 billion in liquidity which comprises of $1.9 billion of cash -- restricted cash and marketable securities and $2.5 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business.","David Greenbaum","Steve, thank you and good morning to all. On our year-end call, just 10 weeks ago, we took a deep dive into the Manhattan leasing environment and focused on private sector employment as well as office using employment, both of which ended 2015 at all time record highs. In the first quarter, Manhattan leasing market continued to perform well, as this city\u2019s highly diversified economy continues to create tenant demand across all industries and submarkets. Despite global volatility, the overall leasing market remains resilient with first quarter leasing volume of better than 8 million square feet, which included 10 large block transactions comprised of a balanced mix of financial services, TAMI and professional business services tenancies.","Asking rents in Midtown continue to increase quarter-over-quarter having now eclipsed the $80 per square foot mark. The overall availability rate continues to hover around 10%, importantly which includes sub let availability, which is now down to a nominal 1.5%, representing the lowest rate since the first quarter of 2008.","New York City\u2019s job growth continues to be solid in the first quarter of 2016 with total private sector employment growth of 24,200 jobs including 7,100 office using jobs, both on par with a string job creation we realized in 2015. And by the way, these are actual reported job growth numbers, not seasonally adjusted. As the Wall Street Journal recently reported, \u201cCompanies Flock to Cities with Top Talent.\u201d And New York continues to be a top magnet for top talent. I\u2019ll repeat what I said last quarter, business has been and remains very good.","Let me now turn to our own office portfolio. During the first quarter, we completed 737,000 square feet of leasing activity in 36 transactions. This quarter\u2019s average starting rents reached $84.32 per square foot with very strong positive mart-to-markets of 32.6% GAAP and 28.2% cash. I might add that even if you exclude one large lease extension we executed this quarter, our starting rents would still be over $79 per square foot and our mark-to-markets would be over 30% GAAP and 28% cash.","Our quarter ending office occupancy was 96.4%; we remain full. And reflecting on the city\u2019s continuing healthy job growth, I would note that of the 737,000 square feet we leased in the first quarter, 41% of the activity was comprised of tenants expanding their footprints in New York, in our case attributable to two significant leases, I\u2019ll talk it about in a minute, PwC, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Facebook.","In anticipation of the scheduled expiration of the space formally occupied by big pharma companies, Sterling Winthrop and Sanofi at 90 Park Avenue, during 2015, we completed a significant $70 million redevelopment of the building, which has been extremely well-received by the marketplace. As we reposition and transform buildings in our portfolio, time and time again, we successfully have attracted large credit headquarters tenants, Neuberger Berman at 1290 Sixth Avenue, Guggenheim in 330 Madison Avenue, Amazon in 7 West 34th Street, PJT Partners and Franklin Templeton Investments at 289 Park Avenue, Footlocker and Deutsch Advertising in 330 West 34th Street, Facebook and AOL, Verizon in 770 Broadway and on and on.","And this quarter\u2019s leasing highlight was our 241,000 square foot headquarters leased with PwC at 90 Park Avenue. PwC is the largest professional services firm in the world, and this new lease is pure expansion for PwC, creating a campus-like environment for its New York workforce in close proximity to its present office at 300 Madison Avenue. This was a competitive deal, and we are delighted that PwC selected 90 Park Avenue as its headquarters location in New York.","The transformation at 90 Park Avenue has totally modernized the infrastructure of this asset as well as dramatically reimagining the aesthetic of the building to attract both the millennial generation, note here that 80% of PwC\u2019s New York workforce are millennials as well as the more traditional financial services tenants. In this 950,000 square foot Class A property, in the past year, we have leased 540,000 square feet and have an additional lease out for signature of another 120,000 square feet, bringing the building to 93% occupancy, all at robust mark-to-markets of 25% GAAP and 20% cash.","We have now secured three major tenants in the building, PwC, FactSet, and national law firm Foley & Lardner along with a concentration of boutique financial services tenants will occupy the midrise and tower of the building including Nuveen, EverBank, Aegon and the Guggenheim Foundation.","Speaking to the quality of our New York portfolio, in the quarter, we continued to outperform the market, as it relates to deals of $100 per square foot or greater. We executed six leases this quarter, totaling 340,000 square feet with starting rents averaging $116 per square foot. Driving these numbers, Level 3 renewed at 60,000 square foot lease at 85 Tenth Avenue. Facebook added another 80,000 square feet at our 770 Broadway, where we were able to recapture a below market lease in order to satisfy Facebook\u2019s ever growing need for space. And Bloomberg extended its lease in the tower office floors at 731 Lexington Avenue to 2029 to be coterminous with its 700,000 square foot main lease.","In our retail portfolio, during the first quarter, we completed 38,000 square feet of leasing activity in seven transactions. The highlight of the quarter was our 20,000 square foot lease with Starbucks for its new reserve roastery and tasting room concept, which will be Starbucks\u2019 largest outlet in the world modeled on the concept store that debuted in the company\u2019s home town of Seattle two years ago. Even we were surprised by the worldwide business press this lease received. Looking for the perfect location to open the second outpost of its high-end brand, Starbucks after an extensive process selected our development site at 61 Ninth Avenue at 15th Street because of its close proximity to the Chelsea market, Google\u2019s offices, the Apple Store and the High Line.","We broke ground on the 61 Ninth development just a few weeks ago and we will be delivering the iconic 170,000 square foot building designed by Rafael Vi\u00f1oly by the end of the next year. The balance of our retail activities for the quarter was a series of small leases with positive mark-to-markets of 15.8% GAAP and 5% cash.","I\u2019m now going to turn to our activity in Penn Plaza where our efforts to reposition our massive holdings continue to pick up momentum this quarter. In our last call, we told you that we were optimistic that after our temporary experiment last year, we would receive approval to close a portion of 33rd Street between One Penn and Two Penn Plaza year round. In March, the community board voted unanimously to approve the closure and the city has now given us the green light to close this street indefinitely starting this summer. This is an important opportunity to improve the public realm in this area.","In addition to improving the public realm, we will invest in our holdings to upgrade them for today\u2019s tenants. In Steve\u2019s annual Chairman\u2019s letter, he included a link to renderings of a Bjarke Ingels design for Two Penn called the Skirt. Our intent here is to transform a good 48-year old building with its punched windows into a modern age building with new floor to ceiling glass curtain wall. The main event here is the massive undulating canopy; in spots, it will be 85 feet high and extend out 65 feet, which has been inspired by the iconic photograph of Marilyn Monroe standing over a subway grate. The statue will provide grand entrances for Penn Station, Madison Square Garden and our two Penn Plaza office building. We believe that this design will become world famous and in fact a symbol of New York.","Our transformation of the area is in the early stages, but you can already see the potential. As starting rents in one Penn Plaza for the quarter for nine leases, a mix of renewals and new leases covering 51,000 square feet was over a $71 per square foot, good but still well below what we believe the building can achieve, given its unmatched access to transportation and its location from the center of Manhattans new West Side. [Indiscernible] announced publicly that its location on the north side of the Long Island rail road concourse in Penn station is its best performing store in the country on a sales per square foot basis, we own that retail on the north side where we also just signed a lease with Shake Shack, and Magnolia Bakery recently opened.","Finally as Steve mentioned, April 22nd was the due date for the state\u2019s request for submissions for both the transformation of the Farley building and Penn Station itself. That morning Vornado submitted comprehensive proposals for both, and we believe we can play an important role in the transformation of this area into the gateway that New York deserves, a new empire state station complex. We welcome Governor Cuomo\u2019s focus on this area and know that with his involvement, great things are possible.","Let me now turn to theMart in Chicago, where our redevelopment of the communal areas on both the ground and the second floors is well underway with an anticipated completion this June. This transformation includes a grand stair connecting tenants and visitors from the ground floor entry of the building off river drive up to a new food and beverage experience overlooking the Chicago river along with our new urban food hall on the second floor which is within steps of the most active transit line in the city of Chicago which directly empties tenants and visitors into theMart. Continuing the trend of major corporations moving their headquarters into Downtown Chicago from the suburbs. Beam Suntory, the spirits company completed a 113,000 square foot sublease for Motor Mobility, adding another great brand name to our tenant roster. While we did not execute any significant direct leases in the first quarter, taking account of our very active 750,000 square feet of leasing activity in 2015, theMart same store numbers for the first quarter were a positive 11.3% gap and 25.1% cash.","A word about the hotel business in New York. While both domestic and international tourism remains strong, the hotel industry is in a down cycle, the victim of gross oversupply. The results of our Hotel Pennsylvania have been weak. We continue to look at this hotel as a parking lot for future development as part of our overall Penn Plaza strategy.","As I look at our entire business excluding the Hotel Pennsylvania, our New York same-store numbers for the first quarter were a positive 6% GAAP. As we noted on our yearend call, we anticipated that same-store growth in our New York business would be back to our historic and consistently strong levels, as in fact reflected in these quarter\u2019s numbers. While the cash same-store for the first quarter as expected was only a positive 1.7%, as the year continues and free rent periods burn off, we expect to realize cash same-store growth approaching double digit numbers in the second half of this year, and we will continue to see that strong cash same-store growth continue into 2017 as the massive amount of leasing we completed during 2014 and 2015 in both our office portfolio and our street retail business cycles into our cash NOI.","To conclude my remarks, the entire New York business had a very quarter. Strong same-store increase, strong leasing volume, strong average starting rent, strong and new creditworthy tenants and strong occupancy levels. Our 1.2 million square foot pipeline of leasing activity is robust with 475,000 square feet of leases in documentation and an additional 750,000 square feet of proposals we are negotiating. We are very constructive on the New York marketplace.","Thank you. And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mitchell to cover Washington.","Mitchell Schear","Thank you, David and good morning everybody. In Washington, story continues to be about recovery. In 2015, Washington added 68,000 jobs and the projection is about the same for this year. We seem to be on track thus for with 25,000 jobs added in the first quarter. The region\u2019s economy has diversified with job growth focusing professional services, IT, associations and advocacy groups, security tax and cyber and biotech. We should see this job growth translate into more robust office demand as the market continues to recover. The above average job growth is pushing the unemployment rate down to extremely low level, now at 4.1% for the region.","We believe that Washington, our nation\u2019s capital is a forever market that will continue to strengthen. In the first quarter of 2016, we completed 579,000 square feet of office and retail leases in 43 transactions. Office leases signed in the first quarter were flattish, generating a GAAP mark-to-market of negative 3.9% and a cash mark-to-market of negative 2.5%. Our first quarter TIs and leasing commissions were 7.8% of initial rent or $3.01 per square foot per annum, down from Q4, which was 11.5% or $5.06 per square foot per annum. Our overall occupancy was flat at 84.8%. Our office only occupancy excluding Skyline, increased by 60 basis points to 90.6%. Skyline declined to 47.4%. Our residential occupancy increased by 70 basis points to 96.8%.","In downtown Washington DC where we own approximately 3.2 million square feet of office space in 11 buildings that are now 96.8% leased, there are several highlights. At the Warner Building where we own 65% in a joint venture, we are finalizing our refinancing. We have largely released the 600,000 square foot landmark, currently to 88% to a great roster of high quality tenants that include Baker Botts, General Electric, Facebook, Hewlett-Packard, APCO Worldwide, Cooley, EMD Serono and The ONE Campaign.","Last week, Treasury\u2019s Office of Inspector General moved into our Bowen building at 875 15th Street occupying 58,400 square feet. Here, we have a prestigious agency who required a quality building close to the main Treasury building two blocks away. The move coincided precisely with the expiration of the previous tenant.","At the corner of 17th and M Streets, we are emptying tenants at the contiguous 1726 M Street and 1150 17th Street building to make way for our new 335,000 square foot Trophy Office building, 1700 M Street. Our plan is to begin demolition of these outdated buildings within the next 90 days and build the new garage and foundation back to grade while actively marketing the building. With the garage and foundation complete, this will put us in an excellent competitive position to go vertical when the time is right.","Across the Potomac, we are also continuing to make progress in Crystal City. We are actively replacing BRAC tenants with a wide array of associations and advocacy groups, professional services and creative companies. Our efforts to revitalize and energize neighborhood are at full speed and taking shape. A full page New York Times story that ran on Wednesday April 20th gave a good sense of the creative authentic community that\u2019s growing in Crystal City.","WeWork worked recently opened its first location in Northern Virginia in our building at 2221 South Clark Street in Crystal City. Here, we transformed an obsolete office building into a WeWork community that combines for the first time the exciting new residential concept with their proven co-working office space. The office space on the top two floors of the building and is now 85% occupied after only three months. The balance of the building includes WeLive, 216 new collaborative living community style apartments that officially opened yesterday to great response in press. This morning a Washington Post story described the new WeLive as a fresh take of what apartment life should be like. WeLive is bringing a whole new crowd to Crystal City and we are delighted to partner with them.","In adjacent Pentagon City, we have begun preleasing our new 699 units apartment project, The Bartlett. We are seeing strong activity, resulting in 125 units already leased at better than budgeted rents. We look forward to the first tenant moving in June, located directly atop a new Whole Foods, this 23-storey building has great view of DC and the best residential amenity package in town.","In addition to finishing and opening WeLive and The Bartlett, we\u2019re putting the final touches on our design for 1770 Crystal Drive. 1770 Crystal Drive is a 270,000 square foot building in the bull\u2019s eye location that we recaptured when we extended the U.S. Marshals and moved them down the street to another building of ours. Located right at the metro, the existing building will go out of service next year as well fully redevelop it with the new skin, new lobby, new system, and a top floor conference center for delivery in 2018. It will be our first good as new office product in Crystal City in a long time. We\u2019re excited about it and expecting great things from it. We will surround it with restaurants and entertainment, adding to the street vitality and heightening the urban experience of Crystal City.","And finally, we have a tremendous 8 million plus square foot development pipeline on land that we own outright for significant value creation. Included in that number is our 7.5 acre parcel in Rosslyn which we own in a joint venture, arguably the best beach front location in all of the Washington region. In March, we received long thought entitlement approval to build 2.5 million square feet of new office, residential, hotel and retail; clearly a big step forward in realizing the value of irreplaceable site.","I\u2019d like to thank you very much and I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Manny Korchman with Citigroup.","Manny Korchman","Steve, I appreciate the color on the $1.1 billion of NOI in 2017, but you seem to have overlooked DC when you were giving those numbers. Are we reading too much into it that DC will be out of Vornado my then or were you just waiting to talk about it later in your scripts?","Steven Roth","I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it. We were focusing on our New York segment, which is clearly the dominant segment in our business. Notwithstanding that we have said repeatedly and hinted that we are studying, analyzing separating Washington. So, while we are not announcing that and it may or may not happen, you could read into that whatever you care to.","Manny Korchman","And then David, how do you think about the new supply coming on in New York, especially with Sony coming back and that\u2019s sort of near term than people expected. Do you think we\u2019re about to head to a place where there\u2019s just too much supply?","David Greenbaum","I guess the first thing I would say is New York is a big city. So, if you think of the supply coming into that marketplace, 15 million square feet, 18 million square feet on an absolute number sounds like a very large number but as a percentage of the overall stock, what we\u2019re looking at is increasing the stock by in the 3%, 4% kind of range, which is going to be coming on line over the next really fourish plus years. So, as we look at historical absorption in the New York City marketplace, in a good year, we certainly can absorb 4 million square feet, 5 million square feet, and in some great years, we can absorb 8 million square feet and 10 million square feet.","I think the math is basically, and we\u2019ve actually done some work here with some econometric types that provided the job growth stays relatively positive, and when I say relatively positive, the job growth has been somewhere in the kind of 2.5% to 3% growth range for office sector jobs, if that number moderates to the 1.5% to 2% range, I think we\u2019re going to be just fine as it relates to the absorption of that space. Steve, do you want to add anything else to that or\u2026?","Steven Roth","Well, clearly, a lot of it has to do with the state of the economy at the time. Clearly, a lot of it has to do with the price points in question and also the geography. So, Sony building is coming back. We know what they pay for the building, we know -- by the way we know the buyer. And they are very nice rate -- obviously competent and very, very well capitalized family. So, we know what they pay for the building, we know what the downtime TI leasing commission sit up et cetera will be. So, they are obviously -- and we know the quality of the building. They are obviously going to be targeting a very, very high rental market where they will be catering to one and two floor elite kinds of companies.","So, there\u2019s that; there\u2019s a couple of -- there\u2019s a new building on Park Avenue, which is famously going after the very, very, very highest rents. There is another building kicking around in the grand central area which is also going to go with --compete for very, very high rents. So, those are in -- that\u2019s all fine. I care more about the Hudson Yards competition, which I in the mid 80s of dollars a foot. And so that competes with the general marketplace. And so, that\u2019s fine; that will be gone and then everything will be fine. So, I relish competition that comes on at a $150 a foot because that gives us a tremendous opportunity to compete at much lower prices and beat and be extremely successful. And so that\u2019s my comment.","The other thing is that each building competes in for its tenants in a different geography and each building has a different culture. So, there you have it. Obviously we will get through this, we would absorb it we will thrive. And a lot of it has to do with what the world looks like as these buildings get a little bit closer.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","Jamie Feldman","So, can you help us think about -- you just submitted your bid for Moynihan Station. You talked about 8 million square feet plots of potential development in DECLINED. I know that will take some time. You gave a lot of good color this quarter in the supplemental on the development pipeline. Can you help frame how people should think about the capital needs of both the DC platform and the New York platform in the next couple of years?","Steven Roth","Our plans are not specific enough in Penn Plaza to be able to do that, Jaime. And I don\u2019t want to go from the hip on that because it\u2019s important. Obviously we will be spending hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in Penn Plaza to accomplish our objectives there. But until we\u2019re prepared to make full disclosure of what our plans are in a very reasoned way, I\u2019m not going to speculate.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then, what about in the DC side?","Steven Roth","In the DC side, as we -- once again, as we start our projects, we will publish the budgets and the expected yields, just like we did with The Bartlett, for example.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. It\u2019s Nick Yulico here with Russ. I just want to make sure I understood the commentary about the New York City, the impact from straight line FAS 141. So, a lot of this impact I guess happened in the first quarter because you booked income last year from FAS 141, so went down in the first quarter. And when you talked about to close the $10 million straight line write off balances; that happened all in the second quarter or is that spread through the rest of the year?","Steven Roth","Yes. Nick, the 141 acceleration that was recorded in the prior year was concentrated in the second half of the year, it was the heaviest in the third and fourth quarters of last year; it is non-recurring in nature, so on a relative basis will reoccur in 2016. As it relates to the straight line write offs, there was $5.1 million in the first quarter and then there will be another $9.7 million as we go through this year. The heaviest amount of that will be in the second quarter, but it will -- the way that that accounting works is that the straight-line balances related to the early terminated leases is accelerated over the shortened remaining lease term for those tenants. And so, it\u2019s causing us to have to immediately write off the straight line balances, but there will be another $9.7 million, the heaviest slug of that will be in the second quarter of this year. Is that the information you were looking for?","Nick Yulico","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then, David, can you just talk little bit more about the leases that you had that are sort of in documentation or under negotiation today; how much of that is renewals? I think you may have had a law firm tenant you working with in 90 Park? And how much is expansionary space like you just had with the PwC lease?","David Greenbaum","Of the 1.2 million square feet that we really have in our pipeline, and as I said, of that about 0.5 million is actually in lease documentation with the balance, another 700,000 square feet in the pipeline. In the aggregate, it\u2019s probably about 50% renewal and 50% new deals. I think of the deals that we actually have in active lease documentation, which we fully expect to get closed in the second quarter, I think that\u2019s going to be probably a little bit more heavily weighted toward actual renewals where we are working on a couple of renewals, one some space that\u2019s coming up in early 2017 and then as I mentioned, the law firm who actually comes up in 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alex Goldfarb","Good morning. And first Steve, thank you for the NOI roadmap. Just as part of that, can you just talk about, one, I think you mentioned $83 million of GAAP but can you just -- how we should think about that that $83 million was this year or was that something else? And then second is while you have the $200 million of NOI that you laid out, what should we think about as far as move-outs that would offset that amount over the next -- this year and next?","Steven Roth","With respect to the timing of how the $83 million of GAAP that is yet to be recognized -- Steve, I don\u2019t have that. Steve, do you or Joe have it.","Joseph Macnow","We do. Alex it\u2019s Joe. That\u2019s approximately $53 million this year and $31 million next year.","Alex Goldfarb","So, it\u2019s 53 in \u201816; and how much?","Joseph Macnow","31 in \u201817.","Alex Goldfarb","And 31 in \u201817, okay?","Joseph Macnow","We round it, Alex. It\u2019s really 84.","Alex Goldfarb","And then, what should we be thinking about as far as lease move-out that would offset the $200 million?","Steven Roth","Well, the answer to that is none. Now, let me explain that to you. The $200 million of cash NOI that is yet to be recognized on our book is totally additive. So, there is no move-outs that will offset that. However, that only for that segment of our portfolio. So, we will have for the balance of the portfolio, normal move-outs, normal move-in and normal turnover, okay? So, if -- the presentation that I made in my opening remark is that all things being equal, in steady state, we have $200 million of additive cash NOI that will feed in -- as I mentioned, so much this year, so much \u201817, and a little bit -- and little tail in \u201818.","Alex Goldfarb","And then second is as far as the potential DC spinout, if you could just comment, it sounds like you are not willing to give timing yet, but if you could just give a comment as far as, if it were to occur, what you would see the balance sheet structure as far leverage? And then, what the cash position of that entity would be? Obviously it sounds like, there is still a lot of redevelopment going on, both in Crystal City as well as the Rosslyn side you discussed?","Steven Roth","That\u2019s a great question. First of all with respect of timing. As we -- when we make our decision we\u2019re going to do it in a -- as we did with Urban Edge. By the way, we have a history in doing this; we have done it before. So, we are sort of experienced hands at this. So, we will do it with major speed, so that\u2019s step one. Step two is that as we did with Urban Edge, it was properly capitalized; it had fine assets; it had enough money; it had enough capital and credit in its entity to complete its mission; it had a well-defined mission; it had basically inherited our management team plus the addition of one very, very talented CEO that we recruited on the outside, and then he added a CFO et cetera. So, the business will be, if as and when we make that decision and launch, it will be set up for success from a balance sheet point of view, from a capital plan point of view, from a team point of view.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","I guess, Steve, to follow up on that question, I understand the Urban Edge spinout and the rationale behind it; it was kind of a small part of the portfolio that didn\u2019t get a lot of attention, but the DC portfolio is pretty large. And I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand maybe what opportunities are not being taken full advantage of down in DC with this division being part of the Company, and trying to just understand what it may do differently, if it were standalone entity?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is -- Hi, Steve, how are you? If we do separate Washington, it will be for the reasons that we have already enunciated. And that is to have a focused management team with a very specific mission in Washington, which may or may not involve capital partners et cetera and will have its own report card, namely its own stock price, and basically have its own board and be able to make its own decisions. So, we are capitalists, we believe in incentive, we believe in report cards et cetera. So, we think that the Washington business, not that much unlike the Urban Edge business, will benefit enormously from being its own man and woman, so to speak.","We also believe that the New York business will benefit by being a focused New York business, so that global investors can invest in the New York platform, the New York assets, and our New York activities, separately from Washington or shopping centers or whatever. So that\u2019s what our objectives would be. There is nothing -- there are significant things that will be accomplished, in our mind by investors being able to choose Washington or New York as opposed to having to take both of them in the current structure.","Steve Sakwa","And then I guess to follow up on this $200 million, just to try and make sure I understand, so Steve, all of this activity is already done and taken place. And therefore, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s already out of the lease expiration schedules and therefore, as we are trying to look at the upside from leasing, this income is effectively there but not part of that schedule. Are you looking at different disclosures going forward on how we sort of monitor these figures, because they are obviously going to be sort of a constantly changing set of numbers? And it seems like there\u2019s income but it\u2019s missing and it\u2019s not part of the rollover schedule unless I\u2019m mistaken on that point.","Steven Roth","Hang on. You said this is already done. Well, so, it is done and it isn\u2019t done. The leases are signed, the income that will come from those leases is already big. But they have not yet hit our financials because either they\u2019re in free rent period or they haven\u2019t been delivered or whatever, so that they are in the bag; I call them they are in the on deck circle. All that income is absolutely legally bound, but it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s a matter of timing and delivery and free rent burn off et cetera. And it\u2019s huge -- one of the reasons, I mean what we -- it\u2019s huge when you think about it. So, it comes on top of $900 million base. And so, that\u2019s that. In terms of disclosure, I don\u2019t know -- I really don\u2019t know. We will have to sit down and figure out what more if anything that we have just said today and in what format we will increase our disclosure. We think our disclosure is not bad, but. So, really, I can\u2019t answer that question right now. I\u2019m stuttering; I can\u2019t answer right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lewis with SunTrust.","Michael Lewis","So, I appreciate the enhanced development disclosure in the supplemental. I just have a question about how it\u2019s working, right? So, if I use, on page 30, if I look at 512 West 52nd for example. I believe that\u2019s a $235 million development. And so, I see the CIP is $8 million, the incremental budget is $72 million. How do I get those numbers to add up and should I assume that this is all your share on this page as well?","Steven Roth","Alright, I now have that schedule in front of me what. What\u2019s\u2026","Michael Lewis","I\u2019m using 512 West 52nd as an example but -- because I think that project last quarter or two quarters ago, you said that was a $235 million project, and right here, you are showing $8 million of CIP, $72 million of incremental budget. I\u2019m just wondering how all the costs are accounted for here.","Steven Roth","What we\u2019re trying to show is -- and the numbers as far as the budget and the amounts that are -- construction progress and line costs, those are at our shares, so, these are all our share numbers.","Michael Lewis","So, so that gets me closer.","Michael Franco","The 235 is a 100% for the development and that\u2019s a full cost at a 100%. The numbers here to the -- show here our share.","Steven Roth","Our share, that\u2019s correct.","Michael Lewis","So, that gets me closer to the number","Steven Roth","And this excludes land.","Michael Lewis","My second question is about -- you guys noted how you got your proposal in for Penn Station and the post office. I think all the proposals were due last week, if I\u2019m correct. And so, I\u2019m wondering if you know what the timetable is for developer to be chosen? And then, if it\u2019s you, what are the next steps and kind of how quickly do you move on something?","Steven Roth","We really can\u2019t answer that question. We are in the government\u2019s hands. And so we had submitted our proposals on the due date. And we do not know the process that the reviewers and selectors will adopt and what their time table is. So, we just don\u2019t know. And I really -- until I know more, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to speculate.","Michael Lewis","Fair enough, sounds about right for the government. Thanks.","Steven Roth","No, no, I didn\u2019t say that, you did. I\u2019m in full suck up mode.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan","In terms of 220 Central Park South, can you discuss your expectations for the amount of time it might take to sell the remaining condos and at what kind of price point relative to units that have already been sold?","Steven Roth","Our enthusiasm for 220 Central Park South and the quality of the project, the market reception of the product is not diminished at all. There was a low in the market over the end of last year and the first of couple of months of this year, I guess in response to general fatigue, too many other projects coming on board, extreme worldwide global financial volatility, and I think the most interesting of which is we are not delivering for 2.5 years. So, the project is off to a roaring start, the marketplace accepts it as being the class A plus project. And so that\u2019s the status. Now, in the recent weeks, we have had a significant uptick in traffic through our sales room, as I said in my prepared remarks. And we are now negotiating two very important deals. The pricing of the project will -- we have no expectation that the pricing of the project will diminish more than -- by the way it could go up from the in place contracts that have already been signed. In terms of timing, since we basically have our course of the project and we have 2.5 years to go to delivery, we are optimistic that we will have either the entire project or almost the entire project totally sold before we deliver.","Jed Reagan","Okay. Thanks for that. And just to be clear, the budget for that project is still in line with last quarter?","Steven Roth","Yes.","Jed Reagan","And in terms of the valuation environment, are you seeing signs of cap rates changing for lower quality or value-add assets, either on the office or retail side of things, and are you seeing the mix or depth of bidding times changing?","Steven Roth","I\u2019ll let Michael Franco -- our CIO will answer that. And then I\u2019ll pipe in.","Michael Franco","In general, I\u2019d say the first quarter was less active than last year, but for our segments, office, retail, I think activity is down. I don\u2019t think pricing has changed. I think Steve highlighted two premium quality assets. And I think as we said in the last call, our expectation was the capital environment for high quality assets was going to remain very favorable and it does. Capital continues to be very interesting in New York and the pricing for assets like that reflects that. So the value added assets, there have not been many examples yet, although I think the Watchtower trade is an example, it\u2019s not close yet but it\u2019s under contract. And I think that pricing was very full, not really reflecting a capital markets impact. So, I think pricing for office, retail generally continues to be strong, even when there is value add components.","Steven Roth","So, Jed, from my point of view, I see a reduction in the pace of activity at all price points, which is not unusual. These things fluctuate. I see if anything, a scarcity of highest quality product, a scarcity of highest quality product. I know that incomings that we get from global investors interested in partnering, buying et cetera at the highest quality is increasing rather than decreasing. And the incomings are now coming from very, very far and wide geographies including Asia, the Middle East, Europe et cetera, and domestically by the way and Canada obviously.","So, I think in terms of the highest quality, if anything, the demand looks like it\u2019s increasing. In terms of lower quality, we don\u2019t focus as, so I\u2019m not that concerned about it. But I can tell you that a lot of that is get driven stuff with the entrepreneurial sponsors and buyers and sellers. And the debt markets that drive, kinds of speculation is getting very skinish. So, the availability of wild and wooly debt to finance that kinds of stuff is with withdrawing a little bit or maybe even a lot. So, that obviously affected that activity level. So, where I am is in New York and New York is in a class of its own by the way. In New York at the highest quality, if anything, I see it increasing demand and no diminishing in pricing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. ","John Guinee","One of the things that we like about Empire is we can back in and we figure that Empire State Realty Trust we think is valued at about $660 a square foot for the Manhattan office; we think SL Green is valued at about $760 a square foot for the Manhattan office. Do you have any sense for when you look at Vornado at the current share price, what you would ascribe to a per square foot value of say the DC office or the High Street retail or the Manhattan office?","Steven Roth","Do we have any idea? Sure. I can tell you that it\u2019s substantially higher than the numbers that you just mentioned. But we are not in the business speculating or that\u2019s -- I have my concepts of values and you do yours.","John Guinee","But you don\u2019t look at 100 bucks a share and come up with, boy, it looks like people are valuing our Manhattan office at $500 versus $1,000 a foot right now?","Steven Roth","Sure, John. I had a fairly long page in my annual shareholders letter this year which was titled I think public real estate is cheap. I think that was the title of that section, if remember. And it was basically a discussion about NAV versus share prices for our Company and the other New York folks, our colleagues in New York. So, what we do is we basically are an NAV focused management. We believe that NAV is the roadmap of value and that is the most accurate predictor of what the value of the companies are. NAV is based upon the private market values and a cap rate. And so, we do our work and you do yours, and all of the folks on the phone do theirs. So, we think that the NAV is the roadmap. And we have been very clear in saying; and by the way a lot of our colleagues in New York have been equally as clear in saying that we think that the NAVs are substantially above the stock prices.","Now, the punch line to my opening remarks today about the $200 million of cash NOI that is in the bag from signed leases that will flow into our financials over the next short period of time is that that creates $20 or $25 a share of NAV. Now, Empire is a friend of mine, but Vornado is Vornado. and so $25 a share is $5 billion of incremental increased value. Now, a lot of the analysts who do this kind of math have some forward number, which is more than the number of $900 million that I mentioned today, but clearly the vast majority of that $20 to $25 a share is not yet in anybody\u2019s numbers. So, the long and the short of it is, is that we are NAV oriented; we do our NAVs, you do yours. And, we think the lessons are that the stocks sell for much less than the NAVs; in our case, very substantially less.","Now, as I\u2019ve said before and I think I said this in the letter, I\u2019m a lifelong public company executive. So, I worship to the God of the stock market. And the stock market says -- the stock market is a weighing machine. And that\u2019s my answer.","John Guinee","And just a question for David. David, if you\u2019re looking at Hotel Pennsylvania as a parking lot and if you were able to build today, do you have any sense, excluding land what it would cost you to do a couple of million square foot office building; is it $600 a foot or $1,000 a foot above the land cost?","David Greenbaum","I think taking out land cost, and assuming you are talking about an office development, and obviously, you could do residential, you could do resi and a hotel, but on an office basis, I think all in including hard costs, soft costs, TIs, leasing commissions, construction costs that number is north of $1,000 a foot for a major $2.5 million square foot tower to develop today in New York.","John Guinee","Say it again.","David Greenbaum","The number I said Steve was well north of $1,000 a foot, probably could be $1,200 or even $1,300 or $1400 a foot, as you\u2019re looking at developing a 2.5 million plus square foot tower.","John Guinee","I agree.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs.","Brad Burke","Just a two-part question on the New York same store. Last quarter, you indicated that you expect well over 5% same store growth in New York but it\u2019d be back end loaded. So, first, is that a cash or a GAAP number? And second, does that still seem like a reasonable goal for same store for the full year?","Stephen Theriot","I think the cash number reflective of again what Steve talked about, as you cycle in, both GAAP and cash, the cash number is going to be significantly higher than the GAAP number. The cash number I think what I said was we would expect by the end of this year to be approaching double digit growth and that we would be looking at similar growth into 2017. I think the GAAP number that we had this quarter of about 6% is what we\u2019re going to be looking at the balance of this year and into next year.","Joseph Macnow","Brad, it\u2019s Joe Macnow. Let me pick up on David\u2019s 6% GAAP, to make sure that there is a little less chance of confusion. So, if David\u2019s business is doing $250 million a quarter and you expected a 6% GAAP same store, you would expect the comparable quarter in \u201816 to be $15 million higher than a $250 million quarter in 2015. David stands by that. That is what is. What Steve Theriot told you was that 2016\u2019s third quarter -- or second quarter, let\u2019s take the one coming up, will have a negative comparison of $11.3 million from that $15 million, caused by non-cash income in 2015\u2019s quarters and expense in 2016\u2019s quarters. So, I know that earlier Nick asked that question, Steve Theriot answered it. I thought about giving an example then, but this is a better time. So, is that clear to Brad and everybody else?","Brad Burke","I can\u2019t speak for everyone else. It\u2019s clear to me.","Michael Franco","You can speak for everyone else. Goldman Sachs is Goldman Sachs.","Brad Burke","All right, everyone is on the same page.","Steven Roth","I can only tell you, I prefer cash numbers. They are much simpler. Next?","Operator","We are done.","Steven Roth","Okay. So, I think unless anybody else cares to ask a question, I think the queue is empty now; is that correct?","Operator","That is correct.","Steven Roth","So, we thank you very much; we appreciate your -- this was a little bit less of a marathon than last quarter. We appreciate your joining our call. We appreciate your interest in our Company. We will see everybody at [indiscernible] I guess in June in New York. And thank you all very much.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect."],"22089":["Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) Q3 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call October 31, 2017 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Cathy Creswell - Director, IR","Steven Roth - Chairman & CEO","David Greenbaum - President, New York Division","Joseph Macnow - EVP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer","Michael Franco - EVP & CIO","Analysts","Michael Belman - Citi","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","John Guinee - Stifel","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Steve Sakwa - Evercore","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors","Nick Yulico - UBS","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Vornado Realty Trust Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. My name is Adrienne and I\u2019ll be your operator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions]","I'll now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Cathy Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s third quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our third quarter earnings release and filed our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","These documents as well as our supplemental financial information package are available on our website, www.vno.com under the Investor Relations section.

Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, Form 10-Q and financial supplement.","Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

Also in the room is Michael Franco, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's third quarter 2017 call.","I will start with our third quarter financial results which were truly outstanding and industry leading. Please note that this is the first quarter that we are reporting to the New York-centric Vornado RemainCo without Washington.","GAAP FFO as adjusted for comparability for the quarter was $0.99 per share compared to $0.93 per share last year, a very strong 6.5% increase. Cash FFO as adjusted for the quarter was $0.87 per share compared to $0.70 per share last year, a truly outstanding 24.3% increase. Our same-store metrics are also outstanding and industry leading.","Our York New segment EBITDA was positive 5% GAAP, and positive 13.8% cash. theMART in Chicago was positive 11.3% GAAP and positive 17.0% cash. 555 California was positive 1.7% GAAP and positive 13.2% cash.","This quarter's outperformance validates our strategy of deconglomerating and focusing on RemainCo's New York centric business. And if past performance matters, I think it does. Vornado RemainCo has been the leader among all of the blue chip peer in same-store NOI growth since 2006. Please see Page 13 of our September 2017 deck on our website. This is one of my favorite charts.","David will dive in shortly, here are some of the highlights. New York office leased 452,000 square feet, 405,000 square feet a share with record-breaking average rent starting at $83 per foot and that's outstanding. Mark-to-markets were 11.9% GAAP and 11.2% cash. We are full at 97% occupancy up 30 basis points from last year.","Demand for office space in New York is robust coming from all manner of users. We invest in our buildings, they are developed and modernized, well-positioned to attract tenants across all market sectors.","A few years ago I coined the phrase the island of Manhattan is tilting to the West and to the South. Today the hottest submarkets in town run from Hudson Yards to Penn Plaza and extend South through Chelsea and [indiscernible]. Anticipating these trends we have structured our office portfolio so that half of our square footage is on this district.","In our New York street retail business, we leased 38,000 square feet including a 16,000 square foot leased at Safora at our 1535 Broadway in Times Square. This store will be Safora's largest in the U.S. and will replace their existing store across the street which we understand is their highest grossing in the U.S.","As David will get into in a moment, we are in final drafts of a 12,000 square foot lease with a major national retailer also at 1535 Broadway. With these two deals we will be 100% leased at our two Times Square properties which are the two best platforms on both sides of the [indiscernible].","New York retail occupancy was 95.7% up 40 basis points from last quarter. Retail mark-to-market for the quarter were negative 20.5% GAAP and positive 2.5% cash. The negative GAAP mark is the victim of a single midblock 20,800 square foot a share, short-term renewal at 1290 Avenue of the Americas. The rent on the expiring lease was marked up as a SaaS 141 adjustment when we acquired the building in 2007.","Excluding the SaaS 141 adjustment, the GAAP basis increase would have been positive 8.0%. We chose to extend this bank branch tenant for three years with us having an early termination right at the same rent depending on redevelopment of the states.","Notwithstanding our recent success in Times Square which by the way demonstrate that the best real estate wins the race, as I have said before the general retail market even on the streets of New York continues to be quite soft. In my annual letter to shareholders last year on Pages 15 through 17, I laid out my views on retail and general and on our retail business in particular including 2017 cash guidance.","I reaffirm that guidance today. In fact, our budget show that 2017 may even come in a couple of percent higher. I will repeat what I said on last year's call, our Upper Fifth Avenue on Time Square retail assets where the majority of our retail value is are buttoned up for term, with great tenants and great [guidance]. These are great assets, they are unique, extremely scarce, irreplaceable as on the highest quality of the world. Here is an interesting fact.","In all of our Upper Fifth Avenue and Time Square properties, we have only one lease expiry in the next five years, that being the Massimo Dutti store, a Zara division at our 689 Fifth Avenue, which expires in mid-2019 at a below-market REIT.","Now turning to the investment of financing markets. Investment sales activity is down appreciably from last year, largely a function of buyer caution, lesser quality product being brought to market and owners electing to refinance rather than sell.","Demand and pricing from office assets located South and West in Manhattan is very strong as evidenced by the recent Twitter, Red Bull and St. John's building sales. We also believe that if a true trophy asset were brought to market, pricing would be as strong as ever. Moreover, while it has been the much discussed slowdown in Chinese capital flows recently, that continues to be robust interest in New York assets from all manner of capital sources both domestic and foreign.","Retail investment sales are suffering from buyer skittishness. Debt markets for New York assets are on fire and remain as liquid and strong as we have ever seen with all markets CMBS, Bank, life companies that even the [indiscernible] and BPs markets worldwide open at very competitive pricing. And as I just said, given this relative strength of the debt markets many owners are opting to refinance rather than to sell.","We will continue to prune and focus the business. We have identified another $1 billion of assets that we will be selling over the next several years and that does not include the expected proceeds from 220 Central Park South.","Let me conclude by saying as many of you know I had bypass surgery in mid-August. I am now better than new and have been back to work for a while now. I want to thank everyone for your good wishes, very much appreciated. Thank you.","Now over to David.","David Greenbaum","Steve thank you, and good morning everyone.","As in our last few calls, I'll start by offering some thoughts on the market and then dive deeper into our third quarter activity. Let me first start with the critical employment measure we track. Office using employment which had 14,000 new jobs through the third quarter is well within the range we like to see of 10,000 and 15,000 annually that we estimated as needed to absorb the new supply coming online over the next five years.","The story for this year continues to be one of strong growth in professional and business services, as well as resurgence in financial services employment which in the third quarter finally reached its pre-financial crisis level. Some of these jobs were offset by a very modest decline in [TAMI] jobs. That is not to say however that tech employment in this city is dropping. All signs point to continued growth in technology positions within non-tech companies.","As I discussed last quarter, when it comes to pursuing talent both new and old industries are converging on the same group of people driving century-old companies such as Aetna, Allstate and ConAgra to creative class buildings that can better attract talented young professionals. A recent report by the state comptroller estimates that out of 240,000 technology jobs in New York City, over 46% 112,000 jobs are tech jobs in traditional companies from retail to healthcare to insurance and to banking. And there is reason to anticipate continued strong growth in the years ahead including with the recent opening of the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Islands. That\u2019s just one of an array of cities date and university efforts that are underway.","On the market leasing front, performance has been robust through the third quarter. You can see this in the town of all of the brokerage reports. JLL's most recent report is entitled \u201cstrength on Manhattan's West Side drives leasing higher and vacancy lower\u201d. And Cushman Wakefield they state \u201cThe market office performed well in the third quarter of 2017 highlighted by an uptick in leasing and positive absorption\u201d","Total leasing in Manhattan reached 9.4 million square feet in the third quarter with year-to-date total leasing now at 30.6 million square feet continuing on track to approach the record leasing year of 2014 when citywide 42 million square feet of leases were completed.","Overall vacancy improved 20 basis points to 9%, average asking rents in Manhattan approached $73 per square foot, absorption was a positive 2.3 million square feet and sublease space declined by 6.2%. With major new lease commitments by Blackrock, Amazon and Accenture in Hudson Yards and Manhattan West. We believe our asset in Penn Plaza with its unrivaled transit access both our existing buildings and our development opportunities continue to become more and more valuable.","Let me turn now to our portfolio where we had a very strong third quarter. We remain full with our office occupancy up 30 basis points to 97%. We leased over 450,000 square feet of office space in the quarter in 33 transactions. With average starting rents of $83 a foot, the quarter reflects both the quality of our assets and the breadth of our multitenant portfolio.","100,000 square feet of our leasing activity or 22% or that triple digit numbers, and at One Penn Plaza we achieved $70 average starting rents, a new record. While RTI's and leasing commissions were on the high side that is in large part a reflection of the average lease term which approached 10 years.","Our mark-to-markets remain strong 11.9% GAAP and 11.2% cash. These mark-to-markets are a result of the success of the redevelopment efforts. Over the past five years since the start of 2013 mark-to-market and our office portfolio have averaged 18% GAAP and 13% cash.","And same-store numbers in the office portfolio also remain industry-leading during the third quarter at 7.1% GAAP and 13.5% cash. As with our mark-to-market our same-store performance has remained at an industry-leading level over an extended period of time. Since 2013 again for five years we have averaged same-store growth of 4.6% GAAP and 7.7% cash.","In Penn Plaza work is now well underway to transform the Farley building into the dramatic Moynihan train hall with 730,000 square feet of best-in-class creative office space on unique floor plates and 120,000 square feet of ancillary retail space.","In mid-August, Governor Cuomo celebrated the start of major construction in the cavernous space that will become the train hall where our construction partner Skanska has been busy cutting openings down to Penn station platforms for the new escalators and elevators. From the street you can see the two cranes building the soaring skylights that enclose the newly 100 foot high main train hall. We have begun to introduce the office space for tenants and brokers and the early response has been a wow, as you'd expect for an asset as unique as this one.","Imaginary actions we get when we take people up onto the roof and show them the potential for a 50,000 square foot outdoor roof deck amenity space in the heart of Manhattan. It's truly spectacular.","As you would expect, the Farley building was front and center in our submission to the city for inclusion in the city's proposal to host Amazon's HQ2 headquarters. We pointed out Farley could accommodate Amazon's near-term needs with significant room to grow in the existing buildings and development sites we own in the Penn Plaza district. We were pleased to see in the public materials that the city released Midtown West anchored by Penn Plaza was front and center in the proposals to Amazon.","The city noted that the area is accessible by 15 subway lines, four commuter rail lines and Amtrak with direct connective in place or plan to all three regional airports. With Amazon already having committed to 800,000 square feet in two sites that bookend our Penn Plaza holdings, 450,000 square feet at our own 7 West 34th Street and an additional 360,000 square feet in Manhattan West across the street from Farley but the New York win HQ2 raise or not, Amazon will have a long-term significant presence in the district for years to come.","With the end of the year approaching, we have a negligible amount of 2017 office lease expirations remaining. At 97% occupancy, we are full. Our single largest block of space currently available is 70,000 square feet in One Penn Plaza. ","We see a relatively quiet fourth quarter and Glen and his team continues to address our lease expirations of 950,000 square feet in 2018 and 775,000 square feet in 2019. Over a third of our lease expirations over the next two years are concentrated in One Penn Plaza, where we are now finalizing our plan for the total redevelopment and modernization of this asset including a new lobby, store fronts, plages, amenity spaces and state-of-the-art infrastructure. ","We have a proven formula for repositioning our assets, just look at our track record at 90 Park Avenue, 280 Park Avenue, 1296 Avenue, 330 West 34th street and the Mart, to just name a few. We expect to commence this redevelopment of One Penn Plaza next summer. ","Turning to our irreplaceable High Street retail business, as Steve mentioned, the highlight of our activity has been the completion of a 16,000 square foot flagship lease with Safora at 1535 Broadway at the heart of the heart of the bowtie in Times Square. We also are in final drafts for another flagship lease the major national retailer for the remaining 12,000 square feet at 1535. ","The balance of our retail leasing activity for the third quarter related to the renewal of two leases and the base of our office buildings not what we would call \"High Street Retail\" at cash mark-to-market of a positive 2.5%, but as Steve mentioned with a negative 20.5% GAAP mark-to-market, solely attributable to a FAS 141 purchase price adjustment, that was made back in 2007. ","A same store numbers for our Street retail business for the quarter were strong positive 13.8% cash and a flattish negative 0.6% GAAP. ","Let me now turn to theMART in Chicago, where our leasing continues to benefit from our development efforts over the last several years. During the third quarter we entered into a 36,000 square feet of office and showroom leases, at average starting rents exceeding $54 a foot. These leases represented mark-to-market of 36.4% GAAP and 23.1% cash. ","Occupancy stands at 98% for the showroom and retail space and over 99% for office, demonstrating the extraordinary depth for space by existing tenants seeking to expand and new tenants looking to join our blue-chip roster. As a result, we are in the process of taking back an additional 40,000 square of showroom space from the apparel tenants on the ninth floor in order to create more best-in-class office space. Our same-store numbers at theMART for the third quarter were positive, 11.3% GAAP and 17% cash. ","Similar to our industry leading numbers for our New York performance, looking back over the last five years since 2013, our average mark-to-market at theMART have been 22.7% gap and 14.8% cash. That\u2019s an average for the last five years. Our average same-store growth at theMART over the past five years has been even more extraordinary at 8.9% on a GAAP basis and 8.8% cash. Let me repeat that one more time. At theMART, our same store increases both on a GAAP and a cash basis have averaged around 9% per annum through each of the last five years. ","While it was a quiet quarter at 555 California Street, we were active at the adjacent 315 Montgomery Street building. Last quarter, I told you that we had two leases out for five floors representing 60,000 square feet. We completed those deals during the third quarter at $72 starting rents. 315 Montgomery, a historical building with good bonds and a great location just a few years back was a class D building with rents only $35 to $40 per square foot. ","Having completed our modernization of the 315 building earlier this year, we\u2019ve now leased the total of 7 floors this year. We have just 3 floors left to complete and leased up of this asset. And we\u2019re in term sheets for negotiation for all of this space. ","Let me just conclude by saying, our strong leasing performance in the third quarter is a reflection of both the continued health of our markets as well as a portfolio that is largely renovated and concentrated in the growth area of this city. ","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph Macnow","Thank you David, good morning everyone. I remind you that on July 17 of this year, we completed the spinoff of our Washington business, and accordingly our third quarter comparable results of Vornado RemainCo without Washington. ","Washington results have been reclassified to discontinued operations and now included in non-comparable items for all periods presented, along with the $53.6 million of transaction cost in the quarter. Another non-comparable item in the third quarter was a $44.5 million non-cash impairment on our shares in Pennsylvania REIT. We received Pennsylvania REIT\u2019s operating partnership newness as part of the proceeds, when we sold them to Springfield Mall in March 2015. ","I reemphasize what Steve and David say. FFO as adjusted for comparability of 6.5%, is very strong. Cash FFO as adjusted for comparability of 24.3%, the industry leading same-store EBITDA and NOI metrics, the positive leasing mark-to-market, and the occupancy in the high 90% up percent, all trends led into a truly outstanding results for this quarter for Vornado RemainCo.","And our continues effort to improve our reporting to shareholders, this quarter is supplement includes additional information, regarding our disclosure of trailing 12months pro forma cash NOI on page 9. Specifically, we\u2019re providing a summary by quarter of $183.7 million of incremental revenue from signed leases commences, as well as a $37.8 GAAP equivalent. We also have disclosed a $89.2 million of capital remaining to be spend related to this incremental revenue. ","Now, I\u2019m turning to financing activities. On July 19, our 25% owned joint venture that owns 330 Madison Avenue and 845,000 square foot Manhattan office building completed a $500 million refinancing. The seven year interest-only loan matures in August 2024, and has a fixed rate of 3.425%. The property was previously encumbered by a $150 million mortgage at LIBOR plus 1.30%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $85 million, after repayment of the existing loan and closing cost. ","On August 23, our 50% owned joint ventures, that owns 280 Park Avenue, a 1.25 million square foot Manhattan office building completed a $1.2 billion refinancing. This interest-only loans matures in September 2024 as extended, and has interest of LIBOR plus 1.73%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $140 million, after closing course and repayment of the existing loans, with were interest at LIBOR plus 2%.","On October 17, we extended one of our two $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities, from November 2019 to January 2022 with 2 six month extension option. This resulted us over subscribe and very well executed. The interest rate on the extended facility was lower from LIBOR plus 1.05%, to LIBOR plus 1%. The facility fee remains unchanged at 20 basis points. The interest rate and facility's fees are as the same as our other $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, which matures in February 2021, with two six months extension option.","Vornado RemainCo has no remaining 2017 consolidated or partially owned entity debt maturities. 2018 consolidated debt maturities are $120 million, and our share of partially owned entities 2017 maturities is $444.6 million. The largest of which is $275.6 million at our share for Independence Plaza, a three tower, 327-unit residential rental complex in Tribeca in which we owned 50.1% interest. ","Excluding the financing on our 220 Central Park South Project which will self-liquidate as signed contracts close, our consolidated debt metrics are fixed rate debt account 78% of debt with a weighted average rate of 3.65% and a weighted average term of 4.2 years, and floating rate debt accounted to 22% of debt with the weighted average interest rate of 3.06% and a weighted average term of 3.6 years. ","Debt to enterprise value is 27.1% based on last night's closing stock price. Consolidated debt net of cash to EBITDA is 5.9 times, including our share of partially owned entities debt other than 666 Fifth Avenue Office and Toys \"R\" Us debt net of cash to EBITDA is 7 times. ","In closing, Vornado has a fortress balance sheet with modest leverage and well staggered debt maturities. Post to JBJS spin-off we have $4.1 billion in liquidity comprised of $1.6 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and our undrawn $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities.","I will now turn the call back to Steve. ","Steven Roth","Thank you. We happy to take your questions. ","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Manny from Citi. Please go ahead. ","Michael Belman ","It's Michael Belman here with Manny from Citi. Steve, in your opening comments you've talked about I think you said $1 billion of proceeds from potential sales over the next several years. And I just wanted to get a little bit more clarity in terms of gross versus net to the company. And what are the some of the big pieces that we comprise that $1 billion of proceeds?","Steven Roth","I think your question is what's in the $1 billion? Is that your question Michael?","Michael Belman ","That is the $1 billion question. ","Steven Roth","So we've got some stocks which are going to be for sale. I mean they are Lexington, 10 REIT, Urban Edge et cetera. So we've got a it could be the better part of the $0.5 billion of common stocks. We have several assets which were not contributed to the JBG Smith spinoff which are in the Washington market and basically are not in our core. So those amount to whatever. We have some debt positions that are coming do, we have some shopping center that we still retained that will be sold et cetera. ","So when you added all up, it comes to significantly more than be, quite a lot significantly more than $1 billion, number one. Number two, the sales will come over some of them have some tax protections, some of them have some other reasons locked out because of spinoff regulations et cetera. But over the next several years, we will realized over $1 billion from that. And what's more, that doesn't include the expected proceeds from the completion of 220 Central Park South which will be as well a very significant number. ","Michael Belman ","And then just secondly, David talked about starting 110 the redevelopment, a lot of the things you're going to do. Can you talk a little bit more about sort of the total budget for that plan and whether there's anything you're waiting for from city to state to go forward and do that next summer or is there other parts of the 10 Plaza redevelopment that you would want to open before you get some of that funding from different government agencies?","Joseph Macnow","The One Penn redevelopment does require some actions by city planning. We expect to have those actions in place in the second half of next year although we do expect in fact to commence the redevelopment program even in advance of those final approvals. Steve, you wanted to comment about the budgets at this point on.","Steven Roth","Well let me just tack on to what David said. The city planning approvals that we did our serial they really involve - it\u2019s the conversion of Plaza space into - so we\u2019re jiggering that around a little bit to the benefit of we think the public in the building.","If we for some untoward reason which won't happen but if it did happen that we don't get that approval, we still have a major redevelopment and improvement of that asset that will proceed okay. So we look at as basically unconditional.","Now with respect to the budget we have not published it yet and we will likely publish it may be in the \u2013 when we report fourth quarter.","Michael Belman ","And Steve it\u2019s great that you're back better than ever.","Steven Roth","Thank you very much Michael. By the way with respect to One Penn, One Penn is a massive assets its 2.6 million square feet of rentable space it dominates the district we are now achieving $70 starting rents. So the asset is its an important asset, it sits right on top of the train station and we had very, very, very high aspirations for the future growth of this asset.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","I know you gave some steps on leasing spreads first thing for retail but I guess as you think through the leases you signed and the potential lease you have in the works at Times Square. Can you talk through kind of what the same-store outlook looks like over the next few years given that it sounds like things are pretty much buttoned up?","Steven Roth","You're talking about retail office or both?","Jamie Feldman","Street retail.","Steven Roth","Street retail is soft we said that this is the second year now one might say it's a challenging environment for street retail. We believe, if we can hold street retail level until the cycle ends that would be doing very well. And we think we will - so we go into this period with the following weapons.","Okay, number one, we have an extremely low basis in this great green street retail portfolio. So we have flexibility to be competitive that other competitors don't. Number two, we have very, very low debt on this portfolio. If you take our flagship assets which are our Fifth Avenue assets and our Times Square assets you put them together, we don't have $1 billion of debt we have somewhere at 800, some odd billion dollars of debt on that which is against the portfolio that is five or six times more valuable than that.","So maybe we have below 20% debt on these assets. So those two things low basis low debt puts us in a very competitive position. Next, these assets are the very best assets in the marketplace and these are the assets that retailers need to have. So that also makes us very competitive.","Next we have long-term leases on all of the Fifth Avenue and Times Square assets. We are leased up for term, I mean we have one extra in the next five years as I think we said and this is all with very, very great retailers and very good credits.","Almost all of those leases have upticks in them and I think we published recently that we had if you look at our portfolio there are $8 million is that GAAP or NOI.","Joseph Macnow","NOI","Steven Roth","We have $8 million of cash books in our retail portfolio which will protect the portability to some degree. Now there are going to be lease rolled out, they will be insubstantial and in relation to the multi-hundred million dollars I mean over $300 million of income coming in they will be insubstantial. We will compete, we will keep our portfolio for we think we are in a very, very strong position.","Jamie Feldman","And then I guess as you're thinking about the future, where would say rents are versus the peak in the key sub markets?","Steven Roth","I mean that's a very difficult - this is a very thin market Jamie where there are very few tenants trolling there are very few deals that are being made okay, I can tell you that the two leases that we talk about here in Times Square. The Safora lease and the unnamed lease which we expect to be signed very, very shortly they are within spitting distance of the top tick okay and they are fair rents which the retailers can make a lot of money and so what I'm saying is - they\u2019re within spitting distance of the top tick.","We believe that while that may not be atypical in other words if you have to look for the clearing price when there are no tenants out there that could be very bloody that does not have any characterization of our portfolio.","Jamie Feldman","And then just last, any thoughts on we work Lord & Taylor deal and what it means for either your 34th Street assets or retail or office in the city?","Steven Roth","I wrote about we work in my last year's letter, we know these folks we know them well. We think what they're doing is unbelievably impressive. I won\u2019t comment on valuations, but I think that - we welcome them as a neighborhood, we\u2019re happy to have them and we think they\u2019ll improve, I think that obviously this was a financially driven transaction that recapitalizes Lord & Taylor and so I think that\u2019s good.","The fact that Lord & Taylor will be closing or either shrinking down to 25% of their previous store or maybe even closing it entirely is of no moment whatsoever to us.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","Steve, assets are better than new and the CEO is better than new congratulations, question?","Steven Roth","Is that a well wish, thank you.","John Guinee","That is a well wish. Joe looks to me like your run rate on your G&A is about $140 million, DSPs around 111 million SO grain is about 100 million and that includes a fairly vibrant DCE business would probably cost him about 20 million a year. What you think about your G&A in 2018 given that NAV discounts matter less and cash flow matters more?","Joseph Macnow","We have to reconcentrate our assets on reducing G&A. I will tell you that we plan to publish in the supplemental analysis of G&A which gives you a better shot of understanding. We still supply services to Urban Edge that shows us fee income and G&A. We supply a lot of services to JBG Smith that shows us fee income and G&A. We service Alexander's that fee income and G&A. So we want to do a better job of portraying you to real, real net rate of G&A but that is high and we have to work on it we\u2019re committed to work on it.","John Guinee","And then the second question, tax issues on your LXT stock your Urban Edge stock your Penn REIT stock are you able to sell these without incurring a tax hit or are these all going to be taxable transactions?","Steven Roth","LXT is - we have basis that is about 80% of the market price. So there will be small, I think 20% of the sales proceeds will be taxable, so that step one. On Urban Edge, what's our basis in Urban Edge?","Joseph Macnow","No tax. ","Steven Roth","What?","Joseph Macnow","No tax on Urban tax. I'm sorry, there is.","Steven Roth","So just looking at Urban Edge. It looks like Urban Edge we have basis for 50% of the market value and 50% will be taxable. And the last one Penn REIT, Penn REIT I think is tax protected for of unknown, what?","Joseph Macnow","No tax. ","Steven Roth","It is tax protected, we can\u2019t sell it. We have a lockout on sale until a individual passage. What\u2019s the tax basis on Penn REIT?","Joseph Macnow","We won\u2019t have taxable income allocated to us from the sale of Penn REIT. So when Steve gave you the $1billion number before, that was cash retained by Vornado. There are some taxable gains, most of which you just heard Steve talk about that the absence of other capital loss carryovers would be distributions to shareholders. But the $1 billion you talked about was cash we retained. ","Unidentified Analyst","All right. Thank you. ","David Greenbaum","John, let me say slightly in other way and Joe is absolutely correct. These assets are slightly different than most of our buildings in our portfolio. And that is that we are able to sell most of these assets, maybe even all of these assets and retain almost all of the proceeds. ","Operator","And the next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Vikram Malhotra ","Congrats Steve as well for brief coming back well and healthy. Just a follow-up on the Street retail business. In your opinion, and you have laid out well kind of the bigger broader challenges with retail and how the Vornado portfolio is different. In your view, where are we in the correction? Said in other way, we seen rents come down at least asking rents as reported by the Real Estate Board of New York. Where are we in that correction? What are you monitoring? And is there any signs in certain submarkets that things are turning?","Steven Roth","Yes, there were bottom Fishers that are coming into the market, I am sorry about tenants. There is a pickup in activity. I am not willing to call a bottom. ","Vikram Malhotra","And then just as a follow up. Some of your comments on the redevelopment of Penn Plaza. Can you give us some color on and maybe that\u2019s that includes Farley as well. Can you give us some color on the types of conversation you are having with perspective tenants? Let\u2019s say, the Amazon headquarter deal does not come through. Are you having conversations or, this make sure discussions with large which users that may needs the large amount of space? And is there demand for that type of space in the Penn Plaza area?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is there is demand, we are in conversations. But they're not in a position to talk about any speculate on any event.","Operator","And your next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Steve Sakwa","I guess David, just on the office side. Can you just maybe talk about the discussions you are having with tenants kind of on the 2018, 2019? And kind of where is the sort of sense of urgency to kind of due deals, or tenants coming in early trying to get renewals done? And just sort of what is that dynamic look like today?","David Greenbaum","Listen our portfolio is a real multitenant portfolio. What I said earlier is the single largest piece of vacant space we have, the 70,000 square feet in the entire portfolio. So as you look at the expirations that we have coming up over the next couple of years, much of it is tenants that have 5,000 feet, 10,000 feet, 30,000 feet. And these are regular discussions that we have with tenants all the time. We are in active dialogue right now with tenants in the portfolio as well as some new tenants of somewhere in the 440,000, 450,000 square feet. And we have proposal of out going back in forth. In addition to that of the better part of 800,000 to 900,000 square feet.","Realistically, what I\u2019ll call them normal locking and tackling. The question that Vikram had asked about, some of the big fish hunting that realistically relates today to what we have in the Farley building. And as I\u2019ve said on this call and on the prior call, as you begin to witness and understand the grander of this extraordinarily full blocked building. The truly unique nature of these footprints, where we can deliver 250,000 feet of floor. It is extraordinarily attractive to the creative types of tenants. ","I\u2019ll give you just kind of one data point. And that is in early August, the entire senior team here, went to the West Coast. And we\u2019ve spent the better part of 2-3 days, visiting some of our tenants and customers, as well as other companies, just to understand the nature what these campuses are in Silicon Valley. You go to Facebook, and you\u2019ll see a new Frank Gehry building, which is a one story building, parking at the base of 450,000 square footprints. As you think about that, that\u2019s 10 acres, with the park on top. ","You go to Apple\u2019s headquarters, it\u2019s 820,000 square feet, first floor with the park effectively in the middle of the ring. And you see there\u2019s over and over again, when you go to Samsung, Nvidea and other tenants. So, what we think is truly unique about the Farley building is the ability to deliver truly a horizontal campus, in New York what I said earlier, is on great roof deck space in the heart of the City, with views all around. So, but most of our business, what we do every day, what Glen does every day, it\u2019s really going after the tenants that are less than 100,000 square feet, in terms of what our normal tenant fee is. ","Steven Roth","Steve it's actually, as you would expect, as it always is. Demand is different submarket-to-submarket. And there are submarkets that we are focused on our tighter supply as supposed to some of the other submarkets. ","Steve Sakwa","And then I guess, Steve I know that the $1 billion as you talked about is over a multiyear period. So, maybe a little bit premature to sort of think about uses of capital. But, how do you sort of think about those use as a capital today? Is it geared for share buybacks, or is it geared for redevelopment, acquisitions? I mean, how would you sort of prioritize the use in capital?","Steven Roth","Yes, I agree with you. It is premature. ","Steve Sakwa ","And then I guess, just last question. And I realize it\u2019s early on the whole Amazon H 2Q. Just if you sort of think about the requirements that they led out. New York meet many of them that you talked about, but maybe housing and affordability of housing is kind of the issue. I mean, do you sort of any sense as to kind of how those priority stack up? And how do you think New York stacks up relative to some of the other cities?","Steven Roth","I think, that the process that Amazon is, and it hasn't marked down is truly a big. I don\u2019t think, we\u2019ve ever seen anything like this before. We\u2019ve got brother fighting, and it gets brother out there, to all these difference cities. There\u2019s 200 some more like different applicants. So we can\u2019t begin to predict the result, but we can\u2019t even begin to predict who\u2019s a final 5 or 10 is going to be.","Having said that, New York is obviously, we really know is the high cost area. I won\u2019t comment about how business friendly it is, we think it's very business friendly. We think transportation is amazing, we think the quality of the workforce is unparallel, we think that, there are not only our option, but there are other options that could satisfy even and even they\u2019re like Amazon. But, in terms of where that comes out, Steve, I don\u2019t know. ","Operator","And your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning. And certainly Steve good to have back on the call, and so vigor.","Steven Roth","Thank you.","Alexander Goldfarb","Two questions, how much does revolution are poised play into your billion dollars, I get the tax potential as far as would you guys look at the different stock positions and other assets that you may sell. How much of it is tied to whatever happens with Toys are both here and whatever happens with their Asia division versus both the $1 billion of sales in Toys are two separate discussions?","Steven Roth","I think your question is how much does the potential of $400 million tax write-off coming from Toys, shield $1 billion okay. And the answer is Joe.","Joseph Macnow","The $1 billion is the portion will retain without any utilization of the Toys write-off and none of it comes from Toys it\u2019s all from assets other than Toys.","Steven Roth","So well in terms of Toys being used as a shield to retain that $1 billion the answer is that icing on the cake we haven't used that at all in our internal budget.","Alexander Goldfarb","So then as a follow-up to that, so if you went hopefully Toys is resolved does that mean we should think about an additional amount of dispositions or you would use that shield for something else?","Steven Roth","Once again I can\u2019t predict that okay, I just can\u2019t predict that I mean we sell.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, we\u2019ll stick with\u2026","Steven Roth","Hang on, we sell assets from time to time for lots of different reasons, either we think we got to the level of maturity where we have created the value that we can that they are not in our core. For other miscellaneous reasons why we don't want either to take a large profit or because we no longer think they are useful or they no longer growing or we no longer want them and in a rare instance where even once in a while where we made a mistake, we don\u2019t really do get into sales based upon tax reasons, we try to do it based upon real estate business reasons.","So Toys potential of a Toys shield that shield going forward is just icing on the cake and you can remember we have a very big business. We've done $15 million or $17 million of transactions in the last recent years so this $400 million tax shield which will really on a capital gain basis be in a hundreds of millions of dollars of tax savings its really - it doesn't say this is not - this will be the tail wedding the door okay.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then Joe second question, you guys have obviously good reactions stock there you guys have put out a lot of releases on all the impacts over the past quarter that assessed this quarter. When we think about that 38 million of GAAP equivalent NOI that\u2019s going to come online over the next - within a year, year and a half. How should we think about that heading into next year does all of it come in next year to does some leak into 2019?","Joseph Macnow","It\u2019s the timing of the NOI interests.","Alexander Goldfarb","The GAAP NOI.","Steven Roth","Hang on, Joe is looking in through some papers.","Joseph Macnow","The NOI comes in $29 million fourth quarter of this year, $45 million next year, $8 million the year after. We gave up our quarter on Page 9 of the supplement. The EBITDA equivalent is $10 million in Q4 this year, $19 million in 2018, $8.5 million in 2019 again given by quarter on Page 9 of the supplement.","Alexander Goldfarb","And Joe that's GAAP or cash as I thinking about FFO.","Joseph Macnow","The second set of numbers I gave was GAAP, the first set of numbers I gave you was NOI cash. The first set of numbers totaled $84 million, the second set of numbers totaled $38 million. $38 million is the GAAP, $84 is the cash.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jed Reagan from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Jed Reagan","Steve first of all very glad to hear you're feeling a lot better.","Steven Roth","Thank you.","Jed Reagan","I guess along those lines has your thinking changed at all in terms of your day-to-day involvement with the company going forward and maybe if you can talk it all about the approach or timeline in terms of succession planning if that\u2019s evolving at all on your mind at the Board level?","Steven Roth","Obviously it\u2019s top of mind - in my mind then at the Board level, I mean obviously I\u2019m back nine I may even be on the back half of the back nine. Having said that, the Board is very involved in the future plan and the management team and the future management team of this company as I am I.","Having said that over the last number of years we had totally transformed this business. We have done and restructured it which we think has benefited enormously with the corporate's. That's something that I think the Board thought that I was the best person to do and we still have more to do so, I\u2019m not quite done yet and we still have more to do. Having said that, you can be assured that we have a robust succession plan and I don't think I have anything more to say then that.","Jed Reagan","Simply you guys provided some helpful cost details on the Farley project in the supplemental, just wondering if you\u2019re in a position to provide a stabilized yield expectation for that project?","Steven Roth","Not really our aspirations are high. We think it's a best piece of real estate in that jumbler in town so our aspirations are very high we think that the down side also yields a very acceptable return. We\u2019re not really ready to make predictions which the real estate market will use and so it's just let\u2019s us do our thing. We think we do it better than anybody let\u2019s do our thing.","Jed Reagan","And maybe last one appreciate the color on the One Penn timeline, can you offer any kind of timeline expectation for the two Penn redevelopment at this point?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is the two Penn redevelopment lives will be simple or complex and so right now we can\u2019t - it\u2019s inappropriate for us to give any information on two Penn right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Please go ahead.","Nick Yulico","Just a question about 666 Fifth, what your latest thoughts there and how that plan may evolve?","Steven Roth","That's an evolving plan, that\u2019s the first step. The second is it\u2019s a very, very attractive piece of real estate, I have said this many times before its overleveraged which is an issue. Our position we look upon our position in that we own 100% of the retail at the bottom building on Fifth Avenue we own 50% of the office building. We think the asset is brilliant well located.","The office building is over leveraged okay, the retail has leverage on it to but proportionate leverage okay. So our position in that building and we look upon it as if it\u2019s a mezz loan warrant where we have a relatively modest amount of capital in there for our 50% position in any event. There have been rumors in the marketplace more than rumors they have been published it in the marketplace about tearing the buildings down and doing all manner of fairly grand development schemes.","It\u2019s likely that those are not feasible so it's likely that the building will revert to an office building. And so we're working on that we're working on capital plans, we\u2019re working on venture arrangements et cetera so it\u2019s a work in process.","Nick Yulico","And so is that a situation where you would like to increase your ownership in the building rather than look to sell off your existence stake?","Steven Roth","I said last year or so maybe even longer than that that we were likely a seller into the grand scheme of the - grand scheme has gone away and I don't want to speculate on whether we are a buyer or seller or increasing our position in the deal. This building and our adventure are the subject of current discussions and that's leave it with that.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participation and you may now disconnect.","Steven Roth","Thanks everybody. And I appreciate very much your well wishes with respect to my health which is - I am fine, thanks.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen."],"21959":["Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) Q3 2013 Earnings Call November  5, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Catherine Creswell","Steven Roth - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of Executive Committee","Stephen W.

My name is Jeanine, and I'll be your operator for today's call. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Catherine Creswell","Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust's third quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our third quarter earnings release and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents, as well as our supplemental financial information package are available on our website, www.vno.com, under the Investor Relations section.","In these documents and during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, Form 10-Q and financial supplements. Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K, for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties.

On the call today from management for our opening comments are: Steven Roth, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; David Greenbaum, President of the New York division; Mitchell Schear, President of the Washington, DC division; Joseph Macnow, Chief Administrative Officer; and Stephen Theriot, Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room are Wendy Silverstein and Michael Franco, Executive Vice Presidents, and Co-Heads of Acquisitions and Capital Markets. I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thanks to you, Cathy. Good's morning, everyone. Welcome to Vornado's third quarter earnings call. I'd like to begin by reaffirming our commitment to our strategy of simplifying, pruning and focusing the business. We are making very good steady progress in that regard, and we will continue to do so.","As I've said before, in this market, we will buy carefully, and this year sell more than we buy. We will continue to focus internally where we have much to do and a lot to harvest. We will build cash reserves to further fortify our fortress balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities that will undoubtedly present themselves in the future. We had a very strong, very strong third quarter and I'm very pleased with our financial results. Our third quarter comparable FFO was 23.3% higher than last year's third quarter.","I'll briefly preview what David and Mitchell are going to share with you in a few minutes. Our New York business continues to put up very strong industry-leading metrics. Same-store EBITDA increased 7% and the mark-to-market's for New York office leasing were positive 8.9% cash and 8.0% GAAP. In Washington, the loss of income from the BRAC-related vacancies is the eye of the storm for our company. Truth be known, leasing is going slower than I would like, but it's pretty clear to us that the market has now bottomed. I believe, the vacant square footage in Washington is not valued at all in our stock, and therefore represents tremendous upside that we will realize as we lease up.","In Washington, we have completed the restructuring of the Skyline debt which Mitch will elaborate on in a few minutes. The restructuring bifurcated the existing $678 million loan into a senior $350 million, $132 per square foot position and a junior $328 million position, which is subordinate to capital we will invest to re-lease the property. The loan is been extended so that we now have 9 years of term, giving us plenty of time to realize value here. This is a very satisfactory result. At our very core, leasing is our business. Companywide, we leased 1.9 million square fe in the quarter in 131 transactions, with positive mark-to-market of 5.2% cash and 12.5% GAAP. The leasing performance of our best-in-class 2.4 million square-foot Manhattan Street retail portfolio deserves a special mention. Here we achieved mark-to-markets of 126% cash and 235% GAAP.","Year-to-date we leased 5.2 million square feet companywide in 436 transactions with positive mark-to-markets of 6.2% cash and 13.5% GAAP.","In 2012 and 2013 so far, we have sold $3.5 billion of non-core assets of which $800 million was used in like-kind exchanges to partially fund $2.2 billion of acquisitions during the same period. All of these $2.2 billion of acquisitions were in Manhattan and all are of highest quality.","Here are some specifics on recent acquisitions. On September 30, we announced that a joint venture in which we have a co-controlling 20.1% interest acquired 650 Madison Avenue, a 594,000 Class A office and retail tower located on the full Western block front of Madison Avenue from 59th Street to 60th Street. The property contains 523,000 square feet of office space and 71,000 square feet of retail space. Half of the office space is Polo, Ralph Lauren's world headquarters. The retail space is primarily leased to Crate and Barrel for its 61,000 square-foot Manhattan flagship. The purchase price for this property was $1.295 billion, which was financed with a new $800 million, 7-year 4.39% interest-only loan. We are co-managing and co-leasing this property.","On October 4, we announced the acquisition of a 92.5% interest in 655 Fifth Avenue located at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street. The price for this acquisition of our share was $277.5 million. The property contains 575,500 square feet, which is entirely net leased to Ferragamo and of course this asset includes their flagship Fifth Avenue store. On October 15, we announced that we acquired for $194 million land and air rights for 137,000 zoning square feet, thereby completing this assemblage of our 220 Central Park South site in Manhattan. This transaction will allow development to begin on a 950-foot luxury residential condominium tower containing 472,000 zoning square feet. The to-be constructed tower will have 140 feet of direct unobstructed Central block views and will be designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects. While it took almost 8 years to complete this assemblage, this site is the best in town and it was certainly well worth the time. Values have tremendously risen during that time and the land alone here is worth well more, well more than double our $500 odd million economic core.","On dispositions in the third quarter we completed the sale of 3 non-core assets with proceeds of $75.8 million. We have also completed our exit from JCPenney, which resulted in a $38.1 million net loss in the quarter, which was largely offset by the net gain of $31.7 million on the sale of a marketable security. So far in the fourth quarter, we closed on the sale of the Harlem Park land for $66 million, resulting in a net gain of $23 million.","With the above dispositions, in 2013, we've sold $1.8 billion of non-core assets. This is on top of $1.7 billion sold in 2012, and we currently have in the market for sale, more than $500 million of assets and we have more than double that amount in the on-deck circle.","We continue to focus on the value creating opportunities we have internally, such as: the redevelopment of 2 34th Street buildings -- the 725,000 square foot 330 West 34th Street and 420,000 square foot 7 West 34th Street. Both of these buildings will be repositioned for today's creative class and technology tenants. The Marriott Marquis retail and signage project at the bulls eye of the Bow Tie in Times Square where construction barricades are going up as we speak. The $1.4 million square-foot Springfield Mall renovation, which is under construction for our holiday 2014 opening. The transformation of 280 Park Avenue at 48th Street in partnership with SL Green, which is in full construction and will transform this asset into an A plus-plus location on Park Avenue. The 699-unit residential project in Pentagon City with Whole Foods market as its base, which will go into construction this quarter. The Hotel Penn; and the Pennsylvania Station District; and of course, as I just mentioned, 220 Central Park South.","Let me end my remarks with the following observation. The markets that we operate in all seem to be improving in our favor and that's a very, very good thing. In New York, retail sales and rental rates are white hot. Office leasing, as I said in last quarter's call, is surely heading in the direction of a landlords' market. Washington is bottoming with signs of green shoots. The debt markets continue to be very robust with rates just above historic lows. The assets we have chosen to sell are receiving a lot of interest from many potential buyers. The only market that is giving us heartburn is the acquisitions market for properties we want to buy, which is extremely high. And so we're proceeding here with great caution.","Now I will turn it over to CFO, Steve Theriot to cover our financial results.","Stephen W. Theriot","Thank you, Steve. Yesterday we reported comparable funds from operations of $1.27 per share versus $1.03 for the prior year's third quarter, a 23.3% increase. Comparable EBITDA was $416.5 million, ahead of last year's third quarter by $55.4 million or 15.3%. Our New York division produced $251 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, that's a running rate for our New York business of $1 billion a year, quite a milestone. New York division EBITDA, about 60% of our total was $47.4 million or 23.3% ahead of last year's third quarter, primarily driven by a 7% same-store increase, property acquisitions and a $12.1 million share of a lease termination fee. Please remember that consistent with our past practice, lease termination fees are excluded from same-store results.","Our Washington business produced $86.9 million of comparable EBITDA, which is $1.9 million behind last year's third quarter, primarily due to effects of BRAC move outs and sluggish leasing environment in Washington. Washington's year-to-date EBITDA is $17.7 million behind last year. We continue to expect that Washington's full-year 2013 comparable EBITDA will be approximately $10 million to $15 million lower than 2012.","Our strips and malls business produced $56.8 million of comparable EBITDA this quarter, which is $3.7 million or a strong 7.1% ahead of last year's third quarter. Our New York and Washington businesses together with our strips and malls account for approximately 90% of our company's comparable EBITDA. This is our focus and our core business.","Total FFO was $1.12 per share, down from $1.34 in the prior year's third quarter, resulting from noncomparable items being a loss of $27.6 million this quarter, as compared to income of $58.8 million in the same quarter last year. This year's third quarter included $22.3 million of negative noncash FFO from Toys, representing our share of the loss of the seasonal Toys business, compared to $2.4 million of FFO in the prior year's third quarter.","As we noted in our 2012 annual report, and our last quarter's call, based on current conditions, our accounting is asymmetrical, as we recognize our share of Toys' noncash losses, but as of now, not recognizing our share of noncash income. This has had the effect of reducing our GAAP carrying value.","As Steve mentioned, we disposed of our remaining interest in JCPenney's recognizing a $38.1 million loss. This noncomparable loss was offset by a $31.7 million noncomparable net gain from the sale of a marketable security. With the exit from JCPenney and the sale of other marketable securities, simplification is moving along and we're now down to marketable securities with a market value of $210.6 million at September 30, of which all but $3.1 million represents our investment in Lincoln Realty Trust. I'm sorry, Lexington Realty Trust. Thank you, Steve.","FFO in last year's third quarter included onetimers totaling income of $63.8 million comprised of $19.7 million from the after-tax net gain on the sale of the Mart's Canadian Trade Shows, $16.8 billion of FFO from LNR, which was sold in April, 2013, $11.7 million from the gain on the redemption of perpetual preferred securities and $15.6 million of FFO from discontinued operations. Please see our press release or the overview in the MD&A on Page 43 of our 10-Q for a complete summary of noncomparable items.","And with that, I'll turn it over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business.","David R. Greenbaum","Steve, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin with a brief overview of what we're seeing here in the New York City marketplace. New York City feels good. Traffic on the streets is bustling and the sidewalks are overcrowded. We like traffic. When it's hard to get around that means people are at work, shopping in the stores and filling the hotels, all great for Vornado's New York business. This buzz of activity we're feeling is, in fact, reflected in the market statistics. Private sector jobs are up some 90,000 year-to-date, 52 million tourists will visit the city this year, a record number; and sales volumes in our flagship Stores, are at or approaching new heights.","Manhattan office leasing activity was strong in the third quarter, at over 6 million square feet, producing some 1.6 million square feet of positive absorption, reducing the availability rate by 40 basis points to 12.3%. The preliminary reports I read last evening for the month of October, show continuing strong activity with the availability rate coming down in October by an additional 20 basis points. At the beginning of the year, there were 83 blocks of space larger than 100,000 square feet available. That number is now down to 68. While value space is still the key demand driver, we're also seeing real activity in the high-value triple digit market. In the city, there have been 50 leases this year signed at over $100 per square foot, 6 of those are ours.","In the third quarter, we signed 37 leases for a total of 396,000 square feet, taking our leasing year-to-date to 1,851,000 square feet. Again, this quarter, we had strong activity from tenants new to or expanding in New York; about 25% of our activity, or 93,000 of the 396,000 square feet. That's real, real growth in this market. Our average starting rent this quarter was a healthy $62.04, with very strong positive mark-to-markets of 8.9% cash and 8% GAAP. The average lease term was 6.7 years with TIs at $41.54. Our office occupancy rate held steady at 95.9%. But there is an important asterisk to this number. At the very end of the quarter, we signed a lease termination agreement for Gleacher & Company's 84,000 square feet at 1290 Avenue of the Americas. I'll give you a bit more on that later in my remarks. If not for that lease termination, our occupancy for the quarter actually would have been 30 basis points higher at 96.2%.","Third quarter leasing activity was highlighted by a 124,000 square feet of leasing at 666 Fifth Avenue. When we came in to this asset, some 2 years ago, it had been off the radar for years because of its broken capital structure. We came in and recapitalized this building and have since successfully leased 200,000 square feet, and are in current negotiations for an additional 50,000 feet. Taking account of the Citibank space, which will be coming back to us in August of next year, we have about 330,000 square feet to go. This quarter, we completed 3 leases in the building, highlighted by a 57,000 square foot lease with the commercial brokerage firm Colliers International. I've mentioned in the past, how important it is to our relationship with the brokerage community to have the major brokerage houses as tenants in our portfolio, and we now have 3 of the majors in New York: Jones Lang LaSalle's Headquarters at 330 Madison Avenue, Cushman and Wakefield at 1290 Avenue of the Americas and we now welcome Colliers at 666 Fifth Avenue. We also signed at 666 a 56,000 square-foot lease with The Limited Companies for its Victoria's Secret division. We have a strong relationship with The Limited Companies. They in fact are headquartered in our 1740 Broadway property, occupying 467,000 square feet.","Activity at 1290 Avenue in the Americas has continued to really heat up, now that our transformative lobby renovation program is complete. We have many brokers telling us that 1290 is now the best building on Avenue of the Americas. In the base of the building, we were facing some 325,000 square feet coming back to us by way of the Microsoft lease expiration and Gleacher & Company's financial issues. This quarter, we signed a lease termination agreement with Gleacher, in which they paid us 4 years of rent, $19.5 million, to surrender their 84,000 square-foot lease. We currently are in late stage negotiations with 2 tenants for approximately 150,000 square feet. Adding to the 106,000 square foot State Street deal we talked about on the last conference call, in advance of the Microsoft lease expiration early next year, we expect to lease some 250,000 plus square feet of the 325,000 expiring.","Looking ahead, we have Morrison & Foerster's 166,000 square-foot lease expiring in May, 2014. These are great floors at the top of the building with views of Central Park. Warner Music also recently announced that they will be relocating out of 1290 to a cheaper space at 1633 Broadway. This is a real opportunity for us because Warner's lease has over 3.5 years remaining, so we have plenty of time to relet the space and realize value. Having just completed our leasing-marketing center at 1290, we have a lot of activity here and are very excited about our prospects.","At 280 Park Avenue, the transformation program we're undertaking with SL Green is now really visible to everyone driving by on Park Avenue. The barricades are now down revealing the full block-long lobby, which will be opening prior to year-end. Our strategy at 280 Park has been to target the smaller financial firms in the 25,000 to 50,000 square foot range to maximize the rent. This year, we have completed 150,000 square feet of leasing activity and currently are working on 2 additional deals for another 80,000 feet. 280 Park Avenue is as good as it gets: prime Park Avenue with JPMorgan Chase's world headquarters as its direct next door neighbor.","Let me now turn to our Manhattan Street retail portfolio where we were active on the acquisition front, as Steve mentioned, having acquired 655 Fifth Avenue at the northeast corner of 52nd Street with 50-feet of frontage on Fifth Avenue, a 57,500 square-foot retail and office property, net leased to Ferragamo. We also acquired 966 Third Avenue, a small retail building, which is leased to McDonald's. Importantly, this asset sits between 2 of our existing properties, which all combined now gives us 100-feet of retail frontage on Third Avenue at 58th Street, opposite 731 Lexington Avenue, the Bloomberg Tower.","As Steve has also already mentioned, we completed 9 street retail leases this quarter, totaling 35,000 square feet with very strong mark-to-markets, 126% cash and 235.7% GAAP. This street retail business is a jewel in our New York portfolio. We took our occupancy rate up 80 basis points here to 97.1%. On Madison Avenue at our 40 East 66th Street property, we signed a lease with John Varvatos replacing Dennis Basso, and at 1133 Third Avenue at 66th Street for the space formerly occupied by the Gap, we signed leases this quarter with Nike Running Door and Carlo Pazolini. We're now working on one more lease there which will complete the re-leasing of this full block property.","Highlights of this quarter's activity also include a lease with U.S. Polo at 1540 Broadway. This completes the re-leasing and repositioning of our 1540 Broadway, Times Square property. Directly across the street in the Bow Tie at the Marriott Marquis Times Square, construction is now underway to create 45,000 square feet of prime Times Square retail space and the largest LED sign in Times Square. To give you a feel, the sign will be the length of a football field, 8 stories high. The Hotel Pennsylvania continues to capitalize our New York's record tourism with third quarter occupancy of 96.9% and a 12% increase in RevPAR compared to the third quarter last year, which takes it to the highest levels it has ever been.","Turning now to the $3.5 million square-foot Chicago Merchandise Mart building. This quarter, we leased 48,000 square feet. Motorola Google's fit out of their 600,000 square feet is substantially complete, their 2,500 employees will be moving in by the early part of the new year, which is beginning to bring a real buzz to the building. There are significant opportunities in this building to continue the conversion of several 100,000 square feet of underperforming showroom and trade show space to office space for both traditional users and creative tech tenants.","To conclude my remarks, let me summarize the entire New York division. We had a very strong quarter. Our key performance metrics are industry-leading, with same-store EBITDA increases for the overall division of 8.6% cash and 7% GAAP. Isolating just the New York Office business, our same-store EBITDA increased 9.3% cash and 7.7% GAAP. And let me emphasize, as Stephen Theriot mentioned that our same-store numbers exclude the onetime lease termination fee, paid by Gleacher.","And now I'll turn over the call to Mitchell Schear to cover Washington.","Mitchell N. Schear","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. I will start with an overview of the third quarter and then talk more broadly about the market and how we're thinking about our business. Our Washington business had an exceptionally large volume of leasing in the third quarter. In a slow leasing market we're particularly excited about what we accomplished. In the quarter, we leased a total of 1,076,000 square feet in 57 office and retail transactions. Year-to-date, we have leased 1,691,000 square feet in 132 office and 40 retail transactions. We completed the 2 largest transactions in the Washington market this quarter. One was the largest lease in Northern Virginia and the other was the largest in DC. In Northern Virginia, at Skyline, we signed a 182,700 square-foot lease with the United States Government to house the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This was one of the most hotly contested awards of the year and was the largest lease in Northern Virginia in an existing building this year.","We expect the agency to occupy their new space by June. That's really fast for a user of this size. This 418,000 square foot building was our single biggest concentration of BRAC vacancy and is now 65% leased. This lease also reduced our overall BRAC exposure by 12% and brings us to the half way mark in resolving BRAC. Other pieces of our Skyline repositioning strategy are also falling into place including having now finalized our Skyline debt restructuring. Joe will talk more about this in a moment.","In addition to new leasing, we are very focused on retaining our tenants. Since January, we have renewed 717,400 square feet in our portfolio. The largest of these renewals was completed in early August with the global law firm Sibley for 289,000 square feet at The Investment Building, a property that we manage, lease and own a 5% interest in partnership with institutional investors advised by JPMorgan. Although this lease will not expire until 2015, we renewed Sibley early at a slightly expanded footprint and anchored the building to 2031. Our apartment business in Arlington and Georgetown continues to perform very well. Our 2,400 unit portfolio is 97.2% occupied and third quarter EBITDA is 2.4% ahead of last year's third quarter.","Overall, office leases signed in the third quarter generated a GAAP mark-to-market of positive 3.8% and a cash mark-to-market of negative 1.1%, a very satisfactory result given the difficult market we're in. Our occupancy was unchanged from Q2 at 83.6%. I would like to note that with the heavy volume of leasing this quarter, occupancy would have been 120 basis points higher, but for the fact that we brought the 26.5% occupied, 298,000 square foot 251 18th Street building in Crystal City back into service this quarter after its renovation. Tenant improvements and leasing commissions for leases signed in the third quarter were 9.8% of starting rents, which is significantly lower than the 12% for 2012 and the 16.7% for the first half of 2013.","In addition to our focus on office leasing, we continue to add to the vibrancy of the Crystal City neighborhood. Over the last decade, we have transformed Crystal City with the addition of dynamic -- with the addition of a dynamic retail experience at the street level of many of our buildings. We attract true destination makers and celebrity chefs and unique amenities. And Crystal City draws thousands of people to its many cycling and running events, wine festivals and theater and art events. Continuing our momentum, we recently completed 2 new brand builder leases, 1 with top chef Spike Mendleson and the other with TechShop, a hub for investors and entrepreneurs.","Now let me turn to what we're seeing on the ground in terms of office leasing and how it fits into our business here. The Washington market has been on pause. We have been through BRAC, sequestration and the most recent shutdown showdown. And if I sound like a frustrated taxpayer, I am. Despite the confusion that has come to define our nation's government, the Washington's economy remains resilient with rising housing prices, which were up 5.6% in the 12 months ending June 2013, low unemployment currently at 5.7% and a growing regional economy. And we're starting to see green shoots. The brokerage reports show only slight positive net absorption at 610,000 square feet so far this year, but compared to the negative 2.6 million square feet in 2012, a good sign. And more importantly, our leasing team has seen a palpable uptick in tours and activity in the past weeks and months. This is a very good sign. Consistent with recent trends, we're in a value driven tenant market, which plays well to our portfolio where we can offer good value solution inside the Beltway and in fact on the shores of the Potomac River. Further, we're now seeing some large important requirements starting to troll the market. Economists project a 20% surge in professional services job growth over the next 5 years in Washington, which is expected to result in an aggregate of 143,800 new jobs by the end of 2017. This could translate into over 25 million square feet of new office absorption. So with this demand potential, combined with low levels of new supply, typically signals the beginning of a sustained recovery. The theme of our Washington business is value creation opportunity. Over 2 million square feet of vacant office space is both the bad news and the good news. The bad news is that our earnings are currently being penalized by over $70 million a year. It's a big number. The good news is that as we lease the space, our earnings growth will be enormous. Someone famous once said, \"Trouble equals opportunity\". Over the years, we've been experts at solving this particular equation. Please remember that in 2006 to 2009, we re-leased over 2.2 million square feet of space in Crystal City after the PTO, USAir and the EPA relocated. It's also interesting to note that since 2004, Crystal City rents are up by over 30%. We are actively teeing up our significant development pipeline. We've more than 7 million square feet of developable inventory in Rosslyn, Crystal City, Pentagon City and in the District on land that we own free and clear.","In September, we received government approvals for the last track of undeveloped land in Pentagon City, 10 acres that's sit directly across from the Pentagon, which we named Penn Place. It is now approved for 5 buildings totaling over 2 million square feet. The location is unparalleled, between the Pentagon and Simon's Fashion Center, which by the way, we own a 7.5% interest in. And it's adjacent to our soon to go under construction 699 unit residential tower, which will have a Whole Foods market at its base. The Penn Place approval is an important piece of our overall development vision. Together with our new apartments, Penn Place is a natural extension of our existing 8 million-square-foot portfolio in Crystal City, located just 2 blocks away. With Crystal City and Pentagon City, we're creating 1 blended district with deep complementing concentrations of office, residential and retail.","Arlington County's new light rail system is proceeding to further the physical connection. We're the dominant owner of this newly combined Crystal City, Pentagon City district and we expect demand for all of our holdings in this area to rise as a result of the cross benefits. And remember, we're on the shores of the Potomac, just a stone throw from DC.","Thank you, very much. I'll now turn it over to Joe Macnow.","Joseph Macnow","Thanks, Mitchell. Let me first touch on our strip shopping centers and malls, both of which had a strong quarter. Strip shopping center occupancy was 94.3% at quarter end, up 20 basis points in the second quarter, and up 70 basis points from last year's third quarter. Occupancy of the remaining malls was 94%, up 50 basis points from the second quarter, and 140 basis points from last year's third quarter. We leased 288,000 square feet at the strip shopping centers with a positive mark-to-market of 13.7% GAAP and 7.4% cash. We leased 243,000 square feet at the malls, with a positive mark-to-market of 11.4% GAAP and 3.6% cash, a strong, strong quarter for our strip shopping centers and malls.","Now turning to capital markets. As of today, we have $3 billion in liquidity, comprised of $800 million of cash and $2.2 billion of undrawn revolving credit facilities; overall, $400 million better than at the start of the year. And that's after using $500 million for recent acquisitions and debt repayments. Our objective is to build liquidity which will happen as we continue to sell non-core assets and finance-core assets. Our consolidated debt-to-enterprise value is 36.6%, and our consolidated debt-to-EBITDA is 7.0x.","As Steve mentioned, in October, we completed the restructuring of the $678 million, 5.74% Skyline mortgage loan. The loan has been separated into 2 tranches. A senior $315 million position, which as Steve said is $132 square-foot, and a junior $328 million position. The maturity date has been extended from February, 2017 to February, 2022 and we have a 1 year extension option. The effective interest rate is 2.965% for the term of the loan. The capital we will invest to re-lease the property will be seen in our $328 million junior position, in other words, it will come in right over $132 a foot. Our debt mix is balanced, with 86.5% fixed-rate with a weighted average of 5.03% and 13.5% floating with the current weighted average interest rate of 2.32%. Remaining 2013 and '14 maturities are just $145 million. As we refinance our fixed-rate portfolio at lower rates, even after the season, a significant increase in earnings will results. At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] John Guinee from Stifel is on the line with a question.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Wonderfully active quarter. 3 quick questions in 1. One, Steve, if you could talk about the upcoming mayoral change and how do you feel about that? Two, can someone give a little more color on Hotel Pennsylvania? And then three, what sort of value do you think the street should assign to the current vacancy in the DC portfolio on a per square foot basis?","Steven Roth","The election is today. So we will know I guess, tonight, what the polls are predicting. The polls are predicting very strongly that Mr. De Blasio will be the next Mayor. So let me make a few comments about this gentleman. #1, he is tall, really tall. I think he may be the tallest politician in the land. He's a strong leader. He is very intelligent. He is obviously a caring man, he cares for people, which is very important in this, especially in this city. He is a very professional politician and that's obvious to the people who don't know him and how he rose to the top in a very, very long and contested primary. So this is a man, who is a professional politician, knows the game, has been there before although, not as visible as some of his predecessors. He is intelligent and caring. He is a Clinton Democrat and I think, we all know what that means. So we are quite optimistic that he will be a good steward of the city. This city is in a phenomenal shape. It has been improving. It is certainly the most important city in the U.S. And obviously, one of the most in the world. And we are optimistic that soon to be elected Mayor De Blasio will be a good steward for the legacy of New York. Your second -- by the way, there may be a little bit of tax increase here and there around the edges. I mean, that's happening in every major city in the world is basically under fiscal pressure, as is the Federal Government. So in return for what we get here, we're happy to pay a little bit more. But just a little bit. Your second question was the Hotel Pennsylvania. I think we talked about that at length in the past. That's a site, which is a great site in the heart of our massive Penn Plaza holdings. It's an important asset. It's currently a 1,700 room hotel, through a youler [ph] procedure and the property is now fully approved for an approximate 3 million square foot office building, which is in the configuration of the financial services headquarters. We had a handshake on a deal with such an animal, some short years ago, which fell through in the financial crisis. So we do have a fully approved site for a building which is not possible to build right now, because there is not a tenant for it, and the economics are not there. So although it's very valuable and very nice to have that, approval, and every once in a while, we get people who come by and cruise and sort of tease us about the prospect of a new build on that site. The high likelihood with respect to the Hotel Pennsylvania is that we will spend a -- I would mention it somewhere over $250 million and maybe even into the $300 million in repositioning the hotel, renovating and upgrading the rooms, and most importantly of all, transforming the public spaces of that hotel into something with restaurants and life, which will benefit not only the hotel and whole hotel patrons, but the entire district, where we own 7-odd million-square-foot of office space. That is probably -- we're tardy on that decision. But it's probably pretty a imminent decision to start moving forward okay? We may very well do it in colleague with a professional hotel operator and that's probably the most likely outcome.","Your third question, John, was about the value of -- what we think the value of the vacant space, which is dimensioning over 2 million square feet in Washington, is valued at our stock and I said in my prepared remarks, I think its valued in our stock at 0. What do I think it should be valued at I'm not -- that's not a question that, I think, I'm going to handle. But obviously, all space even if it's empty, has future prospects and is worth something. But the way I do the math, the vacancy in our Washington business is valued at 0 and clearly over time, and hopefully not that long a time, we will lease that space up and that's a huge value creator for us.","Operator","Next call comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","2 questions here. The first question, Steve. You guys, obviously have chopped a lot of wood recently. Skyline 220, I mean, the list goes on, but there is a lot that really happened recently. As we looked, you talk about possibly another billion dollars of dispositions, $500 million in the works and another $500 million on debt. As we look out over the next 6 to 12 months, what do you think we're going to see, is it going to be some of the big ticket items to clean up or is it going to be more individual assets? What should we be looking for?","Stephen W. Theriot","Well, I agree with you. We have chopped a lot of wood and I appreciate very much, your recognition of that. And the team, that's assembled in the room here, and the company's working very hard at the chopping of wood. I think, your estimate of a year or a 1.5 year from now is we expect to accomplish an awful lot in that 1.5 year. We have, I think I said $0.5 billion of assets in the market now, we have double that amount, $1.5 billion in the on deck circle and maybe even more than that. We expect and we're hopeful that in an 18-month time frame, we will complete all of that. We can run into speed bumps along the way. We can get an asset -- that some of these assets are clinkers, obviously, and not in our core. So we may get into a situation where we can't get the pricing we want or something else happens. But by and large, our mission is to prune the business down to the core and we're working very hard to do that, and I would be very hopeful that all of those assets that we have teed up will be transacted between now and 1.5 year from now. I think, you alluded to in your question, is there going to be something bigger than that? And I don't have any idea what you mean Alexander.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","What I mean, there are some big items that's maybe that's better for offline.","Stephen W. Theriot","No, I mean, there are some big things in there, obviously we've got an isolated building out in San Francisco called 555 California Street, which is certainly the best building in the financial district of San Francisco. Undoubtedly the best building in the entire city and arguably, one of the top couple of buildings in the entire state. But that's an isolated building. It's complicated, we have a complex structure. But that's a building that is great. It's improving, rents are going up. The team, David and the team are handling the rent thing well. But it's not a building that we intend to own forever. We've said that publicly. We got another big asset on California called the Beverly Connection. That's not an asset also that we've [indiscernible] so those are very large numbers and they are certainly, in our sights.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. The next question is, maybe a Joe question. Trea [ph] is set to expire next December '14. And just speaking to some commercial insurance brokers, they were noting that policies can't be written with the option of if Congress fixes it after the fact you get retro coverage. You guys self insure for part of the Boneda [ph] portfolio, part of the Alexander's, how does this factor in? Do you think there's going to be much pricing impact if it looks like you're going to have to buy it in the open market or how are you handling this?","Joseph Macnow","Alex, first, let me just correct one thing. We do not self insure, we reinsure everything that our captive takes on in liability, other than NBCA, the Nuclear Biological et cetera, et cetera. If Trea does not get extended, we now have $4 billion of terrorism coverage, that will equate to our pecking order in being able to buy the equivalent insurance, if Trea is not there, at 15% of that or some $600 million. But if Trea is not there, for sure, that insurance is going to be much more expensive than it is today.","Operator","Next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Steve and Mitchell, I just wanted to come back to some sort of the DC comments, Steve, I think in your opening remarks, you talked about market has bottomed, but then later on you talked about bottoming with green shoots and I'm just trying to get a perspective of, as we look forward to 2014, in terms of what the pipeline looks like to get to our arms around both sort of the vacancy, within Crystal City and the BRAC releasing and how we should think about EBITDA heading into 2014? But then, just more broadly about when we see that -- when we can start to see that turn and really -- is it bottom in the fourth quarter or is it bottoming where we can still see some slippage? And what sort of gives you the confidence, heading into next year?","Stephen W. Theriot","I think, in our remarks, Michael, both Mitchell and I said that the market is bottoming. I won't quibble with the terminology, the difference bottoming and bottomed. I'm not that exacting. Markets make bottoms by basically, they jiggle around a little bit, the real issue is we're pretty sure that it's bottomed or bottoming, we're pretty sure that is going to jiggle. How quickly we will jump off that bottom and how quickly we will fill the hole of the $70 odd million, maybe even $80 million, of -- that which is the EBITDA cost of the vacancy in Washington, it's something that sort of unknowable, because the demand is not yet robust. So -- and I also said in my opening remarks, that I'm disappointed with the pace of leasing down there. One of the things that's our job is to be totally transparent and if we -- so I'm not the least bit bashful to tell you that I am disappointed. I would love that it would be different. I can't predict -- then maybe I'm going to throw it over to Mitchell and let him stick his neck out -- I can't predict whether it will be 2 years from now or 3 years from now or God forbid longer. I don't think it will be longer. Mitchell also said, sort of subtly in his remarks, that we are now starting to see for the first time in a couple of years or 3 years or whatever it is, some fairly large elephants trolling the market, looking for space. We feel that we can compete aggressively for those elephants. We have the space and we have the ability to compete pricewise. So the long and the short of it is that we feel that we have bottomed. We might jiggle down a $1 million or $2 million, a $1 million here or there in the EBITDA area. We're not able or we're not so adventurous that we can predict what the ramping up will be off the bottom. I have also said that I believe, as I do the math, the vacancy in Washington is valued at 0 in our stock. So basically, that's a sort of a way of saying when you buy our stock, you get that couple of million feet, 2.5 million feet of vacancy for free. It's not worth 0 and clearly enormous values will be created as we rent up that space over the next number of, hopefully, short years. Mitchell do, you have anything else to add?","Mitchell N. Schear","Steve, the only thing I would add is, I totally agree with you that we're -- we just can't possibly predict. And I'm obviously on the ground and in the trenches every day. So I think, I completely agree with the notion that we are bottoming. We too would like to know what the trajectory will be. So we're fighting it out in the trenches, deal-by-deal, space-by-space. As I mentioned in my remarks earlier, we are starting to see really a palpable increase of activity. I think, when sequestration came upon us in earlier in the year, I think there really was sort of a moment in time that you might liken to what was going to happen when we hit Y2K. People weren't quite sure so they just sort of held on. And now that we've gotten through it, and we keep seeing job growth on the private sector side and we see some loosening up, we are pleased with what we're seeing, but we're obviously going to continue to monitor it, on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.","Stephen W. Theriot","Let me tack on 1 or 2 more thoughts, Michael. The first is, we have a large and important business in Washington. We are the largest owner down there by a factor of 2, maybe even more than 2. The bull's-eye of our business is Crystal City. Crystal City is one of the brilliantly located pieces of real estate, it's big, it's important. It's got scale. It's on -- It's contiguous to Reagan Airport on the shores of the Potomac, it's 7 minutes from the district. It has, it will be, when we figure out these and re-rent and transform and continue, it is going to be one of the great investments ever made. We're already $2 billion ahead on the investment, notwithstanding the vacancies. or maybe even $3 million ahead. So that's number 1. We are very, very confident of the, I guess, the slang would be the dirt that we own. The second thing is that Mitchell has the -- an infinite amount of resources, both human and financial, to work down there and to accomplish his goals, which are leasing the space. We have a great team down there on the leasing side. We have a great team on the development side. And Mitchell, quite frankly is under -- Mitchell's policy down there is we take no prisoners. We will compete aggressively in the trenches for every single deal.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just a second question. Just to clarify some of the stuff that you have on the market. I think you talked about the $500 million plus another $1 billion or more, sort of on deck. Does that include security stakes or the private companies stakes, or in the case of Lexington the $200 million or the case of Toys, which is carrying $350 million [indiscernible]. Is that in there at all or is it all sort of assets? And then just clarify, if that is your share, when you're talking about these dollars, or gross?","Stephen W. Theriot","Hang on, I'm looking at a piece of paper. The answer is a very specific answer to the question, is we have mentioned we have $500 million of assets for -- in the market now, that includes neither toys nor any securities. In the -- I also mentioned, we have doubled that amount in the on-deck circle. That would -- that number, which would indicate $1 billion, would not include either Toys nor Lexington.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So both of those are the part of a plan to eventually liquidate and could come in.","Stephen W. Theriot","I'm sorry, say again, Michael?","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Both of those will be part of a plan to simplify and could occur, it's just not necessarily that they are on-deck per se?","Stephen W. Theriot","Yes. The answer is that the numbers that we read in this call are intended to be assets, which are likely to be able to be transacted. As we've said, Toys is proving to be quite difficult to exit. And so, and also we can't predict what the price will be right now. So it would be disingenuous for us to say that it's in that number. So it's not. So anyway, let me just say, once again for clarity, our position on those 2 assets that you mentioned, Toys is, from our point of view, definitely a seller, and we have said that it's proving very difficult to accomplish that objective. Lexington, I think it's best said for Lexington is that we are not a forever holder of Lexington.","Unknown Executive","S Michael, the second part of your question is, was that our share of the numbers Steve talked about? The answer is absolutely, yes.","Operator","We have Steve Sakwa from ISI Group on line with the questions.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Steve, I guess I wanted to ask about kind of the acquisition market, obviously, it's difficult for you guys to put money out. And I'm just wondering have you guys sort of rethought or gone back and looked at your underwriting and kind of rethought the rent growth that you might be using in the markets? And I'm wondering, the rent growth that you're using kind of, versus, maybe the winning buyers. How far off do you think you are, or is it just they're willing to accept much lower returns than you guys are today?","Stephen W. Theriot","That's a very complicated question. First of all, we are not quite as formulaic as your question indicates. We basically -- and I think, I mentioned that in the last 2 years, every single asset we have bought has been in Manhattan. And every single asset that we have bought has been of the highest quality. So there's lots of -- our basic outlook on investing is, what's an asset is going to be worth in 3,5,7 years from now, not at what it's going to be worth in the next quarter. So that's step 1. Step 2 is, as I've said, and I think as I read the transcript of other folks' calls, everybody seems to agree that the price of assets is high. And that doesn't mean they're not going to go higher. But clearly the price of assets is high. So the buy decision now is much more complicated than at other times. So it's one of the philosophies that I live by, Steve, is that, if you take a 10-year cycle, there is 2 or 3 years which are definitely the times to be buying. And by the way, those are the times when you wake up in the morning and your stomach is in a knot because of fear. That's the buy cycle. Then there are 2 or 3 years at the other end of that, that dumb bell, which are clearly the sell times. And everything in middle, where it's sort of in between. And so we're clearly not in the years, which are the easy buys. We are probably pretty close to the years that are probably the sale, but I can't -- and I'm not making a call. So the answer to your question is we don't do it formulaically. We have said clearly that we will buy selectively. And we said clearly that we'll be a net seller and probably even a very substantial net seller over the next short period of time. Michael Franco, who runs our acquisitions and Wendy. Do you have guys anything else to say?","Michael J. Franco","No. I think that to your question, certainly in New York, the amount of capital from core funds and foreign sources has been significant and probably an overwhelming factor, and I think those sources are -- probably have a lower cost of capital than players like us on the margins. So that's a determining factor and I think that trend is going to continue. So I think, it will continue to be tough to buy high quality assets at prices that we deem as attractive.","Stephen W. Theriot","And that's okay, we have patience. And as I've said also, 1 of our business strategies is to build cash for the inevitable opportunities that will be coming, we just don't know exactly when they're coming.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, just to clarify. And there was lot of numbers on the DC market. But on page 32 of the supplemental, you kind of show that the overall occupancy rate in DC was sort of flat sequentially, but it would have gone down if you took out Skyline. And I think, Mitchell, you said you brought on 1818. Does that account for, I guess, the lion's share of that decline or are we just seeing kind of, move outs in other parts of the DC portfolio, that were timing issues?","Mitchell N. Schear","Yes. Steve, but for -- the bringing that building back on that was that 26% leased. The occupancy would've been 120 basis points higher or flat.","Unknown Executive","S And it was 251 18th Street, Steve is that you're referring to.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, Sorry. Thank you.","Unknown Executive","Does that answer your question?","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, it does.","Operator","We have Michael Knott from Green Street Advisors on the line with question.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Few questions on DC. Curious, just on the EBITDA range seems still kind of wide for being this deep in the year, just curious on that. And then do you expect to give '14 guidance at some point on DC or was that just a onetime event with what's happened in DC last couple of years? And then, my, I guess more important question on DC is I'm just curious, Mitchell you've talked about all of the things that have stalled your market's progress. Just curious, if the next hit from the next round of sequestration and the next debt showdown, will any of those continue to stunt your market or do you think those kind of shocks are already factored in to some extent?","Stephen W. Theriot","Let me take the first, Michael and then Mitchell can take the second. I agree with you, the 10 to 15 is a little bit wide right now. We sort of looked at each other over the last 2 or 3 days saying we should widen it, but we didn't think it was necessary. Our best guess is that the number will be probably over 12 and little bit under 15. So we're probably -- if I had to give you a bullet number now, that would be 13, someone? Give me the number?","Joseph Macnow","13.4?","Stephen W. Theriot","13.4, very precise 13.4. So Joe says 13.4. Steve, you have a number too. So if we have to guess at number right now it will be 13.4. It has been our policy, as a result of the magnitude of the BRAC ding to our numbers to guide with respect to our expectations of that; and my guess is, that we will continue to guide until we get very close to the resolution of this. We think it's something -- we think it's the transparent way to handle it. We think it's something that will benefit our shareholders. But what I'm saying is, we will continue to guide on that -- on the BRAC affect on our EBITDA. Now the second part of your question is, will the next sequestration and deadline, how will that affect the market do you think?","Mitchell N. Schear","I think, my view is, we've really taken the punches at this point. And I don't think there really are any more surprises and I think people -- as they've now come to expect the kind of situation to exist and we'll operate and we'll work through sequestration. There is a tremendously powerful marketplace. The service sector is fully functioning and the technology sector is growing. So I think we may not see the same kind of traditional tenancy of government and some specific government contractors. You may see a little more diversity in that. But at the end of the day, I think, the government will in fact still be a player, I think the contractors will be a player. They always figure out how to help the government, they're expert at doing that. So again, I think that we'll continue to push through, whatever really comes upon us at this point.","Stephen W. Theriot","Michael, I'll give you my take on that, if I might. First of all, another round of sequestration, another round of debt limit confrontation, can't be good. So if you had to make a directional bet, if it's going to help us and the world and economy or not, you have to take the not side of it, so that's pretty simple. Is the market conditioned to all of this theater in Washington? I think, pretty clearly, yes. I think it's an amazing thing that they took the last debt prices down to the evening before, and the markets and the stock market they said it just didn't have a single -- not a reaction at all. The markets were 100% certain that it would be resolved, so I leave that as a fact as to what it is. I think Mitchell made a very strong point, and these are absolutely facts, that Washington is -- government is an extremely strong economy with very low unemployment, very, very educated labor force, work force et cetera. So we have a great deal of confidence as a company and we think economists in the region share that view, that the private sector in Washington is thriving. The other side of that is, is we note in our numbers, that the private sector portion of our leasing is increasing, to the point that is now well over 50%. So our business initiative is to, obviously, we want every customer we can get. But obviously we are trolling for private sector tenants and hopeful.","Mitchell N. Schear","I think, I would just say that out of those $1 million plus square feet in the third quarter, half of it was..","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Half of it was what, Mitchell?","Stephen W. Theriot","Half of it was private sector.","Operator","Jamie Feldman from Bank of America is online with question.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm hoping you can talk a little bit about your largest expirations in 2014, what you're thinking in terms of renewals or potential vacancy and also, mark-to-market?","Stephen W. Theriot","That's above my pay grade, Jamie, so I'll give it over to the finance team or David and Mitchell or all of the above.","Michael D. Fascitelli","In New York some of the major expirations that we're looking at in '14 we've actually already talked about. So it's Morrison & Foerster, which we talked about at 1290 and Citibank at 666. We have planned for those expirations. We've repositioned these buildings. And as I said earlier, we've got very good action as it relates to the spaces that are coming up. So as I look out over the next 12 months, kind of feel very good about where we are and where I think our occupancy is going to be as we look out over the next 15, 18 months. In terms of mark-to-markets, I think, realistically, as we look at what we've been achieving, which is year-to-date Joe, the numbers are in the 7% to 8% range plus minus. I think realistically, it's all going to depend upon the particular pieces of space of course that we lease. But as I look at kind of, across our portfolio, in terms of where market rents are and where our escalated rents are, again, I think, what we've been achieving is generally reflective of where I see the mark-to-markets.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So, let me jump in on DC. I wouldn't really make any prediction with respect to the mark-to-markets at this point. As David said, it's always depending on a particular piece of space that's coming back and what the new deal is juxtaposed with that. In terms of overall expirations, we don't have a particularly heavy year for us. We do have a few remaining BRAC leases coming back to us that we know will in fact be vacant. But as far as the non-BRAC related space for 2014, I think that we view it as a reasonably manageable year.","Unknown Executive","I would add just one thing, to what Mitchell said. The first is, actually 2 things. The first is that, the Washington leasing this quarter was basically flat market-to-market. I think, the cash was up a pinch and the GAAP was down a pinch, but basically, flat. I think, that is a very, very, very satisfactory result in Washington in a very soft market. So I can tell you that I am very pleased with a flat, basically flat mark-to-market in Washington. The second thing is, and this relates to our New York business and our Washington business, one of our strategies has been, in acquisitions and in the management of our business, to avoid buildings that had 700,000, 800,000, million foot huge mega tenants. And so if you look at the profile of our tenancy, it is valued at -- 300,000 foot tenants is not small by any measure. But a 300,000 foot move out you can handle, Okay? A million foot move out you can't. So one of the things that we have done as a company, as a strategy, is to be very careful to have diversification in the size of our tenants and the industries to which we cater. And I think, we have a history of being -- having the highest occupancy rate of anybody in New York, and I think that is partly, that is the result of that strategy.","Stephen W. Theriot","I'd just add one other comment, which is, what we talked about earlier on the call, and that is as it relates to the retail portfolio. We do have some expiries coming up at 608 5th Avenue and 640 5th Avenue, we've talked about some of these in the past. And I think, we're going to see some extraordinary mark-to-markets, as it relates to the turnover of some of these great, great retail spaces.","Unknown Executive","Good point.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, I was actually going to ask about the retail also. When you look across the entire portfolio, I assume you're talking about 2014 but just across the entire portfolio, what do you think the mark-to-market is for the New York Street retail?","Unknown Executive","I don't want to the speculate on that. We'll get back to you. We don't have that number. Jamie, we don't have that number handy and I don't want to guess.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just finally, what are your thoughts on New York City rent growth? I guess, effective rent growth? And what it's been and what do you think is going to happen here?","David R. Greenbaum","We've been constructive on the market, Jamie. We've seen some good absorption. We've seen as I said earlier availability rates come down. The reality is, we are still in a tenant market. I think it's going to take us a couple of 100 basis points of absorption for us really to get to a landlords' market. So I don't think we're going to see any rents that are dramatically spiking, but as it relates to rent growth, we have continued to see the ability on a net effective basis as it relates to both space rents, pre-rent and work allowances, to see some good growth, which I think, as you kind of look around the marketplace, it's been on the kind of, 5-ish 6%, 7% range in Midtown and certainly, higher in Midtown South.","Stephen W. Theriot","The point that David makes about Midtown South is extremely interesting. The New York market is broken down into multiple submarkets. The interesting thing that has happened is, is there used to be a very, very delineated hierarchy of the submarkets where the Plaza District was the highest and then the Park Avenue District and then going down -- there was a hierarchal chain. That has basically -- what's the word, leveled. And so the city, in terms of office leasing, the rents had leveled, and the city is basically has a slight tilt to the south. Now maybe not all the way south, but clearly, the Midtown South, the Chelsea Market, the Penn Plaza District et cetera are benefiting enormously and are very tight. So we may see increases in rents which are not historically -- which we've never seen historically in some of those submarkets, at the expense of the traditional financial service industry locations. It's all very interesting what's happened. And actually, kind of exciting.","Operator","We have Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley on the line with the question.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A kind of rhetorical question, but on the joint purchase of 615 Mad, could you comment on the relative appeal of the retail versus the office component, just given that you're not buying much in office? In your mind is retail, what primarily got you excited, or could the deal have happened on the merits of the office space alone?","Stephen W. Theriot","Like I think from our perspective, a couple of things. We love the site. It's in a outstanding location on Madison, a full block front. And you have 200 feet of retail there frontage. And so I think, that was the most compelling dynamic, this site overall. And then the retail, the retail rolls over in 5 years to 7 years entirely and so we saw an opportunity to capture that uplift. And particularly, as retail, Madison has lagged rent wise and so we saw an opportunity for huge uptick there. The office, there's vacancy there that can be leased up, and again as David commented, that high-value boutique space is starting to move at a faster rate. And so that was attractive. But I think, absent retail, would it have been attractive? It's a theoretical question but it would have certainly been much less attractive. We obviously, if you look at everything we've done, retail has been the predominant focus and the retail made up a meaningful chunk of the value. I'm not going to break it out specifically, but it was a big chunk of value, and ultimately it sits on a great site, which theoretically could be redeveloped one day.","Michael Burke - Argus Research Company","Okay, that's helpful. And on the acquisition front, granted, you'll be disciplined. But could you give us some feel for the size of the active pipeline that you might move forward with and how this compares to levels over the past year? Is this really the smallest it's been because of the valuations or are you still pretty busy on that front?","Unknown Executive","I'll handle that. As we say every year in the letter that I write to our shareholders, we have no budget for acquisitions and acquisitions have a tendency to be chunky, based upon what's available in the marketplace, what the pricing is et cetera. So we really don't keep a list -- a comparative list of a pipeline so to speak. We are always in the market. We are always looking at everything that's in the market. We see every deal in the market, either first, second or third; and so, even though, we are not -- we may not be buying at a particular time, or we may not like the pricing of the particular asset, we go through every single important asset that comes on the market. So we're always busy, although part of the rigor and the discipline is when to say yes and when to say no.","Operator","We have John Guinee from Stifel online with a question.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Decided not to list into Lexington, 1 follow up question, Steve,. Basically everything you said -- acquisition market tough, net sellers, not getting any credit for your square foot of vacancy, $3 billion of liquidity, you're probably trading by a lot of people's numbers at a 6 in buy Cap -- all that would sort of head towards some sort of share buyback. Is that -- do you have a share buyback out there?","Stephen W. Theriot","No, we don't.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Any thoughts on it?","Stephen W. Theriot","Well, I long for the old days, we just did some history. And in the 1980s, we bought back 50% of the stock of Vornado. And -- but we were buying that stock back at 40% and 50% of what we thought its values was. I think that buybacks are very tricky. We talked about them at, not every board meeting, but we talk about them at least once a year, maybe even more frequently. And it's not something that I, that we have, we don't have a buyback authorization outstanding. And it's not something that we think is an extraordinary -- it's not something that we have in the forefront of our minds right now.","Operator","We have Steve Sakwa on the line from ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to clarify, on that $70 million you're talking about of lost earnings. Are you assuming that DC portfolio kind of gets up to say 93%, and assuming kind of a basic $40 rent? Is that kind of your math?","Stephen W. Theriot","The math would be getting up to historic occupancies in the low '90s, maybe even -- 93 is a decent guess at about what we think the market rents are yes. By the way it could be little bit more than that, too. But it's a big hole that we intend to fill.","Unknown Executive","That was a short enough question and we're going to take one last.","Unknown Executive","One more question, operator. Last question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Actually, I had 2 follow-ups, hopefully I can ask them. 220 Central Park South not clearly resolving the conflict with Barnett, and being able to sort of get the air rights and move forward; and Steve, you talked about having $500 million in today, thinking it's worth $1 billion, just as it is. How do you think about putting incremental capital into residential to be able to get at that gain versus selling off today and maybe it's not as big of a gain at the end of the day. But it goes along the path of simplification, pruning and focus? And just how you think about Vornado's exposure to a project of that size, which obviously has a little bit longer of a tail to its ultimate resolution, if you were to move forward alone?","Stephen W. Theriot","Well, first of all, we couldn't be more delighted to be the proud parents of that site. It is by consensus the best site in town. It took 8 years to get it to this condition, the 8 years were clearly worth it. I would like to take credit for it, but I can't. Basically the market has risen to the point where the delay was enormously to our benefit. And we think the site is worth well more than $1 billion, as a raw site. We own the site free and clear. So we've got an enormous amount of financial flexibility. And we have lots of options all the way from selling the site, and we get calls on it weekly, all the way to building it ourselves, all the way to doing a hybrid which is inviting a financial partner in to share the bounty. All of those are on the table. As we, and this is the important thing, as we move forward in the development process without any hesitation to build the job. And so, the interesting thing about it is, because we have to do that, we may -- while we may take in a financial partner or do any other extraordinary kind of financial transaction, we will move forward as if in the process of building the job. The equity that we have in this property is so significant that we can build the job with nonrecourse debt without putting any capital whatsoever in it. I think, what I said was, we're delighted with the site. We have an extraordinary profit in it. I'd like to take credit for it, but I shan't. And we have lots of financial options, all of which we will investigate as you would expect.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then can you just comment on Mart and the Strip site? I assume neither of those were included in that call at $1.5 billion or $2 billion of those assets on the market and on deck. Just, how those sort of play into your simplify-prune focus?","Stephen W. Theriot","The answer to that is, the Mart building, which we have said over the last period of time, is a keeper. We think we have extraordinary value creation in front of us there. We think that the Motorola- Google deal is transformative. And we think that building is now the bull's-eye in the today tech kind of tenancies. So we have a lot to do out there and we're quite excited about that actually. With respect to this, the other shopping centers, clearly, the list of dispositions includes some assets that are retail. Certainly, nothing in Manhattan, but, there we do have some outlying non-core geographically and even non-core from the quality point of view, retail assets that are on the disposition list.","Operator","Operator, thank you.

One Park Avenue was a 20-story, 941,000-square-foot office building located on the full eastern block front of Park Avenue between 32nd and 33rd Streets in Midtown South, the hottest submarket in the town. The history here is that we acquired 46.5% in 2011 when our real estate fund acquired a 64.7% interest, and we co-invested with the fund for a direct 30.3% interest.","In connection with that initial acquisition, we negotiated a new long-term lease with NYU Langone Medical Center, the building's major tenant, expanding its base from 180,000 square feet to 370,000 square feet. Today, NYU Langone occupies 458,000 square feet. Vornado's IRR from this investment was 25.0% during the fund's holding period. Our new investment here was made at a basis of $595 per square foot.","Recently, we entered into an agreement to acquire the retail condominium of the St. Regis Hotel and the adjacent retail townhouse. The property has 100 feet of frontage on Fifth Avenue on the Southeast corner of 55th Street in the heart of the area of Fifth Avenue, favored by the world's luxury retailers. We also own 689 Fifth Avenue on the same block. The St. Regis property is bookended to the south by the brand-new Valentino flagship, which opened days ago, and it's a wow, and to the north by the new 40,000-square-foot Polo flagship, which will open the end of this month.","This property has a 17,100-square-foot lease with the Gucci division of Kering for its Bottega Veneta brand through January 2016 and a 7,600-square-foot lease with LVMH for its DeBeers brand through January 2019.","The purchase price for the property is approximately $700 million, and our GAAP yield is estimated at over 4%. We will own between 67% and 80%, and our partner, Crown Acquisitions, will own the balance. The final ownership percentages will be based on the amount of debt financing put on the property and Crown's short-term option to invest additional capital. The purchase is expected to close by early fourth quarter of this year, subject to customary closing conditions.","Also in July, we made 3 other investments. First, the joint venture in which we are a 50% partner entered into a 99-year ground lease for 61 Ninth Avenue on the Southwest corner of Ninth Avenue and 15th Street in the heart of the Meatpacking District adjacent to the Apple Store and Chelsea Market and across from 111 Eighth Avenue, Google's 3 million-square-foot New York headquarters building. This will be a ground up new build. The venture plans are to construct an office and retail building of approximately 130,000 square feet. Total development costs are estimated to be approximately $125 million.","Second, we acquired the land under our 715 Lexington Avenue retail property for $63 million.","And third, we acquired a small retail property on Canal Street for $16.4 million.","There has been a lot of hubbub lately about Manhattan Street Retail. This asset class is now drawing a lot of attention, and some of our industry brethren are now jumping on the bandwagon that we have been on for the last 15 years. This asset class has been and continues to be the best performing of all retail asset classes, benefiting from increases in tenant sales, rapidly rising rents, rabid investor interest and, most importantly, extremely limited supply, read extreme scarcity.","Our largest and best-in-class Manhattan Street Retail portfolio consists of 2.8 million square feet in 63 properties, with EBITDA of over $310 million per year and growing. To demonstrate the uniqueness of this asset class, Green Street uses a 3.6% cap rate to value our Manhattan Street Retail assets, which is 100 basis points lower than the rate they use to value the best mall portfolio and 80 basis points lower than the rate they use to value the best office portfolio in Midtown Manhattan. In the private market, Manhattan Street Retail assets, depending on exact location and specifics of lease encumbrances, can even trade at sub-3% cap rates. By the way, Green Street has Vornado's NAV at $116 and $0.25 per share.","Now to dispositions. In July, we completed the sale of Beverly Connection for $260 million. In addition, our fund and its 50% partner agreed to sell the 313,000-square-foot shops at Georgetown Park for $272.5 million. This large multi-level failed in-town mall in the heart of Georgetown was totally transformed by our development and leasing teams. The IRR on Vornado's share of this investment is 45%. Further, we are selling 2 small retail assets for $15.1 million.","Excluding the Springfield Town Center, which will be transferred to PREIT for $465 million, we currently have about $900 million on the for sale list. This includes 20 non-Manhattan retailer assets that are not going into SpinCo and 1740 Broadway, a stabilized, unencumbered office building, which will be -- the proceeds of which will be recycled into other assets through 1031 exchanges.","As CFO, Steve Theriot, will tell you in a moment, we have $4.1 billion in liquidity, comprised of $1.7 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, and $2.4 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities.","Our pipeline of internal value-creating opportunities is robust, including our supertall 220 Central Park South residential condominium tower, which is now well along in excavation of foundations; our massive retail and signage transformation at the Marriott Marquis in the bull's eye of the Times Square bow-tie, across the street from our 1540 Broadway full block retail and signage; our 1.1 million square feet of redevelopments at 330 West 34th Street and 7 West 34th market, which are targeted to the creative class market; the transformation of the 1.2 million-square-foot 280 Park Avenue; the 44,000-square-foot Topshop 4-level flagship at 608 Fifth Avenue at 49th Street; our 699-unit residential project in Pentagon City, with Whole Foods at the base; the 1.4 million-square-foot Springfield Mall total redevelopment, which is on schedule for a holiday -- actually, October 17 opening this year; the redevelopment of Wayne Towne Center in Wayne, New Jersey. And all this is in addition to our plans in the Penn Plaza District.","Now to leasing. Company-wide in the quarter, we leased 2,130,000 square feet and 154 transactions, with positive mark-to-markets of 6.7% cash and 14.2% GAAP. We leased 1,222,000 square feet in New York alone, 2.2 million square feet in New York year-to-date. We continue to be very constructive on the New York Office market, submarket by submarket. As I have said before, the island of Manhattan is tilting slightly to the south and to the west, greatly inuring to the benefit of the Penn Plaza District, where we are the dominant owner with over 9 million square feet of office and retail and the Hotel Pennsylvania. Our New York business continues to put up very strong industry-leading metrics.","Our Washington business, where we have recently seen a slight uptick in activity, continues to bounce along the bottom. We will be competitive and aggressive here to retain tenants and fill vacant space. As I have said before, we believe there is no value in our share price for the vacancy in Washington. As such, we anticipate very significant value creation as we lease up the space.","To sum up, I am very pleased with both our operating performance and our progress on simplification and focusing the business.","Now I will turn it over to Steve Theriot to cover more details of our financial results.","Stephen W. Theriot","Thank you, Steve. Yesterday, we reported second quarter comparable FFO of $1.44 per share, up from $1.27 in the prior year second quarter, a 13.4% increase. Second quarter comparable EBITDA was $450 million.","Our New York business produced $251.3 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, ahead of last year second quarter by 7.8%, primarily driven by a very strong same-store increase of 5.2% and property acquisitions.","Our Washington business produced $84.9 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter, essentially flat to last year. As we dimensioned on the last quarter's call, we expect Washington's 2014 comparable EBITDA to be approximately $10 million to $15 million lower than 2013. More than offsetting the expected decline in comparable EBITDA, we expect to realize a reduction in interest expense of $16 million in 2014, in addition to the $3 million realized in 2013 from the restructuring of the Skyline mortgage loan. Net-net, we expect our Washington segment's contribution to comparable FFO to be $1 million to $6 million ahead of last year.","Our retail strips and malls business produced $50 million of comparable EBITDA for the quarter and generated a same-store EBITDA increase of 1.8% GAAP and 3.1% on a cash basis over last year's second quarter. We leased 231,000 square feet at the strip centers, with a positive mark-to-market of 14% GAAP and 8.9% cash. We leased 54% -- or 54,000 square feet at the malls, with a positive mark-to-market of 5.6% on both a GAAP and cash basis.","Occupancy for the strip centers was 93.7% at quarter end, down 20 basis points on a sequential basis from the first quarter. Occupancy for the malls was 95.4%, down 30 basis points from the first quarter.","Total second quarter FFO was $1.15 per share as compared to $1.25 per share in the prior year second quarter. Noncomparable items this quarter were a negative $55 million or $0.29 per share of loss compared to negative $4 million or $0.02 per share of loss for the second quarter of last year.","This year's second quarter noncomparable items included negative FFO from Toys of $51.9 million, $5.6 million of definitive costs in connection with the refinancing of 909 Third Avenue -- I'm sorry, $4.1 million of acquisition and transition costs, partially offset by $2.2 million of FFO from discontinued operations. The carrying amount of our investment in Toys is down to $26 million at quarter end.","Please see our press release for an -- or the overview and MD&A on Page 36 of our Form 10-Q for a complete summary of noncomparable items.","Again, this quarter, let me take a moment to explain the change in our total revenues line. While it looks like total revenues decreased for the 6 months ended June 30, on a comparable basis, total revenues increased $50.5 million or 4% over the prior year when adjusted to exclude last year's onetime $59.6 million from the Stop & Shop litigation; $24.5 million from Independence Plaza, which was de-consolidated in last year's second quarter; and fees of $29.1 million from the Cleveland Medical Mart development project, which we sold. Our second quarter revenues were also up 4% after adjusting for Independence Plaza and the Cleveland Medical Mart.","Now turning to capital markets. As Steve mentioned, we have $4.1 billion in liquidity, comprised of $1.7 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, and $2.4 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion of revolving credit facilities. We will utilize some of our cash to repay debt. We intend to repay in October the $445 million of outstanding 7 7\/8% senior unsecured notes due 2039. We also intend to repay our $500 million of 4 1\/4% unsecured notes due April 2015, when they first become freely prepayable in January 2015. These 2 repayments alone will generate incremental FFO of $0.28 per share per year.","In April, we completed a $350 million refinancing of 909 Third Avenue. This interest-only loan is at 3.91% fixed and matures in May 2021. We realized net proceeds of $145 million after repaying the existing 4.65%, a $193 million mortgage defeasance and closing costs. We also completed a $300 million refinancing of the office portion of 731 Lexington Avenue owned by Alexander's, our 32.4% affiliate. The interest-only loan is at LIBOR plus 95 basis points, currently 1.1%, and has a final maturity in March 2021. The proceeds of the new loan will be used to repay the existing $312 million, 5.33% fixed rate loan.","In June, we completed a green bond offering of $450 million of 2.5% senior unsecured notes due June 30, 2019. The notes were priced at a 90-basis-point spread over the benchmark treasury.","Finally, in July, we completed $130 million refinancing of the Las Catalinas Mall in Puerto Rico. The 10-year fixed rate loan bears interest at 4.43% and amortizes based on a 30-year schedule beginning in year 6.","Our consolidated debt-to-enterprise value is 34.4%, and our consolidated debt-to-EBITDA is 7.1x. Our debt mix is balanced with fixed rate debt accounting for 87% of the total, with the weighted average rate of 4.56% and a weighted average term of 6.5 years; and floating rate debt accounting for 13% of the total, with the current weighted average interest rate of 2.25% and a weighted average term of 4.1 years.","We have no remaining 2014 maturities. And after giving effect to the repayment of our 4 1\/4% senior unsecured notes in January, our 2015 maturities totaled just $245.8 million.","And with that, I'll turn it over to David Greenbaum to cover our New York business.","David R. Greenbaum","Steve, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Before I return to our results for the quarter, as usual, I'm going to spend a minute just talking about the market.","At a macro level, we seem to be witnessing an inflection point in the business climate. With growing confidence, businesses have begun to shift their focus from the cost-cutting mindset of the last several years to a renewed focus on growing top line numbers. In past cycles, when we've seen that shift occurring, the pace of job growth has accelerated.","New York City office sector employment, currently expanding at about 2% per annum, has now reached 1,276,000 jobs, which is just 20,000 jobs shy of the all-time peak reached in 2001. Anecdotally, in our own portfolio, real office job growth has been evident with our statistics. Over the last 2 years, consistently, 20-plus percent of the space we have leased each quarter has been with tenants new to the New York market or existing tenants expanding their footprint in New York City. This job growth has largely been achieved without the benefit of the traditional drivers of growth, financial services and law firms. Tech, creative and professional services, in particular, have fueled much of the growth in the office using employment, which highlights the continued diversification of New York's economy.","Consistent with our investment thesis, and as we have discussed again and again, a key secular trend we are continuing to see is an accelerating dominance of the great urban centers in the country, New York, Washington, San Francisco, Chicago. Tenants aggressively are gravitating to the urban cores in order to recruit and retain the best and the brightest of the millennial generation, which values the 24\/7 live, work, play environment of these great cities. A recent job statistic highlights this point. Over the past decade, since 2004, of the 550,000 jobs that have been created in the New York metropolitan area, substantially all 515,000 were in New York City, with only 35,000 jobs created in the suburbs.","Manhattan leasing velocity has continued to accelerate with a total of 17.8 million square feet leased year-to-date. Net absorption of 2.5 million square feet has pushed the Manhattan vacancy rate down to about 10.7%, while overall asking rents over the past 12 months have continued to rise modestly. In a meeting last week with one of the most senior brokerage teams in New York, their take on the market was that we are just at the beginning of a period of significant rent growth.","Let me now turn to Vornado's performance for the quarter. We topped our first quarter activity with another exceptionally productive quarter, 1,222,000 square feet of office leasing activity in the second quarter in 46 transactions, with an average lease term of 11.6 years. Total leasing for the first half of 2014 is some 2.2 million square feet, virtually all of our activities for last year. In the first 6 months of the year, we completed 25%, 10 of the top 40 largest leasing transactions in Manhattan as reported by Crain's. Of the 1.2 million square feet we leased this quarter, 58% of our activity was with tenants new to our portfolio and existing tenants expanding. The balance, 42%, was renewal. The activity was well-balanced throughout the portfolio, not concentrated in any 1 submarket. Our average starting rent was a healthy $69.43, with very strong positive mark-to-markets of 19.1% GAAP and 10.4% cash. Second quarter occupancy was 97.3%, up 40 basis points from the first quarter. We are full.","There are several highlights in our second quarter leasing activity. The largest lease of the quarter was a 355,000-square-foot lease with Neuberger Berman at 1290 Avenue of the Americas that we announced on the last call. Neuberger Berman leased entire floors 22 to 29 and 38 to 43 for 22 years, taking the space currently occupied by Morrison & Foerster, as well as the space leased to Warner Music.","At 1290, we also completed a 58,000-square-foot lease expansion with AXA. As you may remember, last year, AXA subleased some 300,000 square feet of the 400,000 square feet they leased at 1290. Consistent with the macro trend I discussed earlier of companies shifting their focus to top line growth, AXA now recognizing that its New York business is in a growth mode came back to us and leased 58,000 square feet.","At 90 Park Avenue, on the last call, I announced the start of a building capital program, including new mechanical systems, state-of-the-art elevators and a total lobby transformation. In the second quarter, we completed an 80,000 -- 83,000-square-foot renewal and expansion with the law firm Foley & Lardner. Combined with 102,000-square-foot lease with FactSet Systems in the first quarter and a couple of smaller deals, we have now leased nearly 40% of the 450,000 square feet of leases scheduled to expire over the next 2 years at substantially higher rents.","In Midtown South, at our 1.1 million-square-foot 770 Broadway located between 8th and 9th Streets, J.Crew once again expanded, taking 80,000 square feet the entire 15th floor and now leases 455,000 square feet in this cutting-edge creative hub. Facebook also expanded for the second time this year, adding 39,000 square feet on the second floor and now leases a total of 196,000 square feet. Tenants really appreciate the bones of this well-located building in Midtown South, with great light and air, high ceilings, large footplates -- floor plates and state-of-the-art infrastructure.","Let me turn now to Penn Plaza. Speaking at a recent conference, one of the city's leading brokers echoed Steve Roth's sentiment on the market saying, and I quote, \"The epicenter of Manhattan is moving West, South and even Downtown, with TAMI tenants driving the shift in demand.\" We completed a large deal in Penn Plaza this quarter with our friends at Madison Square Garden. MSG renewed its 312,000 square feet of leases at Two Penn Plaza and Eleven Penn Plaza across the street, committing to these properties through 2024.","At our 735,000-square-foot 330 West 34th Street redevelopment, just last week, and not included in the Q2 numbers, we signed 2 important leases for a total of 158,000 square feet, 1 with Deutsche advertising coming out of 111 Eighth Avenue, the Google building for the entire 13th and 14th floors at 330 West, and the other with Yodle, an online marketing company, for the entire 16th, 17th and 18th floors. Activity at 330 West 34th Street and 7 West 34th Street is really good, and we're excited by the market's reaction to our building transformation programs.","Our Penn Plaza portfolio continues to be full, with our occupancy at 97.2%.","At 280 Park Avenue, our joint venture with SL Green, we expect to deliver the mid-block jewel box atrium in October, complementing the full block Park Avenue lobby. Just last week, again, not included in the Q2 numbers, we completed a 39,000-square-foot new lease with Taconic Capital Advisors and also shook hands on a 30,000-square-foot expansion with one of our existing full floor 50,000-square-foot tenants.","Over the past year, we aggressively have been working on future office lease expirations. Expirations for the remainder of 2014 are quite modest, with only 308,000 square feet expiring. For 2015, we are now down to approximately 1 million square feet of expiring space, having already leased 1.2 million square feet of the 2015 expirations.","In our Manhattan Street Retail portfolio, we completed 6 retail leases in the quarter, totaling 20,000 -- 23,000 square feet, with mark-to-markets of 57.2% GAAP and 30.4% cash. As I mentioned on the last call, the long-term lease renewal with Coach at 595 Madison Avenue, The Fuller Building, on the corner of 57th Street. This quarter, we also delivered possession to Topshop-Topman at 608 Fifth Avenue for its 44,000-square-foot, 4-level flagship. Topshop is now completing its interior fit-out for the fall opening, which Steve mentioned.","In San Francisco, we continued the strong activity at our 1.8 million-square-foot 555 California Street. This massive granite building dominates the skyline, and it's the best office building in San Francisco. In the second quarter, we signed 3 leases totaling 88,000 square feet, the highlight of which was a 76,000-square-foot lease with Fenwick & West, a leading law firm that represents companies in the technology and life science sectors. And just last week, we signed a renewal expansion with Dodge & Cox for 112,000 square feet. Year-to-date, we have completed over 315,000 square feet of leasing at 555 California.","At the 3.5 million-square-foot Chicago Mart building located to the -- at the center of the hot River North market, we completed 111,000 square feet of leasing this quarter. We have rebranded this great iconic asset, the Mart, dropping merchandise from the name. Continuing the evolution of the Mart into a home for technology-based office tenants, in the quarter, we signed a 59,000-square-foot lease with Braintree, which was acquired last year by the PayPal division of eBay. And we are now in final lease drafts with 2 additional tech tenants for a total of 76,000 square feet. The Mart is a buzz of activity.","To conclude my remarks, let me summarize the entire New York division. We once again had a very strong quarter, our key performance metrics, industry-leading, with same-store EBITDA increases for the overall division of 6.9% cash and 5.2% GAAP. Isolating just the New York office business, our same-store EBITDA increased 7% cash and 5% GAAP.","Let me just conclude by noting that while our New York portfolio effectively is full, we look forward to the positive impact our redevelopment activities at 330 West 34th Street, 7 West 34th Street, 280 Park Avenue and the Marriott retail and signage block front at 1535 Broadway will have on our operations as all of this space is placed back into service in 2015 and '16.","Now I'll turn over the call to Mitchell Schear to cover Washington.","Mitchell N. Schear","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our second quarter results and encouraged by the uptick in activity that we're seeing and working. We are being competitive and aggressive to retain tenants and fill vacant space.","In the quarter, we completed 401,000 square feet of office and retail leases in 53 transactions. Including the first quarter, thus far, in 2014, we have signed leases for 766,000 square feet of office and retail space in 115 transactions. Overall, office leases signed in the second quarter generated a GAAP mark-to-market of negative 4.0% and a cash mark-to-market of negative 9%. We don't love these metrics, but it's what we expected in today's competitive leasing market in Washington.","Our total occupancy, including residential, was up slightly by 20 basis points from Q1 to 83.5%, which is weighed down by Skyline's 58.5% occupancy. Excluding Skyline, our overall occupancy increased by 20 basis points to 88.3%, and our office-only occupancy increased by 10 basis points to 85.8%.","Our residential business continues to be very strong with a 98% occupancy for Q2, a 120-basis-point improvement from Q1. We own more than 2,400 apartments in highly sought after urban locations, including Crystal City, Pentagon City, Rosslyn and Georgetown.","Quarter-over-quarter, we've reported flattish same-store EBITDA of negative 1.7% cash and negative 1.8% GAAP. As always, we are in the leasing business, and we're making headway on our BRAC vacancy. Since the close of Q1, we leased an additional 158,000 square feet of BRAC space. To date, we've resolved 1.3 million square feet or 63% of our BRAC space and in Crystal City alone, almost 1 million square feet or 71% of our BRAC impacted space.","At 201 12th Street in Crystal City, where we had one of our largest concentrations of BRAC, which is 221,000 square feet, we have executed leases for 80% of that space or 177,000 square feet. These include a lease signed in Q2 with L-3 Communications, a defense technology firm, for 30,500 square feet; also, a new lease with GSA signed in July for 25,000 square feet; and a lease signed just last week with a new GSA tenant coming to Crystal City, the Department of Labor, for 75,000 square feet.","We've also made progress at 251 18th Street, another BRAC-impacted building. We've recently made deals with 2 associations totaling 25,500 square feet, both new to Crystal City and coming from Downtown D.C. Our proximity to Capitol Hill and National Airport makes us an ideal location for associations and nonprofit organizations.","On our last call, I discussed 4 transformative moves to attract the growing demographic of creative and tech clusters to Crystal City. Each of these initiatives has generated a steady stream of interest, and they are increasing activity for us as we had hoped.","In July, we received approval from Arlington County for our new project with WeWork to build a residential building. We're on a fast path to a mid-2015 opening of 252 community-style units with an imaginative design and connected to dynamic shared social spaces. WeWork will bring the same sense of community and opportunities for collaboration to residential as their office concept.","The $50 million Crystal Tech fund is now home to 8 growth technology companies. Events and programs at the Crystal Tech space have attracted over 1,500 entrepreneurs and tech influencers.","TechShop has signed up nearly 600 members since their opening in April. With activity and classes held days, evenings and weekends, TechShop is a street activator and a magnet for entrepreneurs and creatives.","Our DesignLab attracted over 2,500 people and has generated significant interest from brokers, tenants and the media. The suites are leasing well, and plans for DesignLab 2 are underway, with 10 new suites ready later this year.","In summary, we are ticking along as we expected in 2014. We remain excited about our opportunities to create value by leasing up our vacancy and harvesting our vast development pipeline on the shores of Potomac. Thank you very much.","And I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Bilerman.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Steve, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about -- on street retail, you talked about the hubbub of activity and Vornado being in the business in the city for over 15 years. I'm curious sort of your view as you think about street retail and the scarcity of space in other key geographies, whether it be London in Bond and Regent Street, Ginza in Tokyo, Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris. How sort of would you approach or would you even approach taking what has been a success here for you to other markets?","Steven Roth","Michael, we've thought about that, and obviously, we have not invested anyplace other than our great street retail business in New York. In order to invest in other cities, there's a couple of things that we need. First of all, we would need troops on the ground. We would need local knowledge. We would -- these are very, very, very -- I don't want to say tricky. These are very sensitive markets. Every block is different. Every -- whether it's on one side of the street or the other side of the street, is different. So I don't think anybody dares invest in a foreign land. And by the way, Chicago is a little foreign if we don't have a major intellectual knowledge of the marketplaces. So we have thought about it and do 2 caveats for that. Number one, we would have to really be assured that we know these markets sufficiently, intimately to invest. And by that I mean not just relying solely, not just being dumb money with local partners. The second is, is there would have to be a good entry point, where there is some distress in the marketplace, where there is some -- I mean, it would not be a wise thing for our shareholders, for us to start going into foreign markets at what looks like they are very high prices.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, just on D.C. EBITDA. You talked about the...","Steven Roth","Michael, by the way, if there was a publicly traded real estate company, which had dominant holdings in 3 or 4 of these -- dominant retail holdings, very focused retail holdings in 3 or 4 of these great markets, it would be an extremely, extremely important and sought after investment.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I don't know if that -- if you're saying that in a way that there's something to come, but I'll just store that for future.","Steven Roth","No, I'm not trying to be provocative. What I'm just saying is, is that these are totally unique assets, and each of these 4 or 5 or 6 great cities share similar characteristics in terms of customer, in terms of tenants' desire to be there, in terms of the sophistication of the shopping customer, the amount of tourism, the wealth, et cetera. And so, I mean, don't read anything more into what I'm saying.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up, just on -- in terms of D.C. EBITDA. You talked about the slight uptick in activity. There's a sequential increase, albeit modest, in EBITDA. And I'm just curious how that ties to what seems to be a reiterated forecast of D.C. EBITDA being down $10 million to $15 million. You are only down $2 million year-to-date. It doesn't seem that the comps get too difficult in the back half of the year just given when the vacancy occurred. And it doesn't seem that the role is that bad in the back half. And so I just didn't know if there was something else that we're missing.","Steven Roth","I don't think there's anything else that you're missing. I mean, we're certainly not declaring victory. We are not changing our guidance. We are optimistic that we will do slightly better than our guidance, but we think it's going to be a little rougher in the second half than in the first half. So you are right to have identified that $2 million. We talked about it at great length over the last days. And we think we will likely do better than the low end of our guidance but not as much better as the $2 million we seem to indicate.","Operator","Our next question is from John Bejjani.","John Bejjani","Mitchell, a couple of D.C. questions. The 9% down cash re-leasing spread seems to be a step backward versus recent quarters. Is this an anomalous data point tied to a couple of leases? Or is the cost of business heading higher? And secondly, how does your leasing progress so far this year compared against your occupancy expectations at the start of the year?","Mitchell N. Schear","Sure. Thank you, John. So with respect to the mark-to-market numbers, I think you just have to look at each quarter and you have to look at the particular spaces that came back and the particular leases that got done. There happened to have been a couple of leases in the Crystal Gateways, where we've been aggressive in terms of leasing space, a couple of leases out in Reston. So I think that I wouldn't make anything broader than just the numbers that they've come across for the quarter. And in terms of our leasing projections, I think that we are consistent with what our expectations were at the beginning of the year. And I think in the first 2 quarters, they've been consistent with our expectations and expect the rest of the year to be the same as we've expected as well.","Steven Roth","John, let me add on to what Mitchell said. Basically, we have a fair amount of empty space in the Washington marketplace. Our competitors or brethren or whatever you want to call the rest of the marketplace also has empty space. We -- from a policy point of view, we will be competitive, okay? We will not let our competitors take away our tenants, and we will fight for each piece of business. So the fact that rents are going down a little bit, that's to be expected, it's planned and it's part of our business strategy of being aggressive.","John Bejjani","Great. Steve, I guess, can you update us on the status of the 640 Fifth release. I think last quarter, you suggested this mother of all rollovers is ready to give birth.","Steven Roth","Well, the answer is bad things happen every once in a while. We had worked on a deal, a single tenant deal for 640 Fifth Avenue, which is a large tenant -- larger than 40,000 square feet. We've worked on it for well over a year. We were in the final stages of completing the deal, and the deal disappeared. So that happens every once in a while. And we are now in the process of working on multiple tenants for that space. We are moving along. We're in the process. We have nothing to say now about it. We expect to be -- we expect we are -- we don't expect, we are certain that the economics of dividing the space will be the same as the economics that would have been achieved with a single larger user, albeit it's going to take a little more time because we were waylaid, we were -- how do I say it? We were jilted, okay? So there you have it. But nonetheless, the mother of all, in terms of the economics, will be the same, albeit we'll have to wait a little bit longer for it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Steve, as you think about allocating capital into street retail versus the other businesses, do you have a lower return hurdle that you think might need to be achieved in order to allocate capital? Or do you think about IRRs in the street retail at the same way you think about office?","Steven Roth","Steve, make no mistake about it. We invest in street retail for 2 main reasons, one is to make money and the second one is to make money. So I've read some comments that somebody said, some of these street retail deals are small. Well, the answer to that is a 5,000-square-foot space on Fifth Avenue is probably equivalent to 400,000 square feet of office space on Fifth Avenue. So the math -- the numbers in terms of square footage may be small, but the numbers in terms of income and the numbers in terms of the capital values of that income are equivalent to large office buildings. So the answer is we really, when we invest, we really look at the potential value of an asset over a 5-year and maybe even a 7-year and maybe even a 10-year hold. And we invest in -- we try to underwrite what will happen to the value of that asset in the income stream over a fairly decent period of time, not 1 quarter or 2 quarters. And we have found, if you go through the experience of our portfolio that over time, we have made a lot of -- an enormous amount of money on our offices investments. We have made even more money on our retail investments. So the answer is we don't have any favorite child. We're in it for the money. We're in it for the capital appreciation. And that's the way we allocate capital.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Maybe a question for David. As you kind of look at the back half of '14, and the, I guess, the minimal rolls that you have now coming up at about a million feet, what do you think the lease spreads might be kind of over the next 18 months on the space to roll over?","David R. Greenbaum","As Mitchell has said, it's obviously all dependent upon the space that comes up. But I think, consistently, as we've seen over the last couple of years, our lease spreads for both a cash and a GAAP have been in the -- running around the high-single digits to low-double digits to, in some cases, even high-double digits, as they were this quarter. So I think as we're looking at our lease rolls over the next year or so with a market that I feel pretty good about, we think those numbers should be achievable over the next period of time.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess you don't see them necessarily accelerating given the fact you're 97% occupied?","David R. Greenbaum","When you say accelerating, the mark-to-market at any piece of space is not going to accelerate, obviously. I think where we're going to see some significant growth in the portfolio over the next couple of years, as we -- as I mentioned in my remarks, as we bring properties that are currently out of service, 7 West, 330 West, 280, 1535, that's going to have a material impact on my business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First question is on a number of these transactions that you guys have done, especially on the street retail, the new transactions, you've entered in with JVs, whether it's you have a St. Regis or in the Meatpacking District. Just sort of curious, is this trying to maximizing the capital as far as earning management fees or promotes? Or is this because there's such intense competition that you just say, hey, let's partner up, rather than killing ourselves over just bidding up deals to crazy prices? Because certainly, you guys have the capital wherewithal to pull off these deals. So curious, a number of these that have JVs with them?","Steven Roth","Alexander, each one is different. We -- let's take the 2 specific examples that you mentioned. The St. Regis deal, we partnered -- our partner had control over the deal. So it was not a -- we didn't partner for capital. We have, obviously, more capital than our partner does in this particular -- so he had control over the deal. So he brought the deal to us to -- and that's why he's in the deal. And he provided a great service. And so that's that. In the Ninth Avenue deal in the Meatpacking, we partnered with another investor, who will be the developer of the property for lots of different reasons, who brings along some adjacent air rights as well. So those are -- both of those 2 specifics, neither one of them were capital-based. They were both strategy-based and sourcing-based.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then the second question is, in the conversation about foreign lands, just something a little bit closer and across an old time bridge, your thoughts on Brooklyn. Is that an area that we should think about you guys expanding into or are your views of that market -- or is your view that there's enough opportunity in Manhattan that you don't need to cross the river?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is all of the above. There is certainly enough opportunity in Manhattan to keep us and our capital busy. We believe the returns in Manhattan are greater than they are almost anywhere else in the world. Brooklyn is certainly attractive. We have looked at a few things in Brooklyn. We may well invest in Brooklyn. I think that most of the easy money in Brooklyn has been achieved already because values have already risen very significantly. But Brooklyn is the real McCoy, and we have no current things to announce or plans in Brooklyn, but it wouldn't surprise, I don't think anybody, if we made a -- if we invested here, if we allocated some capital to Brooklyn.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","As you guys are talking about the center of gravity in Manhattan shifting to the south and to the west, I was hoping to get your thoughts on midtown longer-term? What do you guys think happens in the market as we do start to see some of these large leases move downtown or to the Hudson Yards? And should we read into your sale of 1740 Broadway as a longer-term view on the market?","David R. Greenbaum","Jamie, it's David. I think -- listen, my view is midtown is not going away. We've had some very good activity in Midtown. And there obviously are some big blocks of space that are currently on the market in midtown, and there are a couple of big blocks that are going to come on this space in midtown, the Conde space, the Time Inc. space. But I will tell you, for well-located buildings in midtown that still are at transportation, and most importantly, for buildings that have been maintained to state-of-the-art standards, similar to what we recently achieved at 1290 Sixth Avenue, we continue to see some very good activity from tenants in midtown. And long-term, I think, Sixth Avenue, Park Avenue, Fifth Avenue are going to be just fine. We obviously are seeing, though, as you mentioned, the branching out of the island, which seems to be a long-term secular trend.","Steven Roth","So let me add on to what David said. I've said frequently and quite publicly that the island of Manhattan seems to be tilting to the south and to the west. I do not believe that, that is a short-term cyclical trend. I think it is a secular trend. I think that we are finding that tenants are actually surprisingly willing to go to places on Manhattan Island that they would not have thought about 15 years ago. That is motivated by multiple things. It's motivated by the fact that price is cheaper when you get out of the very tight midtown plaza district submarkets. And it's also motivated by the fact that their employees want to work in different kinds of environments, depending upon whether it's a banking firm with -- where everybody wears a formal attire, whether it's a creative firm. A comment about pricing is it has been, I think, surprising to everybody, and I've said this also formerly, that pricing seems to have leveled out. The hierarchy of submarkets in Manhattan is leveling. So it used to be that the plaza district got the highest rents in town by far, then Park Avenue, then Sixth Avenue all the way down to downtown districts. We now get similar rents on Park Avenue versus, say, 770 Broadway. So we have to be cognizant of that. We have to service our tenants. And one of the reasons that we are doing 61 Ninth Avenue, which is a deal which is small, and we only have half of the deal, is to service that kinds of tenants that we're now talking about. And we're underwriting rents on that particular spectacular location in the Meatpacking District, which are certainly similar to Park Avenue rents. So we think it's a secular trend. We think we have to participate in it. We do think, however, that Midtown is not going away, and it will be vibrant and sought-after forever. The analogy that we talk about internally frequently is London, where you have Canary Wharf, you have the city and then you have the West End. So all of those submarkets are somewhat analogous to New York. And if you look at London, the traditional markets, the scarce markets, which would be analogous, let's say, to Park Avenue, are still the most sought-after. By the way, you talked about 1740. Our -- putting 1740 up for sale is a recognition that, that is an asset that we have held for a long time. We have an enormous potential profit, and I'm talking about enormous, maybe a 4 or 5 bagger. And we believe that that's a stable asset that will be sought-after by investors. And from our shareholders' point of view, that capital is better off recycled into assets which will grow at a different rate.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, yes, very helpful. And then, I guess, a question for Steve Theriot. You guys have commented that $4.1 billion of liquidity. Can you just walk us through how much of that is already allocated? You guys provided a long list of projects in process. How should we be thinking about sources and uses?","Stephen W. Theriot","Well, I think we do have a lot of liquidity. When we look at our current cash, as we said, where we've got some -- or some repayments that are coming up that we think will be very accretive to us, including the repayment of debt, which is going to be $945 million. We're going to have to put $200 million into St. Regis to close that transaction after our partner makes their contributions and the debts put on that deal. But beyond those significant commitments, we think the 220 Central Park is more or less going to self-finance. And so those are the big deployments that are currently on the near-term horizon.","Steven Roth","Jamie, our internal budget is that fairly large cash balance will run down to the lower billion, maybe even $500 million, $600 million, $700 million because of the uses that are allocated against that. So Steve said there's $950 million of debt repayment, then there's CapEx, which will not be financed, et cetera. So that cash balance will be very effectively utilized in allocating capital to our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Guinee.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Just a few curiosity questions. Steve, Ninth Avenue development comes out to about $600 -- I'm sorry, comes out to $960 a square foot. Did you gross up your ground lease on that number or is it $960 excluding any attribution for land value?","Steven Roth","That's correct.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","$961 excluding land?","Steven Roth","Yes.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Wow, okay. And then 715 Lexington, you bought the...","Stephen W. Theriot","By the way, John, that's only a projection, which is we always err on the safe side. So we'll do a little better than that, and we'll let you know when it's over.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. 715 Lexington, $630 million for the -- $63 million for the land, what did you pay on a per foot basis? And what's the sort of implied cap in terms of getting rid of the ground lease payment?","Steven Roth","I don't have those numbers at my fingertips. The deal was initiated by a third-party bid to the owner of the land, who -- so it was a real live bid. We had a ROFO, which we struggled a little bit because the price is high, but in the end, we exercised it. The computation that led the cap rate for the land payments, saving payment, is important, but it's not the main thing that we looked at. The land lease had a turn in the 30s of years, which is very short. So we had the prospects of losing that asset. 30 years is probably long to some people on the phone, but it's not long to a real estate investor. And so what we did, the calculation was -- first of all, we had to match a price. The calculation that we made was twofold. First, what was the building when we combined the 2 estates, our leasehold with the ground, the fee interest be worth. And we divided up the interest of the leasehold and the fee estate, and it turned out that we thought that while the cap rate on the $63 million land was very low that there was value, for sure, in the ground. The second part of it is, is that we own the building contiguous to it to the east, 150 East 58th Street, where we have very significant, which is across the street from the Bloomberg Tower, directly across the street by the way, where we have redevelopment opportunities. And then we also are in contact with our neighbors to the south for redevelopment opportunities. So this quarter is the keystone, and we wish we would have bought it cheaper, but that's the thinking that went into that transaction.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","You bring up a great point. One of your other public peers just sold their -- or sold a leasehold -- sold a fee position, I'm sorry. Is there some investors out there who are aggressively trying to buy the ground positions on various assets in New York right now?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is yes. I mean, ground positions are extremely dear. They sell for extremely low returns, and they're very valuable. I think the thing that you're alluding to was basically that was more of a financing than a piece of real estate.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Got you, okay. All right. And then just a question for both David and for Mitchell. If you took your -- David, if you took your mark-to-markets and your CapEx expended for New York, and you took out 770 Broadway, what would it look like? And then the same sort of question for Mitchell is if you looked at Crystal City and maybe Skyline versus the CBD, what would your negative 4, negative 9s look like for each of the submarkets within DC?","Stephen W. Theriot","I'm not sure that we -- there's a lot of papers being shuffled around here, John. I'm not sure that we have the exact number.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Steve, you can just give us sort of some general and whether it's widely divergent or somewhat similar between the 2 markets. And if you say with the authority, we'll all believe you.","Stephen W. Theriot","No, we're not going to do that. We're going to tell you this, which are the transparent facts. I don't think we have the facts sufficient to give it to you on the call. We'll get to you offline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Steve, given the progress you've made on the simplification front, assuming the pending strip center's been, I guess, completed, in your mind, are you finished and the rest of what needs to be done is just a little bit of blocking and tackling?","Steven Roth","John -- I hope I'm not finished, Ross. The answer to that is you're asking about succession and when did they throw me out of here?","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","No, no, no. Actually, no. I mean, well, that's part of it, but...","Steven Roth","Well, okay, then I'll give you an assessment about...","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is the company where you want it in terms of...","Steven Roth","I'll give you the [indiscernible], and you're asking for 2 things, okay. How well so are we going to transform the company, which is, I guess, the guts of the question. And the second thing is when are they going to throw me out of here, okay. So let me take the first, first. We are, and I think we have shown a willingness to do what it takes to optimize shareholder value. So we try to run the company and think as if we were owners, not as if we were managers. And we try to run the company to create lasting shareholder value. The transformative events that we have done over the last, say, 3 years, which is selling certain assets, selling businesses, focusing -- acquiring in a very focused way, et cetera, have had -- we're very happy with the results. There are some other transformative, potential activities that we are considering. And we have nothing to report on that. We said, somebody asked me a call ago or 2 calls ago, are we going to split off and spin off street retail. Are we going to spin off or sell the Mart? Are we going to spin off or sell 555 California? So since we are a company and a management and a board that seems to be focused on creating value and doing things which are extraordinary-type transactions, then the people who follow us and invest with us want to know what we're going to do. That's the essence of what your question is. So we have said we are thinking about all of those things. We have nothing to report, but everything, as I've said, a couple of years ago, in my letter, everything is on the table to create a focused company, which is -- improves shareholder value. So having said that, we -- I guess, what I think we've done is we've done some of the easy, obvious things, the things that we may do in the future, which by the way, I caveat to you, likely we will not, okay? So we think we have more studying to do. We're not done yet. When we're done, I'm certainly going to be the first one to tell you. The second part of it is that I am -- who I am, I am the age, I am. And the board and I are obviously considering what happens after me. And this is an extremely important thing for me personally, and for the company. And there's no rush on it, but it's certainly something that we talk about and think about all the time, which is our responsibility.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, I appreciate all of that. The follow-up, and I don't know if John Guinee was getting to this, I lost track of his last question. Do you guys have a ballpark of what the mark-to-market is on your New York street retail rents?","Steven Roth","I think we do, but I don't think we've disclosed that, and it's more like a guess. The other thing is that with the street retail rents, there's 2 mark-to-markets. There's -- I mean, we can put on a spreadsheet what the contract rent is for each of the 60 odd assets we own versus what the market is. But the other thing is, these rents trend. And so the most interesting number is what might the rents trend to 3 years from now, 5 years from now, et cetera. So we have a ballpark number. It's not something that we formalize. It's not something that we publish. But it's actually very attractive, and we think that this is, as I've said many times, we think that this is an extraordinary business, okay. You know what? I'm going to use your question, which is really not to the point, but there's an interesting thing that I want to get into your thinking. The Wall Street Journal yesterday published an article on Page A18 about Valentino's new flagship that they opened on Fifth Avenue. And as I said in my remarks, that is contiguous to the south of the St. Regis investment that we just made. And then contiguous on the north side is the new 40,000-square-foot public store anyway. So a gentleman by the name of Stefano Sassi, who's the CEO of Valentino, in this article said the following. \"Fifth Avenue is the center of the world. Having a store here is a key message to the market.\" He also said that, the flagship store on Fifth Avenue sends the message Valentino was very ambitious about development. It's a very strong statement, though. What I'm saying basically is these street retail assets in some of these very, very scarcest of locations are unbelievably irreplaceable, high-demand assets. And while -- so I've said enough.","Operator","Our next question is from Brad Burke.","Bradley K. Burke - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping that you could expand on your plans at Penn Plaza, particularly as we see some of your bigger redevelopment projects wrap up. I assume that this is going to become a bigger area of focus. So I wanted to get an update on what you're thinking about at Hotel Penn, and also what you're thinking about in Penn Plaza, outside of Hotel Penn?","Steven Roth","Thanks for the question, Brad. A couple of things. We are in a great spot in Penn Plaza. We are unbelievably happy and excited about it from many different perspectives, and let's focus for the moment on just wealth creation and value. So we have enormous holdings. We are full. As David said, we're over 97%. We have been over -- in our office holdings there. We have been over 97% for the last 15 years, including in recessionary times. We are the low-cost producer. And by the way, as I've said repeatedly, the tilting of the island to the south and the west enormously benefits the Penn Plaza district in many different ways. So the average rents in Penn Plaza are what now, David, $55?","David R. Greenbaum","Maybe a tad higher, Steve.","Steven Roth","Okay. So just a tad higher than $55 a foot, which really in this marketplace makes the current Penn Plaza rent dynamics, office rent dynamics, the low-cost producer, which is not a bad place to be in. We believe that based upon the geography of Manhattan and what's going on in terms of our customers, meaning the tenants, the marketplace -- we should be able to achieve market rents in Penn Plaza of $65, $75 and then $85 a foot. There's no reason that those numbers can't be achieved over time. Now just as I mentioned that, take the midpoint of the numbers that I just threw, I'll say $20 a foot, times the better part of 8 million square feet of office space, that's $160 million a year of potential revenue which goes right to the bottom line, with the exception of a small amount that will be -- as the rents go up, the real estate taxes will go up a little bit. So that's a very, very large number. If you put any kind of a cap rate on that, that creates billions and billions of dollars of shareholder value. Now in order to achieve those kinds of ambitions, we have to \"transform that neighborhood.\" We have to change the neighborhood. We are hard at work. And by the way, I have said -- I think I've said it in my letter this year, the big kahuna in this company will be the success that we are able to achieve in transforming the Penn Plaza district and in achieving higher market rents for the assets that we have accumulated there, okay? So we're hard at work doing that. And it will require world-class sport in terms of architecture and design, which we are up to our eyeballs in. It will require not insignificant dollars of investment, all of which we are involved in and prepared to do. Now the Hotel Pennsylvania is a different kettle of fish. As you may remember, we have an approval to build a better part of a 3 million square foot financial services-oriented tower on that property, which was designed for a huge financial services customer that we had a deal with, that went away in the great recession. So we have an enormous entitlement, including ULURP the full process, et cetera, which is sitting on our shelves. We abandoned that because it seemed highly unlikely that we would be able to land such a tenant, and we have been focusing in the recent past on renovating the hotel. By the way, we are in the pretty good position where we have a hotel which generates a significant amount of EBITDA, which is a holding action for what we may do with that asset in the future. And we have lately been getting some very interesting intriguing incomings as to office tenants that might want that site. So we are going down 2 paths. One path is the renovation of the hotel, which will drive more income and improve the neighborhood, and the second is putting our big toe into the marketplace to explore the opportunity to land a major anchor tenant for the site and the Penn Plaza district. So we are up to our eyeballs in it. We don't have anything specific that we're going to -- that we're able to go to public with yet. This is not a short-term endeavor. It's 3 or 4 square blocks of the City of New York in a very, very, very crowded district on top of the busiest train station in North America, et cetera. So we're excited about it. And other than that, I don't have a whole lot that I can tell you.","Bradley K. Burke - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So we should be thinking about the $250 million to $300 million you've talked about for the Hotel Penn is being on hold at this point until you figure out what you want to do, if anything, for 15 Penn Plaza, which -- assume that's what you're still calling at?","Steven Roth","Well, the answer to that is yes, but you can also think that we will investment multiples of that number in the district and in the surrounds and in the office buildings that we own there. So the capital that we, and the improvements that we're going to make in that district will go well beyond just the Hotel Pennsylvania. They will go into every asset that we own there.","Bradley K. Burke - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's interesting. I appreciate it. And just a quick one on 220, it looks like the expected costs increased by about $150 million. So curious what's driving that, and then also wondering how we should think about your exposure to future cost increases, whether you've been able to lock in most of those costs at this point?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is if the cost increases are limited to the number that you said, I would sign my name to it right now. New York is extremely busy and construction costs have risen, and the price of construction is up and going up. We are -- we have locked in I would probably say no more than 25% of our financial exposure there. So we continue to be exposed to cost increases, although we have a very seasoned, very professional team on this. And so we think we have a fairly good handle on costs, but these are -- but we may err. Now just to put it in perspective, okay, we don't gloat. And there's a golf race called premature gloating, which we think is a terrible thing. But this project will be, we strive to have it be the best apartment house built in, in town. We are -- we have a very, very, very good cost basis. And if construction costs jiggle around a small number, I'm certainly not one to say $50 million is a small number. We can tolerate that kind of exposure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Chao.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the commentary regarding the expectation in DC that the back half will be a little bit rougher. It does sound like you're tracking a little bit ahead of plan. Just curious of what was driving that comment. Is it sort of the outlook for the job environment there getting a little bit worse in the back half or there's some renewals -- or I'm sorry, some rollover in the broader market that might be pressuring trends there?","Steven Roth","The quick answer is that we have a negative comp in a $5 million one-timer in the third quarter last year, which will skew the numbers to what we said in the -- 20 minutes ago in the commentary. That's the quick answer.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. Okay. And then just curious on the one park sale out of the real estate fund and into the new JV. Just curious what the rationale is behind selling out of the fund at this point. And I believe that was a marketed deal. I was just curious what the demand looked like for that asset?","Steven Roth","It was a fully marketed deal. There was significant demand. We, at the price that was the market price, we prefer to continue with the investment. CPP made a similar judgment. The other investors in the fund decided to exit at that number, which was their business model, and everybody was happy. It was a fully marketed deal, and the transfer price was the final market price that was arrived at.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vance Edelson.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to take a slightly different angle on questions about pricing for New York office as it relates to the pricing hierarchy, as you called it, and specifically, how that plays into the 10.4% cash rent increase. Are you aware of numerous leases being signed north of 20%, say, perhaps to the south and west, and others are still negative, bringing the average to 10%? Just trying to get a feel for how tight the New York market is.","Mitchell N. Schear","Vance, listen, obviously, we've had some large pops in 770 Broadway. But as we look at our portfolio in general, 90 Park Avenue, which we're redeveloping, we think we've got some very strong mark-to-markets. And generally, around the portfolio, I think the number that we've been given you, somewhere around 10%, is the number that we feel very good about.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe...","Steven Roth","I would add to that. With what we've said and the color that we've given you about the submarkets in Manhattan, obviously, the lower -- the historically lower rent submarkets will have higher mark-to-markets in the current environment, where tenants are willing, and by the way, where the markets are tighter, and where tenants, or where the market rents and tenants are paying above their traditional lower rents in those submarkets. So if you say -- if you take my thesis that rents in the island of Manhattan are sort of leveling or flat, then obviously, where the market used to be $40 a foot now getting $70 a foot, those are going to have more attractive mark-to-markets, okay?","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, it makes sense, that's very helpful. And then maybe for Mitchell back on DC, over a 0.5 million square feet expiring in the March quarter next year, which makes it by far the heaviest near-term quarter. So could you give us a feel for how much of a challenge in you're expecting in re-leasing that space and maintaining pricing in the mid-40s? Are you counting on any significant market improvement by then? And how much effort is already being put into those expirations?","Mitchell N. Schear","So I think if you just look more broadly at the balance of '14 and '15 as opposed to just focusing on a specific quarter, I think as we look at what's coming up in the balance of 2014, we've got roughly something north of half of what we've got coming up that's accounted for. And as we look ahead into 2015, we're obviously busy working on all of those deals. But I think we're just going to take it quarter by quarter, hope that we gain some more traction and pick up a little more demand, then we'll see how it plays out.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Bilerman.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I had 2 quick follow-ups, just one on the gain for 1740, just given how substantial that will be given a depreciated cost basis in the low 100 millions. I think in the opening comments, you talked about having identified other assets. Are those deals that you've already announced or those are future acquisitions that are unannounced?","Steven Roth","Michael, what I specifically said is that the gain will be used for 1031s. I didn't say we had identified anything.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And have those 1031s -- can any of the deals that you recently did, can you use any of those or that will be, I guess, in the future? And how should we think about the level of gain that would need to be protected?","Steven Roth","Well, the answer to that is I'm not going to speculate as to the level of gain. I mean, how big is the building, David?","David R. Greenbaum","A little over 600,000 square feet.","Steven Roth","So it's over 600,000 square feet. You multiply it by whatever per foot number you think might be achievable, and subtract the low 100s basis, and you can come up with your own gain. It's big. The -- we have not yet -- we have not -- first of all, we're not going to count our chickens. We're not going to spend the money that we don't have. That's important. The second thing is we have not yet internally, amongst our management, identified swap candidates into that building, okay? We're going to certainly be very active in looking at them and working out the jigsaw puzzle over the next months.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess, would you consider a special dividend or is that not part of the equation?","Steven Roth","The answer is, of course, we've done that in past, multiple times. And of course, we would consider it. And let's see how it goes. If we get acquisition candidates to swap into that we think are best -- are good investments for the company, we'll do them. If we don't, we may either not sell the building or we may sell the building and use a -- and do a special dividend. So the whole menu of options are available. Nothing has been decided..","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Again, and just lastly, on just 220, and I recognized you're not scoffing at a $150 million cost increase, and the embedded gain in that project is still substantial. But is there any color that you can give on that $150 million relative to what was $850 million previously of estimated additional costs? You're looking at something that's up almost 20%. Is there certain categories that when you redid the budget over the past quarter, that materially changed that?","Steven Roth","I think most of it is -- my accounting department is a poor construction estimator, okay. So I think a lot of it has to do with mis-budgeting. And the second part of it is that we have -- so there's 3 things, some mis-budgeting, some not insignificant cost increases in the marketplace, okay. But remember, when we budget, we do trend the budgets. And so we miss that number. And then the third number -- the third is that we have intentionally increased the cost of the building by increasing the quality of the product that we are going to offer into the marketplace, and that is not insubstantial.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I guess then, is that partly into higher price that you estimate and a higher gain on the back? And how much of the $150 million can you recover?","Steven Roth","Yes, but just like we did in the Bloomberg Tower, I mean, we don't do for sale apartments other than once every decade. So the last decade, we did the Bloomberg, and we intentionally made the product better and reaped the reward of that. That is -- we're doing that as well. And these are all pretty small numbers when you're thinking about something that could be a multibillion dollar sellout.","Operator","Our final question comes from John Guinee.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Mr. Bilerman brought up a good question I hadn't thought about is, you can easily tax protect things like 1740 Broadway. Can you tax protect the gain on condominium sales in any way, shape or form? And if not, what's your tax rate expected?","Steven Roth","The answer to that is that I have racked up not insubstantial bill with lawyers and advisers to try to figure out a proper and appropriate tax situation for that very large asset, including a spinoff of it, okay? So we've gone through lots of different hoops. Then the answer is we pay our taxes, and we're proud to. The second part of your question was what, John?","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Well, what would be the tax rate on the gain?","Steven Roth","The asset and the development and the income is going into a TRS, which is the way it has to be done. And so the TRS is a fully taxed corporation, and we pay corporate tax rates in that TRS, together with New York City and state taxes.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","But what, Steve, what would that total? Is that a 20% on gain or is it 50% on gain?","Joseph Macnow","That's ordinary -- It's Joe, John. That's ordinary income. It's about a 42% effective rate. Remember then that the after-tax dividend to shareholders is tax to capital gains rates.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Steven Roth.","Steven Roth","Thank you all very much. We appreciate the dialogue. We always learn from your questions. We have a couple of offline follow-ups, which I think we've noted down, and we'll get back to those questioners, and we'll see you next quarter. Have a good remainder of the summer.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."]}}
