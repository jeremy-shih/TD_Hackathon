So curious as to whether that's based on rate reductions that you're taking right now, or is it focused more on the competitor rate actions?","Glenn M. Renwick","Good, Vinay. That might be one of the comments that's deserving of some additional color, so good use of our time. Let me see if I can get to a lot of the points in there and -- aggregate this year, let's start with that. Aggregate this year, we've actually got rates up very, very slightly. So our aggregate rate change is single-digit basis points positive. As best as we can determine, the marketplace is also relatively low but still positive. I'm doing this off of sort of some graphical interpretations here. I'd say 25 to 50 basis points. So let's set that as a backdrop that, in fact, rates are still going up but relatively minor. As having taken them up last year, even less so, but still positive overall. Last year, we used -- and I think I've talked about this a lot, but I like to sort of get the context and then go on to some of the comments with rate reduction, which, I think, is probably on your mind. Last year, we used what I'll, for this discussion, a relatively blunt instrument. And we took rates up. We call that base rate changes. When we take base rate changes, it's actually uncommon for us to do that. Normally, we're a little more surgical. What we're moving to now and we have been doing since the end of the first quarter -- so this is not actually a new thing, it started end of the first quarter and through the second quarter -- our product managers, this is essentially what they do, is always looking at their product to see different combinations of opportunity for growth at acceptable margins. And in many cases, after using a blunt instrument, we're going to go back and continuously refine at the segmentation level that isn't so obvious in the reporting that we provide to you. So when I talk about an ordered pair, let's just think of 93, close enough, and 7 as an ordered pair for the year-to-date. That's our combined ratio and growth. We're looking -- or product managers are looking deep into their product to see where they can get ordered pairs that actually feel better to them. And if the opportunity or the elasticity for growth is available to them and, perhaps, able to be exploited or capitalized by taking a rate decrease, they may do that. An irony of rate decreases when you're at this surgical level is you can actually take a rate decrease on a segment, get a higher average premium and a lower margin. And I'm not saying that's what we're going to do or achieve, but recognize that, that's the difference between a surgical instrument and the blunt instrument that we used last year for a reason. I'll come back to sort of the reason. So where our product managers are taking a look at their product, they're looking for opportunities to see where there is some elasticity and if they'd be willing to exploit that, and that is if and only if that sell would achieve acceptable margins. Hopefully, that makes sense to you. So let's assume that we've got one segment. It doesn't really matter whether it's geographic, customer profile, vehicle profile: one segment where we're not growing very well. But in fact, we now believe that, that actually produces a very nice margin, and we would be willing to take more of that business. And in fact, given that we currently don't have as much of it as we might like, we may actually improve our aggregate margin. So recognize, when we say fine-tuning rate changes, it doesn't mean the same thing as we implied last year where we said consistently, we were going to take base rate changes. A second issue is that last year at this time, we were probably talking and we gave you some pretty good detail on frequency and severity trends. And I suspect you're hearing much the same from others in the industry. But if we have to sort of look at aggregate, you're probably talking -- this time last year, we were looking at severity 4 to 6. This year, we're looking at 2 to 3. I think we all understand we're in a business that we don't actually know what our cost of goods sold are at the time that we make our prices. We are pricing for a future cost of goods sold. And the severity trend has probably come in 1 to 2 points lower than what we estimated. That is even accentuated in coverage like PIF. Thus, Florida is one of the states that was actually, in my letter, the reference state where in Florida, we've actually seen PIF change. And there's a lot of moving parts there, so I'm not going to get overly complicated with it. And the product manager has done a very nice job of not getting trapped when the trends certainly could have been very positive and being stuck with the wrong rate level, taking proactive measures. But as we get data, and in Florida or in some of our larger states, we get a fair amount of data relatively quickly, they will respond to that. That is effectively the job. And one of the strategic advantages that I've always tried to present for Progressive is our ability to change rates at a surgical level in different states. We have over 50 people doing this in individual states with individual products, and that is our modus operandi. So while I called it out at this particular time, you should interpret that somewhat as a fine-tuning after using a relatively blunt instrument. In aggregate, rates are still up for Progressive, but I would call it flat. And I'm very excited about the changes that have happened. It's great that some of the trends have mitigated. We're always comfortable with that because that means something for our customers. It means we don't have to keep taking rate for our customers, and where we have trends that have under -- or we overestimated in our prior pricing, we will adjust for those, and we will do that continuously. All I can tell you is we're almost always wrong, to some degree, in rates. So it's a continuous process of matching margin and growth opportunities, but is at a much more micro level than we see and report on in the ordered pairs that you get to see. I know that was a lot, but hopefully I got to some of your points there.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's very helpful. Just a follow-up on that. Curious about what the elasticity is. Historically, I've thought about, when peers are raising rates and if your rates are flat to maybe modestly down, that the elasticity is more and people would shop and you would gain share. So given this environment of roughly flattish pricing, even by peers, maybe modestly up, what elasticity are you seeing, at least in the early phases, for a modest rate reductions on a surgical basis?","Glenn M. Renwick","Fair question. And again, if we try to do that at the aggregate level, it's not going to be very meaningful. 4 basis points here, 5 basis points there, not going to shift the needle. These rate revisions that we're talking about now are more surgical and can be at levels where the elasticity is significant. In fact, there's no point in doing them unless there is some degree of belief that you're going to get a disproportionate growth for the adjustment that you make. Well, there may be sales where we're simply not getting anything, and that's a pretty simple one to do. But there are ones where we might want to increase the growth. And certainly, you're not willing to do a rate reduction where you get nothing for it. Otherwise, it's just an experiment in margin reduction. So while I haven't answered your question specifically with elasticity, there are sales where the elasticity is actually very extreme. And specifically, in the agency channel, where we have comparative rating, that elasticity becomes immediately apparent in terms of -- think Google Search, where you're positioned in the results return. For our direct channel, it is much more observable in the conversion rate by that individual sector of individuals. So we wouldn't be doing it unless we felt there was a real return.","Brian C. Domeck","This is Brian. Just to add on to Glenn's comments about the drivers of unit growth, certainly, the question -- most of the response related to rate levels. This would be more so for the direct channel. One of the things that -- not only did we raise rates in the second half of last year, we also did decrease our ad spend in the second half of last year over that which we had planned. And certainly, given where we are today and in anticipation in terms of ad spend, on a year-over-year ad spend level, the rest of the year should be fairly robust. And so that will also be, hopefully, a generation of increased demand. In fact, so far, in the first 6 months of the year, the demand and quoting activity in the direct channel has been very good. And we are hopeful that with a little bit of an increase in ad spend year-over-year, that will also show quote growth year-over-year.","Operator","Next, we have Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just picking up on that point, I guess, it sounds like in the direct channel, you synchronize the advertising work -- somewhat synchronize advertising and your rate activity. Just trying to understand that a little bit more. I mean, is that what you did last year? And given that you're advertising more now, are you adjusting or do you plan to adjust your rate activity accordingly to maximize the value proposition to customers?","Glenn M. Renwick","Let me take it slightly differently, that. First, for us, it's a 96% -- grow as fast as possible at a 96%. So always keep that in your back of your mind that we will do that. Last year, approximately this time, the 96% was under pressure. So at that point, we had to get rate at a level that we felt comfortable -- forward rate that we felt comfortable we would want to sell policies at. There is really no great reason to go out and sell a lot of business at a rate level you're not comfortable with. So that was the comment that Brian was making that not only, at about midyear last year, did we do a unusually wholesale review of rates and take up base rates, we also reduced our advertising because those base rates need time to sort of work their way in through the different states that we take them. And so we reduced our advertising until such time as we felt -- and I say reduced. It was certainly not a \"Let's drop it off completely,\" so you saw plenty of advertising. Now we're at a rate level we're very comfortable with. And what I have really just said in the last 5 minutes or so is that we are back to doing what we do all the time. This is the kind of fine-tuning product management, looking for segmentation that can produce a little bit more so I get a little bit more out of this piece of the business. Given that we're comfortable in the aggregate and we'll continuously fine-tune at the micro level, there's no reason for us to be backing off our advertising levels that we had previously planned. But what you will see for the second half of the year is advertising at approximately the same level as you've seen for the first half of the year, whereas last year, you saw a level in the first half of the year and a decline in the second half.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I see, great. And then just one other one, I guess. Given your -- I mean, your size, I mean, you're clearly very large. You're advertising significantly. I mean, your PIF growth has come in, and a lot of that seems like was in response to rate actions that you wanted to take. Is double-digit PIF growth in the direct channel, is that a goal, a target? Is that something that you think that you can feasibly attain? Or from your standpoint, is it more about keeping people in the system than aiming at some potential growth metric down the road?","Glenn M. Renwick","I'm going to be a little bit hesitant to give sort of guidance there. That won't come as any surprise to regular listeners. But it's -- you mentioned something as if it's just new generation. Keeping people in the system is also a way of growing your PIFs. So every time we have someone leave the book, having to replace that with new, it's a whole lot better if you're keeping the person in the book and getting the new. So it actually is both sides of the equation. And I will just say I do not rule out double-digit PIF growth in the direct channel, nor do I forecast it, but that's what we're about. And I don't want to sound like a broken record here, but that's exactly what we do with the fine-tuning that I just went through. And I would tell you, from my perspective, we're actually -- I feel a lot better about the health of the company right now than at this time last year, where you're having to use those blunt instruments. There's a lot of -- not so much unintended consequences, but there are secondary consequences. Right now, we feel very good. We'd like to sort of hunt for a little bit of growth. That makes perfect sense, but it will never be at the cost of significant margin reduction.","Operator","Paul Newsome, Sandler O'Neill.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I wanted to ask about your perspective of how the independent channel and the direct channel are linked from a competitive perspective and whether or not that has changed in recent years. If I or anyone else is to take a perspective of an increase or decrease in the general level of competition within one of those channels, should we also be thinking about that naturally bleeding over directly into the other channel? And how do you think about that?","Glenn M. Renwick","Could you just give me that second piece of that again, Paul?","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","So if I think that there's going to be a lot more competition, say, in the independent agent channel, do I -- should I be thinking of that as also really affecting the direct channel? And has that changed much over the last several years?","Glenn M. Renwick","All right. Let me see if I can get a couple of pieces of that, and then if I miss them, jump back at me. Directionally, and I can -- I'm only speaking for Progressive here, not a comment on the channel. We have gone, over the last many years, to great lengths to try to get an equalization of the acquisition costs. So we are now distributing in our agency channel at an acquisition cost that is very directly comparable to the costs that we incur in the direct channel. That's a very important statement, and it may not seem it, but it means that there's no real macro arbitrage between one channel or another. And we're being very, very consistent in our outlook to say that consumers will shop how they choose to shop. And while it's very easy for some people to come to a conclusion that clearly, there'll be a massive directional shift one way or the other, that is not supported by the facts. It'll, in fact, be a very slow change, and we've positioned our company so that we are an absolutely equal provider of product to 2 channels without creating an internal arbitrage. There is clearly a difference in price at a unit level between direct and agency. That, we've been very clear on. Agents know it. We know it. Customers know it. But at the macro level, it actually is a similar cost of acquisition. With the competitive structure in the agency channel, we've talked about this 100 times, being really an auction environment with the comparative raters, we feel very good about that. But it also -- and we highlighted this at the IR meeting. We said the cost structure of a company to really compete well on the IR channel was critical. So we, a, feel like we compete well in the independent agency channel. And the number of competitors there is certainly not increasing dramatically. The carriers you know mostly are the same sort of usual suspect group. And in some cases, we feel very good about our cost position there. But we've also done it so that we're not arbitraging against or for our direct channel. So what will happen in terms of channel population will be very much reflective of how consumers want to shop with us. Having said that, I'm not sure if I got at the essence of your question.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I think so. I mean, at least from your perspective. There's a lot of concern, I think, that we're going to see more price competition, and Travelers has made this comment, in the independent channel. And I think we're also thinking, do we think about it as sort of a general market issue or a specific-within-segment issue.","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes, I certainly can't -- or wouldn't talk to another company's actions. But the results are fairly clear, if you take a look over a reasonable period of time, that a cost structure and segmentation structure is very important. And I say both of those and don't weight one over the other because in an auction environment, it's really important to have your rates right at the individual risk level, not at the macro level. And the cost structure is more of a macro issue. We feel very good about our strategy there, and I think it's being supported. I am clearly hopeful that we'll start to be reporting growth numbers in our agency channel. You saw a narrowing of the gap in the second quarter and a growth into the direct channel. I reported at the IR meeting that, in fact, demand in both channels is strong. So we're about capitalizing on that. And the relative competition in the agency channel is not something that I think is higher or different now and don't project it to be significantly different going forward. I am sure everybody is trying their best to do what they do. And with the agent -- with the direct channel, we have, on previous occasions, tried to give you a perspective or our perspective. I'm sure you have one for yourself. But cost of entry for direct carriers is just extraordinarily high, so the likelihood of the landscape on direct changing dramatically seems low to me. And those usual suspects that you know well now will be the ones that will play in that segment.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I'd like to -- one more question, but changing gears a little bit. I know you folks have looked at the new accounting ED, and I wanted to know if you have any thoughts and comments and whether or not that might have any effect on kind of how you think about your financial targets.","Glenn M. Renwick","Brian, you want to take that one?","Brian C. Domeck","Sure, yes. We certainly have kept abreast of disclosures. We actually think today's accounting treatment for insurance contracts and loss reserves and the like actually work pretty well. So we're comfortable with the accounting treatments today. And in large part, we have some concerns that the changes will create a little bit more subjectivity and less comparability across companies. So for those reasons, we have a little bit of a concern with them, but we continue to follow it. We continue to participate in discussions about those. I certainly won't issue a comment on the disclosure draft, but that's our current thinking. We think today's accounting for both short-term insurance contracts and loss reserves is pretty good. It's easy to compare across companies, and we think it's adequate disclosures.","Operator","Mike Zaremski, Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question is on comparative raters. A couple of competitors have talked about the third-party comparative raters within the agency channel causing disruption. I noticed in the 10-Q, you guys talked about helping your quoting activity due to, I guess, California adopting comparative raters. So I was curious, are the comparative raters a good thing for Progressive, and is this -- are the comparative raters only in a select number of states and kind of rolling out into more states as time goes on?","Glenn M. Renwick","If you'd asked that question about 4 years ago, I probably would have gone into some philosophical rant about whether I thought it was good or not. But now, I would say they're here. That is the landscape, so it doesn't really matter whether it's good or bad. What it means is you have to understand that's how you're going to play in the agency channel. And that puts a premium on the companies who can truly segment and have every price presented. You do not want to win when you have that one bad sell, it will be -- a bad sell, i.e. we price 16-year-olds at the wrong price. So just to make this very simple, that's not quite that simple, but if a company has 16-year-olds at the wrong price, lo and behold, they'll win on the comparative rater on a regular and frequent basis, and you will see that show up in margin. So it puts a premium on being able to have what I'm -- I'm looking at Progressive entirely. So you have views on other companies, what is a fundamental strength of Progressive of segmenting and trying to get every combination of rates right because it will be exposed faster than ever before through comparative raters. One could say that, that means that the loss ratio for the entire industry will be at the lowest level that is acceptable for the industry because there is no opportunity -- or there are lower opportunities for, \"I put business with someone, it was slightly higher rate, maybe it was a commission issue.\" Might have been whatever combination that someone wants, but on a comparative rater, you're going to actually drive to at least a lower level of pricing. It doesn't mean an agent -- you'd have to ask agents, but it doesn't mean an agent always places someone with the lowest level. I'm sure they only accept carriers that they're comfortable with on their comparative raters. So you should not assume that every company is on every agent's display of comparative raters.","It is an agent first makes the determination of who they want to represent, and then, only those companies are presented. So it's not an absolute auction of the entire market at any given time. It's an auction within the agent's selection of companies they're comfortable with. But notwithstanding, it puts a high premium on being a good pricer and segmenter, and it puts an equally high premium, as Brian pointed out at the Investor Relations meeting, on having a cost structure, which allows you to add onto that segmented price a cost structure that also is very competitive for the industry. So those are our 2 ways of competing in a comparative rating environment. And we used to report on the percentage, so on and so forth. It is, frankly, not ubiquitous, but it is certainly mainstream. And it serves the public well. It serves the agents well. So that's the game. All we ever ask in our business is we need to know the rules, and we'll play to those conditions.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Glenn, would you say that comparative raters are making inroads in the direct channel as well?","Glenn M. Renwick","No, I'd say no on that. If you call GEICO, you're going to get GEICO's rates. If you call Progressive, you're going to get Progressive's rate. Obviously, Progressive has an asterisk there because we use comparative rating as a way of getting people interested in our company by saying, \"These are the kinds of services that you should attribute as brand attributes to us.\" But the number of people who are proactively going through the comparative rating as part of their direct buying process has actually come down over the years. I interpret that, this is my interpretation, that people feel very comfortable that we're a high-integrity company and a company they like to do business with. But oftentimes, they're not availing themselves of the comparisons that we would be willing to provide to them. They are choosing a company, and I just use Progressive, GEICO, and when they call or more likely go online or go from mobile, they're really only getting one company's rate. What probably, in that case, both of us are doing are making sure that the customer has the opportunity to evaluate alternatives of coverage, of deductibles, those sorts of things, in a very comfortable way, something that agents may have done for them in the past, less so comparatives.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And lastly then, last question on the year-to-date adverse development from the 2012 action year. How do we think about that relative to the strategy of not increasing pricing that much on an aggregate basis? I guess, does that imply the adverse development is coming from some isolated states?","Glenn M. Renwick","All right. You're going to get that one? Do you want to take the lead on this?","Brian C. Domeck","Well, first of all, auto. The unfavorable development is primarily in the agency channel. Direct is actually slightly favorable through June. And yes, it would be specific states. Not all the states are showing unfavorable development. It would be done on a state-by-state basis. And certainly, as product managers are assessing current rate level as of today, they have that unfavorable development in their loss costs that they build up to figure out additional premiums or what the right premium rate level is. So all that is, as the unfavorable development has occurred, is already embedded into the loss cost that people are using for indications of what rate adequacy is. So I think it's already factored into certain rate level selections, at least in recent months. And the second quarter unfavorable development was approximately 16 million unfavorable. So most of the unfavorable development on a year-to-date basis occurred in the first quarter. I would flip a little bit to commercial auto, where we have had a fair amount of unfavorable development, at least as a percentage of our premium, significantly more there than in personal auto. And there, large component piece of it is in our Truck segment, which is an area where we wrote a lot of business and grew quite rapidly in late 2011, 2012 time frame but have raised rates fairly significantly in the last, call it, 9 months or so. So we believe we've addressed a large part of that unfavorable development already.","Operator","Meyer Shields, KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Glenn, you've talked in the past -- and I'm paraphrasing; if I get it wrong, please correct me -- about how, when Progressive raises rates ahead of its competitors and then they play catch-up, there's a great growth opportunity there. It sounds like that's not the market environment we're in now. And I was wondering if you could compare maybe growth prospects in that scenario against the growth prospects where Progressive is identifying profitable segments where it's under-penetrated.","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes. No, I think you got the paraphrase close enough to accurate. And when we took rate, let's just go back to the most recent period we took rate, we definitely had an outlook that was, severity-wise, stronger than has materialized. Still rather do that. If I have to make that mistake 10 times out of 10, I'll do it because we have the opportunity to adjust. The alternate is not great. So the fact that perhaps that not materializing as strongly didn't necessarily force the market to react as much as we have seen in the past. So that said, I think it's an accurate paraphrase. Now if you perhaps remember from the IR meeting, I took you through sort of a little bit of a life cycle of a rate revision and how it sort of goes from being slightly overpriced at the point of actually making the rate revision, perhaps in a hypothetical sense, correctly priced at the mid-level of the midpoint of a rate revision, and at the very end of a rate revision, it's now needing rate. The trends sort of extending a little -- or the trend softening means that, that rate, the life of the rate revision may in fact last a little longer. And again, I'm doing this at a macro level, having said this is really tens of thousands of the ordered pairs in the organization. So what we have now is the opportunity to say, \"All right, it hasn't materialized quite as strongly.\" That means we should be able to maintain our rates considerably longer. And good for consumers, and more importantly, we've got a longer period where we can go into the products and start looking for these sales. And I'm not exaggerating. There's tens of thousands of sales. It's not so much growth and margin that everybody is looking at, but it's relative loss ratio between these segments, which is exactly the way we do it. That's powerful. And I think we'll find most of the growth is the fact that we'll be able to continue rate revision, combined with this more surgical approach. So I think you asked me to sort of break it out between the 2. I don't know that I can do that with any precision. But both of those will be vectors that I would be looking for, for our continued health and growth going forward. And to be honest, it's probably 3 months longer than I might have liked.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","3 months longer of better severity than you considered?","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes. If the 4 to 6 had actually materialized, then I believe that we might have seen more market reaction 3 or 4 months ago, which would change the competitive positioning. The fact that, that hasn't happened will change our own competitive position by the fine-tuning that I'm talking about, but we'll also be able to keep our rate levels longer than we think we might have been able to. And hopefully, during that period of time, we'll continue to see, as I referenced earlier, still some slight change in a positive direction of the competitors around us. Really, Paul, what I'm saying is we're growing into our rates. And that's okay, too.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","No, I think I understand that. I want to delve into the concept of ordered pairs that you're discussing today because that seems to be a little bit different from growing as fast as possible with a 96%. If, simplistically, if you could go from 93% to 96% and take growth from 7 to 7.1, it might not be a good tradeoff, but it's more consistent with the macro goal.","Glenn M. Renwick","Very good point. Let me not play more than I would like to play, other than I'm glad you got the point of the ordered pairs. An ordered pair of growing very quickly, pick your number, at a 96% is an acceptable outcome for me. What is less acceptable is a very poor tradeoff from where you are to where you might go. So I think you used an example of about a 10 basis points of growth for a reduction in margin. That doesn't seem like would fit on my indifference curve, if that gives you enough information.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","It doesn't, but I'm probably not going to get more.","Glenn M. Renwick","Well, let me be clear. If we are at a place -- let's say, we're at a 92% and we're getting 5% growth. Maybe there's elasticity in that sale. But to give up 3 points of margin to get 5.2% growth doesn't seem like a very good tradeoff. And an indifference curve, if you like, would be where would that indifference be? Would it be a 9% growth to give up the margin? Or would you be as comfortable with the 92% and a 5% -- an indifferent point might be a 94% and a 9%. But the example you gave, I said, I don't think would fit on my indifference curve.","Operator","Josh Stirling, Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So to ask a couple of questions on Snapshot, if I may. The USAA news -- congratulations, it strikes me as a big deal. This is a large leading company and an innovator in the business. I expect peers will see this as a pretty meaningful endorsement on the importance of telematics and your IT. And I was wondering if we can get an update on licensing talks. Are you still negotiating with a number of folks? Should we expect more signings? Are competitors going to license the -- actually license the Xirgo devices? And I guess, sort of finally, related to this question, have the terms of your offer changed since the June 30 deadline?","Glenn M. Renwick","Josh, I hate to -- I usually like to try to give straight answers to straight questions, but let's just say the discussions are ongoing because, frankly, they are ongoing. And in some cases, we're not looking to disclose the names of our partner or the people we're discussing with. So yes on that. I think the USAA, I think you've characterized that very well. Have the terms changed? No. And in fact, we actually closed the period for applying for a license at the end of June, I believe it was. If I'm wrong on that, someone correct me. So we have a good number of companies that are still in flight, in discussions. But I said before, I'm sort of an advocate for level playing field. So we play by those rules as well. We've put our terms, and those are the terms.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it. So shifting gears from the legal, this is obviously a transformational story, but it's been, at least from an outsider's perspective, relatively slow to play out. And it's hard for us to gauge consumer interest in Snapshot and using telematics devices, but the data we have, it still seems pretty low. And I'm wondering, you cycle through some new ads. You seem to be running Parking Lot a lot. And you've got your new iPhone app in test. And I'm wondering if you're finding a messaging and media that works and will actually lead to incremental customers and when, perhaps, we should expect you guys to shift more of your advertising spend to really focus on driving Snapshot.","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes, very fair. I will tell you that getting consumers to engage in a product that, for the most part, they were never asked to engage in -- and what I mean by engagement is literally getting something in the mail, plugging it in. It's a bigger burden than I think, intellectually, many of us might have assumed. Let me give you some sense of the journey that we've gone on, and I'll keep the numbers because now I see other people, including people that are unlicensed. And therefore, our information will become probably a little more guarded in some cases. But as we started into advertising Snapshot -- let's just go to approximately April of 2011. That's plus or minus; my memory will be close there. We started to actually advertise. And we were getting about, in our direct channel -- and I'll focus on direct right now because it's a cleaner number for us -- about 20% to 22% of our customers taking the option. I've described it as an option because you're going to get a rate. That's going to be the rate you say yes to. Then, would you like the option to in fact put this in and potentially improve your rate? Intellectually, I kind of go, \"Why wouldn't 100% of people take that option?\" And you know some of the reasons that people are adverse to this, and privacy, and so on and so forth, as well as I do. But the answer was about 22% -- or 20% to 22% of people took it. Then we did some advertising, and we moved that needle to about 30%. And that was roughly where we were last June. We talked for -- in the IR meeting and also a couple of references I've given previously about a new campaign that was -- it the Rate Suckers campaign to try to get at a different angle for the consumer to sort of say, \"Yes, by not taking this, you might be in fact subsidizing others.\" Combination with that and -- it's like Parking Lot. We have a different name for it, but that's okay. I think I know the one you mean. We've now got the needle moved to 35-ish. And again, that's just where I'm going to start becoming guarded because there are others out there that are interested in those sorts of numbers. But 35-ish. Still a long way from a number that we might all like. When we go to the marketplace and survey people from an, \"Are you interested?\" perspective, surprisingly, you get -- and I'm going to do these numbers in broad terms. Hopefully, they're illustrative for you, but they will not be accurate and the survey was done some time ago. You get about 30% of people saying, \"Yes, why not?\" You get another 30% of people saying, \"Maybe. I need to know more.\" And you get about 40% of the people saying, \"No way in hell.\" So think about that as the challenge. Now can I say for sure we got the full 30% that would say \"Yes,\" and we're just starting to penetrate the maybes? That would seem like a bit of a stretch based on the numbers. But hopefully, that is a fair understanding. We will -- we're body punching here. We're trying to find the message that actually moves the needle. And it's a very significant -- I think this is the first time I said this. I think we now understand how significant a burden it is to try to educate consumers to do something that wasn't the natural buying or engagement process with a product for their lifetime, for the most part. So it's a very new, very different process. While we can all understand it from a business perspective, getting that level of engagement is quite a task. We're up for it. We're not turning back. We're going to -- I shouldn't even thinking about turning back. There's no reason. You've seen some of our numbers. The real issue is we're just going to keep body punching until we find a combination of messages that really make sense because we think there is still a latent demand out there that, if they knew more and appreciated the benefits -- and in many cases, those benefits are substantial -- then we win in a big way. I think we've told you that our Snapshot customers that come to us that ultimately get a discount, you've seen some of the distributions on that, retain longer. So this is not just about getting new customers. This is about getting the right kind of customers and the customers who retain longer. Those who get a significant discount retain significantly longer and probably have a price point that they could no longer go and shop in the marketplace because it just isn't a comparable price to anyone else's offering. So we got all the reasons in the world to keep going at this. But to say that there is a magic formula on the advertising that breaks through into that category of people who are maybes, we think we're getting there. We're going to keep going. And this is a battle worth winning.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Meredith, UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Glenn, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the PLEs. And I understood that the rate increases had some impact of that, but is there anything else going on there, any initiatives to try to get that in the right direction?","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes. Fair enough. The PLEs are just not what we want, probably not what you want. But I'll speak for myself, definitely not what I want. Lots of initiatives inside the company, not going to go laundry list on those, but you can assume that those are going on and would have been going on anyway. So don't assume that's directly related to the rate revision. That's the kind of intensity we've had on retention. There's always some new things. And in fact, I was just reading some of the business reviews on that recently. So happy with the activity there. There's also -- and this was directly related to the more recent environment. There were studies done with regard to both NPS and, to some extent, PLE, which is a more business measure, but NPS is a proxy for that, Net Promoter Score, to see if there are other driving factors other than price. So one of the dangers when you do something like take price up and you see a fall and you say, \"Yes, as expected,\" you certainly don't want to be lulled into some complacency that, in fact, there's also something else going on at the same time and you're not seeing it. So we have looked and looked and looked for that, and we don't see anything that is an additional driver other than price. So that gives rise to my confidence that we will start to see an appropriate reversal of our PLEs to expectancies that feel more consistent with where we were. That will be the price effect. The internal initiatives to try to keep getting PLE extension, those will be on top of that to try and take it to new levels, which is certainly not where we are right now. And I hope -- I doubt that the next conference call will be much more than directional, but -- because these things change slowly, but I hope that, that's a question that we'll be addressing pretty openly 6 months from now with some different answers. But the actions are fine. And at least the primary causation seems to be exactly the way we are reporting it.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then, the second question. Just curious, I note the policy acquisition ratio is coming down, obviously with the mix shift, as well as some accounting stuff. Is there anything else in there that's been happening with respect to your commission rates or contingencies or anything like that, that's caused it to decline fairly quickly in the last, call it, year? And should we expect it to level out, or should it continue to go down?","Glenn M. Renwick","I think you meant the expense ratio.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The policy acquisition cost specifically.","Brian C. Domeck","Okay. Commission levels really haven't changed much in the last several years. We have previously talked about, I think, of a range 10 to 10.5, and it has basically stayed in that area. So that would not be a driver of an increase in policy acquisition cost. And in fact, I'm actually pleased with our overall expense structure. We've actually made some gains on our expense structure relative to a year ago, and a large part of that certainly is a function of the higher premium per unit. But we've been able to maintain staffing levels at relatively flat staffing levels versus a year ago. So compensation-related costs are growing at less than our premium growth rates. So we're actually making some progress on that. And I mean, we still need to continue to have diligence around that. But that would be core essential to what we do. But the specific question around commission rates changing or contingencies changing much, no, that would not be a driver.","Glenn M. Renwick","New and real split for direct.","Brian C. Domeck","Was that helpful or confusing or...","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's helpful.","Operator","Next, we have Robert Glasspiegel, Janney Capital.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if I could shift to the upper left side of the balance sheet. You made a successful surgical move into equities a few years back, and you're move into shortening the portfolio and the bonds has taken more patience to play out, perhaps. But with the 70 basis points increase in rates, I was wondering if you could say whether that changes anything dramatically from an investment point of view, recognizing that you tweak within pretty narrow bands, what you might do. But on the margin, is there anything changing?","Glenn M. Renwick","Bill, do you want to field that one?","William M. Cody","Sure. I think on the margin's the right word. As rates grows late in the quarter, and particularly in June, it provided some opportunities to put money to work in the fixed income states with slightly longer durations. We moved the duration out just a little bit, but we're still under 2 years. And then, as rates rose for products other than treasuries, it gave us a few opportunities to find some attractive investments there. But it's not a wholesale strategic shift. We're still and always thinking about our investment portfolio from a total term basis and protecting our capital. So year-to-date, we're still up and contributing to our book value from the investment perspective. And second quarter, we were, call it, either side of flat, which held pretty good, given the environment. But as rates go up, and hopefully more, we'll have a few more opportunities to do something there.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Do you have a specific view on munis, which have gotten hit more than the rest of the bond market this quarter? Some are arguing they that could be attractive, no?","William M. Cody","We have added to our muni portfolio. And particularly in June, we were lightened up on it earlier in the year. There, I'd say munis -- longer-maturity munis were hit particularly hard. The front end of the munis held up a fair bit better than the long end did. And we happened to be in the front end of the curve, largely to protect our capital. So our muni portfolio was not hit as badly as longer munis were. And we did add to that somewhat.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So are you saying you're adding munis to the mix, or you're just adding munis within the mix of your normal bond portfolio?","William M. Cody","Our muni percentage hasn't changed dramatically, but it's gone up a little bit. We had some opportunities to add munis. They're always part of our mix. So they've always been part of our mix. But there were some attractive opportunities in munis as that market sold off. And there were a fair amount of sellers as you looked at funds flow data. It was across lots of sectors, whether it was high-yield or corporates, munis, et cetera, but particularly -- munis were particularly hard hit from funds flow perspective, so it gave us some opportunity to pick up a few bonds at attractive levels when others were selling more aggressively.","Operator","That was our final question.

We continue to be thrilled with our results across the board and probably, more importantly, our plans to continue to gain market share. That said if you have been watching the commercial lines results they are nothing short of phenomenal on both growth and profitability. And in addition, we have taken this last couple of years to really invest in IT and talent, and we\u2019re going to talk a lot about that today and the addressable markets that we are really running into and excited about and we are going to have a couple of guests give you a lot of details.","This slide might be familiar in a little bit different form, but when we started this webcast, we literally wanted to look at the overall P&C addressable market and understand where Progressive plays and where we win. In the last couple of years, we\u2019ve really focused mostly on the Personal Lines section, which is more than half of the P&C industry, and more specifically on auto and home, especially as we integrated ASI to Progressive Home and we have shared with you the four pillars and our cornerstones and really our ability to continue to grow market share on the auto, on the home and of course in our bundles the Robinson and we\u2019ve proven that we can do that. The great news here is that we are less than 9% share on the Personal Lines side of the whole P&C market. So we still have a lot of runway. And as I am sure you have read, our highest growing segment is the Robinsons. The other half of this is the Commercial Lines addressable market, which is nearly half of the overall P&C market at $328 billion.","Let\u2019s take a look at what we will call a down \u2013 I don\u2019t know, walk-through in Commercial Lines, where we are going to play and where we believe we are going to win. And I am going to start with that orange segment and I will work counterclockwise. So the orange segment is where we are now, monoline commercial auto, it\u2019s almost $14.5 billion addressable market. We have been doing really well there for decades. Right now, we are the number one commercial auto writer with 22% market share. And with our advanced segmentation in our talent, we really believe we can even gain more market share.","The next tranche to the left of that in green is small fleet. So think of small fleet as vehicles between six and 30. In the six to nine, we do really well, but we\u2019re going to expand to the 10 to 30 vehicle fleets. And Karen is going to talk about how we\u2019re going to attack that market. The next sliver, the black sliver at $1.5 billion is the insured TNC. As you know, we\u2019ve had a long-standing relationship with Uber where we insure the drivers on their platform in 13 states. So we want to continue to grow there as well. The next color over in yellow is commercial auto, bundled with GL and BOP. So think of the Robinsons of commercial auto, we just started writing that this year we are going to expand across the country and we\u2019re really excited about the opportunities here. Again we are going to be surgical, we are going to make sure that we don\u2019t just grow but we profitably grow but we are very excited about this opportunity. Those first four tranches really have the commercial auto at the base.","Let\u2019s go to the blue section. The blue section is small business with GL and BOP. So think of it as a $20 billion addressable opportunity, so we are really excited about that. But think of 30 million small businesses with less than 20 employees. So we think we are going to win and we think we are going to win in a big way. When you look at all five of those sections, it really increases our addressable market to over 3 times. That\u2019s what\u2019s so exciting and the fact that we have done so well in the commercial auto market with really understanding segmentation, we\u2019re going to take the same approach to these new areas with a lot of segmentation and less underwriting. So we are very excited.","A couple of places where we\u2019re not going to play in just yet are the gray area and that is, think of hazardous materials, public transportation, and right now, businesses with more than 20 employees. Again, we want to get this right, be surgical, be measured, be disciplined and then we\u2019ll consider expanding. On the other area that\u2019s fairly large as other insurance \u2013 other commercial insurance. Think marine Insurance, workers\u2019 comp, mortgage guaranty, things like that. But for now, we\u2019re really excited about the growth opportunities and excited that the fact that we have been taking a couple of years to really make big investments and now they\u2019re coming to fruition.","What are you seeing here you should recognize. I have showed you this, a couple of times with private passenger auto. You are seeing the last 5 years of Commercial Lines growth and profitability. Profitability on the X-axis with the combined ratio inverted, so you want to be to the right of 100, net written premium on the Y-axis, so you want to be in that gray-shaded area. Progressive is blue, the industry is black and the nine competitors in any given years are the gray bubbles. And as you can see, we have always been in that gray area and in fact the last couple of years by pretty wide margins. That\u2019s what excites us about delving into new opportunities in this really vast addressable market.","So let\u2019s get to the need of the day with my guests John Barbagallo and Karen Bailo. You\u2019ve met both of them over the years in different capacities. Karen started at Progressive in 1990 in the CRM organization. She has had a multitude of jobs in terms of process and claims and product. But for the last 10 years, she has been either a Personal Lines GM or more recently in charge of agency distribution. In fact she has been integral in rolling out the Platinum program and integrating the sales force of ASI and Progressive. So she\u2019s done a phenomenal job. Last year, she was one of the seven people that we did a town swap with, where she landed in Commercial Lines Control. So I\u2019m really excited to have Karen share with you what they\u2019re working on.","But first, I will ask John Barbagallo to come up. John has been with the company since 1983, he started in claims and has done, again a lot of jobs, whether it\u2019s national sales or claims. He left for just a two-year hiatus. We welcomed him back, thank goodness, with open arms. And in the last 10 years, one, he\u2019s worked with Karen on the agency distribution, but more importantly he has been our Commercial Lines Group President. And what you are going to see today is really what John has been working, on seeing the vision of how we can get great at commercial auto, which we are and then expand. And so I\u2019m really excited to have John share with you his plans for the future. John.","John Barbagallo","Thank you, Tricia. Commercial Lines continues to be a really good story at Progressive, commercial auto in particular and it\u2019s an important contributor to overall growth and profitability. Now this has been particularly true for the last five years, but it really reflects a competitive position we\u2019ve carved out over the last two decades. And as Tricia just alluded to and as Karen will get into a lot more detail in a few minutes. We still see lots of opportunity for continued growth simply by capitalizing on the people, skills and assets we already have in place, plus some new capabilities we\u2019ve been developing. But first, I want to talk a little bit about results because our results have truly diverged from most of the rest of the industry.","So on the left you see 20-year time series of Progressive\u2019s commercial auto direct written premium growth versus the rest of the industry. Two things popped out here. One, commercial auto has some cyclicality to it and intends to move along with the larger economy and two, when the market grows, Progressive historically has grown at a much faster pace. In fact, over the last four years, we have increased our market share by 50%. So not only are we taking advantage of an expanding market, but we are taking share from competitors. But perhaps the more important divergence is the chart on the right, which shows underwriting profit and they\u2019re same 20-year time series. You see a consistent delta of 8, 10 and in some years, more than 20 points on combined ratio versus the industry.","So how is this possible in what is generally considered to be a very competitive industry sector? Well, I think there are a number of factors that contribute to that. And I really can\u2019t get into all of them. But perhaps the most important one has just been our intense focus on commercial auto as a core line of business for the company. So back in 2014, I introduced you to our business market targets or BMTs. Now this was originally a marketing construct designed for product management, but over the intervening years we have operationalized these BMTs across virtually every aspect of our business and this is important because we see meaningful actionable differences between the BMTs.","Some examples, the demand function is different by BMT and how that demand function reacts, the changes in the economy is also very different. How loss is present and how they develop, attorney representation rates litigation outcomes, all different by BMT. Certainly frequency and severity trends and other factors change at different rates and at different times by BMT. All of these things are critical inputs to our rate levels and our underwriting actions. This granular focus allows us to develop insight faster, be more responsive and develop strategies and tactics to profitably grab market share. So having a granular focus and understanding the business at that level is certainly helpful. But beyond that, you have to have the will and the confidence to react to what you\u2019re seeing, and the process capability and dexterity to continue to make adjustments as new evidence emerges. So back in 2016, we saw a marked uptick in accident frequency between the months of May and November. And on both these charts that\u2019s indicated by the blue shaded area. At the same time that frequency was increasing rapidly, prior-year loss reserve development was contributing to an already positive severity trend. We saw these trends and we reacted very quickly and in a little over three months, we raised rates by more than 10% on the portfolio and implemented a number of underwriting changes. And as you can see, we have continued to make a series of changes and adjustments over time.","I would suggest to you that having a granular approach to the business and reacting decisively to what we see while much of the market was slower to react and it\u2019s all been an important part of us maintaining strong underwriting margins and growing the business in this recent period. Now we know our claims organization provides us with a significant competitive advantage on commercial auto. This is really a combination of two things. One, leveraging the massive personal auto claims infrastructure and quality control processes to handle a very high volume of our commercial auto claim features at low cost. On the chart, you can see in the last four years, we\u2019ve essentially doubled the size of our core auto business while maintaining a very competitive loss adjustment ratio and good quality. The second factor is having very targeted specialization within Commercial Lines on the highest impact claims now. Progressive\u2019s claims organization has over 19,000 employees, and a very high degree of specialization and a focus on quality and efficiency. This larger group handles the majority of our commercial auto claim features and that alone gives us an advantage over many of our commercial auto competitors. But beyond that, we have invested in a specialty claims group that now numbers more than 750 people and they work exclusively on Commercial Lines.","Now, while the larger claims organization handles the majority of features the specialty group accounts for nearly 60% of the indemnity dollars we spend as they deal with the highest impact and most complex claims. To that end, we have 115 highly tenured commercial casualty adjusters and managers handling the highest exposure and often most complicated commercial injury claims. On the physical damage side, we have over 300 dedicated claims people for the majority of them deployed in the field that only handle heavy equipment and cargo claims. And to support our new but rapidly growing TNC business, we now have over 200 wholly dedicated claims adjusters and managers. We have built the specialty group, primarily with internal hires drawing from some of our most experienced and savvy employees. So while many on the team or new in their roles, they are not new, in fact they\u2019re very experienced and produce consistently good outcomes in line with our claims guiding principles. I believe this combination of a well-tuned, highly efficient claims infrastructure for the majority of our features, combined with a group of highly skilled commercial specialists for the highest impact claims gives us a competitive advantage on claims that few can match.","I am going to make one last point on reserving where our philosophy to be as accurate as possible with minimal variation has served us extremely well. This chart shows our commercial auto reserve development versus the industry over a period of seven years and you can see we have much tighter variance. There are two primary reasons for this. One is the claims organization I just talked about. Getting more of the high impact and complex claims into the hands of that specialized claims group more quickly leads to more timely and accurate claims handling and better estimates","The other contributing factor is a highly segmented approach we take the loss reserving for commercial auto as we do with our other products. This is another area where we operationalize our BMT structure, where in addition to the usual loss cost cuts, a BMT view allows us to see pattern changes sooner and react appropriately. More consistent loss cost estimates through accurate reserving let\u2019s us understand our true ultimate costs faster and be more responsive with pricing and product refinements. So that\u2019s a little background on what you\u2019ve been seeing in our results recently over the last few years and why we\u2019ve been able to produce some very different outcomes.","Now I\u2019d like to have Karen come up and share a little bit about our going-forward strategy and tactics, and some exciting new opportunities for growth.","Karen Bailo","Thank you, John. As both Tricia and John referenced, we have a growing and profitable Commercial Lines business and with our investments, we have an expanding addressable market that affords future opportunity for growth. The road map for growing the business focuses investments in three areas, pursuing untapped commercial auto potential, expanding the distribution of our products, and then expanding our product portfolio.","I will start with the opportunity in our core commercial auto business where we have investments and additional enhancements that are fueling growth. We don\u2019t have time for a comprehensive review of everything under way, so I\u2019ll cover a handful of items that we are excited about and how we are opening up new substantial and under-penetrated markets with more competitive offerings. I will cover preferred truck, fleet and how our two telematics space programs are fueling our competitive position. This chart specifically highlights growth in our truck segments with written premium index to the year 2000.","Now, we have been investing in our truck business for quite some time and we\u2019re excited about our progress, but also the opportunity ahead. Reflecting on recent contributions to growth, I\u2019ll start with the year 2012. Back in 2012, we rolled out our long-haul product more broadly and we also began using business market targets or BMTs in our segmentation and our product. And then in 2015, we launched a new product with a proprietary scoring model for trucking risks. That model included parameters around tenure, safety and stability, and introduced powerful segmentation into our product.","And then between 2017 and 2018, there were a number of things going on in the marketplace for which we were well positioned for growth. The economy was growing, the trucking industry was all also growing in terms of new truck sales and new ventures, the industry was also raising rates given poor underwriting results and adverse development, and in late 2017, the federal electronic logging device mandate went into effect. Given we had already addressed rate need, as John mentioned earlier and introduced powerful segmentation into our product, we were well positioned to grow profitably during that time period. And while we\u2019ve grown significantly, there is more opportunity ahead and I\u2019ll cover that in the next few slides.","Back in 2016, John shared that we saw a potential in telematics space pricing for truck. We have been collecting our own telematics data and we observed that the driving behavior of commercial operators varied significantly from personalized customers in terms of how, how much and where they drive. And in 2017 as I mentioned earlier, the federal electronic logging device mandate went into effect, and because we had already invested in telematics and had an earlier generation telematics-based product ready to go to market, we were well positioned.","And what we have learned since is that telematics data for trucking is as powerful as we thought it would be. So part of the federal mandate, most over-the-road truckers are required to have an electronic logging device to manage their hours of service. And Smart Haul is our telematics space program that uses the driving data on the truckers existing electronic logging device in exchange for a potential discount on their insurance of up to 18%. The data on the left shows the power of that data. We have policies grouped into quantiles and the loss ratio relativity across those quantiles. And what we see is that the predictiveness of the telematics data is very powerful. And there is a lot more we can do with those data. For example, geolocation information has the potential to significantly improved rating and ultimately eliminate some less reliable approaches like radius of operation. We expect the segmentation value of this information to be more meaningful for Commercial Lines, and as a result, telematics data to be even more predictive than what we see in Personal Lines with Snapshot. So while there is more we can do with this data, this early generation Smart Haul model that we\u2019re using today is better than any competitive offering out there. Results are also really terrific.","We are seeing that Smart Haul quotes are converting at a rate of more than double our normal trucking business and the savings is substantial at around $1,400. Now that\u2019s a significant competitive advantage for us considering insurance costs are the fourth largest cost for a trucker behind fuel, lease payments and repair costs, and it shopped often. I will also point out that even after applying these significant discounts, we continue to see that the loss ratio is better on this business. So it\u2019s good business and it\u2019s all incremental segmentation. So this is a big win for customers and for us and consumer adoption is strong. We see 50% take rate in our direct business, and although the agency take rate is lower, the adoption rate in agency is stronger than what we see in Personal Lines. So, the segmentation value here is real, it\u2019s powerful, our results are terrific and we are just getting started. So while we have grown a lot, we are always looking for untapped potential for growth. And we see the preferred truck market as an area of opportunity for future growth. We estimate this market to be about $1.2 billion in size and focus is on 1-to-10 vehicle risks.","Now, this is an internal definition of preferred and it has parameters around tenure, safety, financial responsibility and business operations. And this is a look at the estimate of the top preferred carriers in the marketplace, and also a look at their change in market share over time. We have made significant progress in growing our market share over 50% in the last 3 years. We estimate that we are the #2 writer of preferred truck and we are closing in on that number one spot. We have made significant gains by applying telematics and our core strengths of pricing and segmentation to really intentionally target in this segment and improve our competitive offering. The ongoing evolution of our preferred truck offering will include continued investments in Smart Haul as well as rate changes and product enhancements to improve our rate competitiveness, rates ability and our overall coverage offerings. So these investments that we are making will continue to improve our competitiveness and our ability to grow preferred truck. So another exciting opportunity for us to grow across all of our business market targets is really focused on businesses with 10 to 30 vehicles. This small fleet market is estimated at around $4 billion in size. We have low penetration today and we\u2019ve only started to put energy into it. Our approach of using objective and verifiable data historically hasn\u2019t worked well in an environment where pricing is driven more by qualitative assessments of an underlying business.","Today, we have assets and capabilities including more verifiable and objective data that enable us to use our strength on pricing and segmentation to target this opportunity. So the fleet opportunity has required us to really think differently about these customers in terms of our product, our process and our workflows, and we have completely revamped our approach around these areas. We\u2019ve made investments in our product to rethink how we assess fleet risks using new data available. We\u2019ve redesigned our process and workflows around service levels and turnaround times. And we\u2019re building an underwriting skill set was profit and loss accountability and really solidifying an acquisition mindset with the goal of improving quotes and conversion. We\u2019ve piloted these new enhancements in Texas and we\u2019re excited about the results we\u2019re seeing. We are seeing 28% improvement in quotes and our conversion is more than 3 times what it was prior to rolling out these new small fleet enhancements. And so based on our success, we are undergoing a countrywide roll-out of these new enhancements and we expect to be in states that represent over 80% of our premium by the end of this year.","Now, while we\u2019re very excited to get these new enhancements to market, I\u2019ll point out that we\u2019re just getting started. We have a robust road map ahead of us with continual improvements and enhancements that are on the way. So to round out the opportunity to pursue untapped potential in our core commercial auto business, I\u2019ll touch on telematics again. Like in our truck segments, we expect telematics to be a key driver of success in our small fleet business. There will be benefits to us and our customers, which we expect to drive adoption. For us, we get the added segmentation that we expect to be as important as it is in Personal Lines with Snapshot. And for customers and there will be savings through discounts and better rates, but also through value-added services that will come in the form of our SmartTrip program. The additional savings will come through improved safety by monitoring and enforcing safe driving behavior.","Additional savings will also come through improving the efficiency of fleet operations through better asset management and monitoring. We think there is a ready-made market for these services because today about 20% of the 10-to-30-vehicle fleet operators are already buying these services on a stand-alone basis. So there is a need, penetration is low, creating this market opportunity. And we also believe through the indemnity savings and the retention benefits we can essentially deliver these services free of charge. So we\u2019re piloting SmartTrip in six states, through the remainder of this year and we have a goal of being ready for a countrywide roll-out next year.","Now let\u2019s talk about the second area of investment, which is expanding distribution in our small business direct channel. Back in 2016, we also shared that we expect a shift in small business owners accessing direct channels for their insurance needs. Consumers across a wide range of industries are showing not only an acceptance of direct channels, but a preference for shopping in those channels. And we don\u2019t expect, small business owners to be any different. Also market projections are pointing to the growth in the small business direct channel. According to a report from Novarica, which is a technology strategy research firm, they are expecting that the small business direct channel to capture as much as 15% market share in the next five years. Additional findings in that report show that younger small business owners have a comfort level with shopping online and buying online and a significant portion of those young business owners have a preference for shopping that way.","So we believe the changing demographics of small business owners will contribute to continuing that trend and drive up more market demand. Ultimately, we see this as largely an untapped part of the Commercial Lines market with ample room for growth. We\u2019ve been selling direct commercial insurance for over 10 years now and our early approach was very auto-centric. And then in about 2012 we broadened our approach and our marketing to be much less auto-centric and more focused on ensuring and protecting the business. More recently, we\u2019ve made significant investments and additional capabilities. And as a result, in the last two years, our growth has accelerated considerably. I\u2019ll talk about those investments in the next few slides.","At the same time, we broadened our marketing. We began to add capabilities to offer other carrier products to meet the growing demand of commercial prospects and our own customers. We built an in-house agency to sell other carrier business owner policies general liability, workers compensation and professional liability products in addition to our own commercial auto product. And we\u2019ve been having terrific success in growing our direct business. In September of last year, we introduced Business Quote Explorer or BQX, which is our online quoting platform for small business owners. Now customers have a choice for how they shop with us for their small business insurance needs. And over time, we\u2019ll work to optimize and improve the experiences in both of those pass. There will be times when a self-directed online approach is the right option for our customer, and there will be other times we\u2019re calling in for phone support is the right option.","Today, I\u2019d like to focus on the online experience and share some of our success. We learned early on, there was an opportunity to make it easy and intuitive for small business owners to get the right coverage. The process for obtaining the right coverage can sometimes be complicated and nuanced and a challenge for a small business owner who isn\u2019t an insurance expert. So we built BQX to help business owners with what they need, match them to the right carrier and ultimately have them confident they have insurance that\u2019s tailored to their unique business needs.","In BQX, We have built a business quoting platform that is very capable of good new business yield and we\u2019re just getting started. When we look to the success of our personalized direct business, we have had tremendous success by advancing our quoting platforms through a continual testing and learning and improvement feedback cycle and we expect to build success in Commercial Lines with that same virtuous cycle approach. We also know that even small incremental changes in the quoting experience can result in significant improvements in our sales metrics. So we\u2019re focused on continuous improvements in the following areas.","First is increasing engagement and one of the early steps in the quoting flow, which is accurately classifying a business. The second is improving the overall quoting experience by increasing capacity and improving or accurately matching carriers to the risk and then. And then finally, adding online buy functionality. So the business classification step can be a defection point in the quoting experience, and the challenge is helping a business owner describe their business in a way that can be matched to how a carrier classifies and assess risk.","Let me give you one example. While everyone might think that landscaper is self-explanatory, from an insurance classification perspective, most carriers, there is a difference between landscaping services, lawn care services and tree services. And inaccurately classifying that business can lead to misrating or inappropriately declining or accepting that risk. So to improve that process, we\u2019ve recently introduced an advisor tool using supervised machine learning that guides a business owner through a series of questions and are designed to get to an accurate and common business classification. Since rolling out that tool, we\u2019ve seen an immediate 7% increase in quoters moving forward into the quoting experience. We\u2019re seeing the better improvement in quotes coming through mobile devices and tablet devices.","So this is really an early effort at leveraging supervised machine learning and we fully expect that our results will only get better from here. In addition to accurately classifying the business. We have a number of efforts under way to expand our capacity and increase the availability of our products to meet the needs of customers who are contacting us for their insurance needs. We\u2019re working with a strong carefully selected group of carriers and we\u2019re having working sessions on how we can potentially expand their appetite and improve our matching process. We\u2019re also identifying where we need additional carrier supply. And we\u2019re currently exploring additional capacity in the select business owner policy classes, workers compensation capacity, and excess and surplus lines, which should help us with contractor business where the demand is high. So in less than a year, we\u2019ve made significant investments in expanding the availability of our offerings and today, we can meet the needs of about 70% of customers who contact us. Now, the work that I\u2019ve described is all designed to improve what we refer to as quote yield. Quote yield is the measure of the number of customers that complete a quote and see a rate online. And the combination of improvements over the last year have resulted in a 2x improvement in our quote yield. That\u2019s a pretty dramatic improvement in successfully getting more customers through the quoting experience and match to the best carrier, based on the risk carrier appetite and the coverage\u2019s needed for their business.","Finally, I wanted to highlight a significant step in improving sales and ultimately the efficiency of our direct operations. Our data and experience tells us that some customers get confidence from talking to a real person. But we also know that many customers don\u2019t ultimately pick up the phone to complete that purchase. So, in April, we launched an online buy option for select general liability business classes and the results are encouraging. Quotes that are offered an online buy option are quoting at 15% higher rate than those not offered an online buy option. So these results indicate that online quoters are comfortable executing their purchase digitally. And offering an online buy option gives us one more opportunity to meet the expectations of customers who prefer to shop online. To build on that success, in July, we introduced additional online buy capabilities for select professional liability business classes and we have plans for additional general liability business classes in the near future. Ultimately, we\u2019re working toward a fully digital experience with online buy options for all products. So with the investments that we continue to make to drive demand and then meet that demand with ample supply and great experiences, we are confident that we will continue to grow our small business direct channel. ","With that, I\u2019m going to turn it back over to John to wrap up with some of our efforts to expand our product offering.","John Barbagallo","Thanks, Karen. Yes, this is actually a very exciting development for Commercial Lines and that\u2019s in May, we introduced our own manufactured business owners policy or BOP and we now have 144 independent agents trained and authorized to sell it. So again, BOP is a multi-line policy that provides business liability coverage and covers common property exposures that many small businesses would have. So we see this as a first step in a country wide roll-out of the product that will open up that $20 billion addressable market that Tricia mentioned in her opening, as well as begin to unlock an additional $12 billion addressable market for commercial auto that today is tied up in auto BOP bundles. I\u2019m going to tell you a little bit about the product and we will be updating you on results in the coming months. So our Commercial Lines strategy has always been to be low cost and easy to use. And similar to commercial auto, for BOP, we want to have a streamlined intuitive quote flow and we have competitive pricing derived from expense discipline and price segmentation. Now we chose to deploy our BOP product in the agency channel first and we\u2019re designing the product, systems and experiences to succeed with agents, while keeping an eye on the requirements for the digital channel. Reality is today this business is in the agency channel and agents continue to deliver real value on small business insurance.","Initially, we have a limited \u2013 we have limited our underwriting appetite to the five categories you see depicted on the screen. These categories are big enough to matter, will allow us to develop pricing and segmentation skills, and will allow for that straightforward intuitive quoting and binding process. Those five categories account for about half of the 31 million small businesses in the United States with fewer than 20 employees, which is our target market. We\u2019ll expand those categories over time as we gain experience and identify additional opportunities to automate the quoting and underwriting flow. Now, this will be a competitive product. The coverage will be on par with anything available in the market. We\u2019ll be offering industry-specific endorsement packages and some really unique embedded endorsements to cover things like employment liability, cyber, equipment breakdown and E&O.","Early market response to the product has been quite positive. And it would suggest we have really hit the mark on ease of use. Now keep in mind, ease of use is one of the things that really drives Progressive personal auto and commercial auto business in the agency channel is a key strategy that we think will work for BOP. Here, you can just see some of the quotes from our Ohio agents\u2019 experience with the product. It\u2019s consistent with the feedback we\u2019ve been receiving. So we\u2019re pleased with the level of quoting activity from our agents.","The distribution of quotes across those five categories is generally in line with our expectations. Now there is a slight skew toward contractors, but that\u2019s not unexpected because contractors is a really, really strong category for Progressive on the commercial auto side, and it\u2019s actually a place we think we can begin to make headway capturing that bundled auto BOP business. We\u2019re going to be revising our rates in October as conversion is lower than we want it to be. Now our initial rates were built off an ISO base, but now we have live competitive quoting data in our hands, we think with just a few adjustments we can get the rates where we want to be, and we\u2019ll see conversion move up. One key metric for BOP is the quote start to finish ratio. And that is very high and in line with all our established products. So we really think we have the design right. We\u2019re excited to be in this business and we\u2019re excited to expand our addressable market. We feel good about where we are today and we look forward to adding three additional states by the end of the year. Beyond that, we expect to roll-out to be fairly aggressive in 2020 and 2021, but as with everything else we do, we will take a considered measured approach, and we\u2019ll be disciplined around our loss ratio targets and our business mix.","So this is really all part of our broader vision to become consumers\u2019 and agents\u2019 number one choice and destination for auto, home and other insurance. And we\u2019re excited to have considerable under-penetrated addressable market out in front of us, where we have the people, skills and assets to win.","Thank you for your time this afternoon. Now we\u2019re going to take a few minutes to set up for Q&A.","Julia Hornack","Thanks, John. [Operator Instructions] So Bridget, can we please introduce our first participant from the conference call line?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Mr. Greenspan, your line is now open.","Elyse Greenspan","Thank you. Good afternoon. My first question is just on the personal auto side of things. In the 10-Q, you guys make mention of a softening market place, which I know you had also mentioned last quarter and you allude to the fact that you\u2019re going to continue to take rate action. Can you just give us a sense, does that imply that you\u2019re going to take some rate clients from here as you look to maintain your growth levels in a softening market, if you could just give us a sense of what to expect from you guys on the rate side of things?","Tricia Griffith","Absolutely, thanks, Elyse, before I answer that question, you\u2019ll notice that I have two Johns with me, because we had so much information on Commercial Lines, we thought it\u2019d be best to have John Barbagallo up here as well to answer any questions you have about what we presented today, really anything about Commercial Lines. So if you have a specific question on that, just make sure you say John Barbagallo or John B or John S, just wanted to clarify that. So yes, Elyse, we\u2019ve seen the market continues to soften, and so less shopping. And as usual we look channel by channel, state by state, segment by segment, to see opportunities where we believe we can either increase inversion due to the competitors\u2019 actions to grow rate. And with that we have taken several actual rate decreases. And we mentioned that as well. So we were going to do, like we\u2019ve done in the past though, because I don\u2019t want to overshoot, because there\u2019s a lot of unknown. So we really want to make sure that we continue to grow as fast as we can within our target margins. We\u2019ve enjoyed these really great margins, and we don\u2019t want to give those away unless we believe it converts. So we are very surgical in our approach. I think I mentioned last time Pat Callahan and his team did a soft market summit and we kind of went literally so deep to say what are ways we can win, what are places where conversion seems to be going really well. And let\u2019s not mess with that. So, yes, when we believe we will grow, we\u2019ll take rate action for that positive growth, but we won\u2019t just try to grow just to grow, because we want to make sure that our conversion. We know that the \u2013 marketing is working harder than ever, but we\u2019re still well within our allowable costs.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then my follow up I guess this is for John B, this is on some of the \u2013 when you were guys, we are talking about BOP and that you\u2019re going to need to revise some of your rates in October to try to see the conversion move up. I just want to get a sense of I guess how you maybe where you guys set the rates off a little bit to start and how we could think about the rate-setting as you roll out that product more widely across the country.","John Barbagallo","Sure, Elyse. Again, we have no data of our own to price off, so we\u2019re using ISO data as a base, we are building in our assumptions about expense ratios at run rate and we have introduced some of our own segmentation using external data that we\u2019ve tested. So we have a good base, it wasn\u2019t really until we got into market and had some competitive quotes that we could start looking at to see where we were relative to the market. And we believe with just a few really minor modifications to our rate calculation, we\u2019re going to be right where we want to be long-term we think in a couple of ways. One, we believe at scale, we will have a better expense ratio than a lot of the people writing this business, we believe we will out execute on segmentation over time and we just think the breadth of our distribution and our marketing power is going to drive a lot of business our way.","Tricia Griffith ","Yes. And to add, we actually have a new marketing campaign coming out shortly that I think really tells the story well, with the small business and other products.","Julia Hornack","Great, thanks. Bridget. Can you take the next caller from the line please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Mr. Peters, your line is open.","Greg Peters","Good afternoon. My first question, in your letter, you spoke about rolling out a new property product. I think you call the product 4.0. Moreover, you talked about the results in your property business being affected by catastrophes. I\u2019m curious as you roll out this product and make adjustments, how do you think you\u2019re going to mitigate weather-related challenges going forward in your combined ratio results?","Tricia Griffith","Yes, so we did roll out what we call Next-Gen 4.0. It\u2019s in two states now we\u2019ll plan on rolling it across the country. And that product really is much more aligned with what we\u2019ve done over the years with our auto product on the Personal Lines side, so much deeper segmentation, understanding deductibles in areas where \u2013 that are more hail prone, etc. And really our R&D teams are working lockstep together to understand how to more deeply have segmentation on the homes. So although we won\u2019t be able to prevent mother nature, we\u2019ll set some parameters within our product to be able to mitigate us some portion of the loss.","Greg Peters","Great. My follow-up question would be on Slide 16, you talk about your accurate and efficient claims handling and you talk about your LAE ratio and you show a nice chart where your LAE ratio is trending down. Can you talk about some of the levers you\u2019ve used to lower your LAE expense ratio on top of just the growth in the business?","Tricia Griffith","Yes, I can start with that and then I think you \u2013 specific to the commercial, if you want to add to the can and stuff . So yes, overall we have worked on our loss adjustment ratio for many, many years, making sure that we pay the accurate amount every time. We do in-depth training, especially during these years of high growth, we\u2019ve hired in advance of need to make sure we have in-depth training to really understand to get the right file to the right rep at the right time. We\u2019ve also centralized a lot of our claims organization to make sure that we have people to do similar activities over and over again. And so some of the slides that John B showed were really about the larger losses that happening in commercial and making sure that we have people that handle litigation files every day, large loss files every day, non-litigation files. So that really helps us with our efficiency to be able to get more throughput with the right people and the right leadership.","John. Barbagallo","Yes. So, Greg, the chart you\u2019re referring to that LAE is strictly commercial auto LAE. And I guess a more pointed question might have been, hey, you\u2019ve doubled the business and it\u2019s kind of stayed the same instead of going down, but the point is we have actually made a lot of investment in commercial-specific capabilities over the last few years and the fact that it\u2019s kind of held level, while we\u2019ve dramatically increased our volume, one, I think it\u2019s a positive, and two, portends for much greater efficiency and accuracy, as we go forward. I feel really, really good about where we are on the claim side with commercial auto and I think you\u2019ll see us continue to win in the market, in part because of our claims organization, how efficient it is and the outcomes we get.","Greg Peters","Thank you for your answers.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks, Greg.","Julia Hornack","Thanks, Bridget. Can we take the next caller from the conference call line, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open, Mr. Zaremski.","Mike Zaremski","Great. First question, can you give us an update on personal auto, bodily injury, inflation levels they stayed higher, we could see in the 10-Q and in the last quarter you, had mentioned it was coming from a specific number of states. And I think we were all trying to decipher whether this was a kind of Progressive-specific issue or an industry issue.","Tricia Griffith","Absolutely, Mike. So, we started to see really in Q4 2018 both Progressive and industry having inflation BI. So, if you look at our results for the quarter specifically and incurred BI severity, it\u2019s up about 9 points. Take two of those points out for just strengthening of our reserves. And so, we see it at about 7 points. We\u2019ll be anxious to see the quarter two results for the industry. A couple of our competitors that have announced earnings for the second quarter, we\u2019re very much in line with them. So, a couple of things. We have continued to narrow down a handful of states specifically five states where we believe we have opportunity for some process improvements. We\u2019ve also kind of narrowed down what we\u2019re seeing in terms of increased specials. So, more attorney rep files, a little bit more surgeries, more injections, things like that. So, we\u2019ll keep an eye on that and I think that I think that will affect the whole industry but I obviously can\u2019t count assess that. In addition, we\u2019ve changed our mix of business with higher limits. So, with those higher limits, you\u2019re going to get the premium associated with those limits. So, we believe we\u2019re in a good place. Net-net, what I would say is frequency in BI is down, average written premium is up. We feel comfortable across the board with our loss cost, which in turn of course result in combined ratios lower than our targets.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. And my last question is a little bit of a follow-up on Greg Peters\u2019s question on the expense ratio. If I recall correctly, over the last couple of years a couple of years ago, you guys came out with kind of an improvement in certain expense ratio targets. And I don\u2019t believe you met the target and one of the reasons was because you had decided that it was a good decision not to meet the target because you want to spend more on advertising. You are winning more. So just curious and then you got also a competitor recently, a major competitor come out and announce a major expense ratio improvement initiative that are taking place now. And so I know this is a long-winded question, but kind of curious, are there is there low-hanging fruit in the coming years to improve the expense ratio, and also if the competitive environment continues to increase, will the these are kind of a natural lever for the expense ratio maybe to tick down due to less advertising? Thanks.","Tricia Griffith","Yes, we look at expense ratio in two different ways. Overall expense ratio and non-acquisition expense ratio. So, when we are growing and when we believe we have sufficient spend in both agency commissions in our advertising, we will continue to spend because we\u2019ll continue to grow as long as we believe it\u2019s sufficient. What we look at on the claims side, we talked about loss adjustment expense. The rest of the house we talk about expense ratio or not acquisition expense ratio. And we always believe there\u2019s opportunity to be more efficient to understand how technology advancements will help us. So, I think I\u2019ve talked a couple of times about a cohort in the claim side a cohort of claims that we do from either video or photos that the insured send and those are really efficient. We\u2019re always looking at ways to learn new technology through that, same thing on the non-acquisition expense ratios. So, we\u2019ve rolled out many things in our CRM organization, whether it\u2019s chat through AI or natural language IVR, there is some things that we rolled out. So, our intentions are to continue to push down expenses and it\u2019s the balance of course of investing in things for the future like we\u2019ve done across the board with commercial lines and we\u2019ll continue to do. We know that one of our strategic pillars is competitive costs. We know that customers care a lot about that. So, we always want to be competitive in order to win when people are shopping for insurance, so that\u2019s expenses are something that are always on our mind, but we do bifurcate that with acquisition cost. Do you want to add anything?","John Sauerland","Sure. You mentioned targets for expense ratio. We don\u2019t have a target for the overall expense ratio, as Tricia noted, to the extent we think we can advertise effectively and bring business in below our allowable costs, we\u2019re going to do that. And as you\u2019ve noted in the Q, advertising costs are up about 30% year-over-year. In the agent side, we know we have to pay a competitive commission to bring in the business. So, we focus on that non-acquisition expense ratio as Tricia noted, we have had internal targets for that ratio and bringing it down. We\u2019ve actually been hitting those targets. And for the Personal Lines business year-to-date that non-acquisition expense ratio continues to drop. We expect that the marketplace will continue to get even more competitive as you mentioned. So, it\u2019s our intention to continue to drive or we think of those infrastructure costs, those non-acquisition expense costs down.","Mike Zaremski","Thank you.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks.","Julia Hornack","[Operator Instructions] Bridget, can we take the next call, please?","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Mr Newsom, your line is open.","Paul Newsome","Good afternoon and thanks for the call. This may be almost housekeeping question, where are the expenses that you\u2019re making in Commercial Lines running through? Is it all through the Commercial Lines segment, and are they material to the expense ratio, if they are in that segment?","John Barbagallo","Yes. All expenses related to Commercial Lines activity, including all the investments we\u2019ve been making some of which you heard about today run through the P&L for the Commercial Lines. So, we need to in effect self-fund what we do and still achieve our overall combined ratio and expense ratio targets, if that\u2019s responsive to your question.","Tricia Griffith","Yes, I think the only thing I would add is, they have they also have their own marketing budget. However, I\u2019m certain that they get some brand from the whole Progressive brand to help out as well. And that\u2019s something that we obviously attribute to each area of the Company, but everybody sort of gets it because our brand is so well known.","Paul Newsome","And then, slightly different question, do you plan to use any level of reinsurance to cap some of the different risk that you are taking here in the commercial investment?","John Barbagallo","Yes, we do, so I\u2019ll just talk a little bit about limits in retention. So, for the BOP product that I introduced today, we will have a maximum total insured value on any risk of $5 million. But our retention in any coverage group is capped at $1 million. So, we\u2019re using reinsurance to cap that exposure at $1 million per occurrence within each coverage group. So again, our target is small businesses with 20 or fewer employees or fewer than 20 employees, about 31 million of those in the United States. Those limits going up to a $5 million total insured value, TIV, is more than adequate for the vast majority of those businesses. And I think generally our limit distribution will be much below that, but we are capping at $1 million through the use of reinsurance.","John Sauerland","Like you said, to the extent we are going into lines that we are less familiar with or coverage is, we are also having quota-share arrangements and at least in one line one-line coverage I believe we have 100% agreement. So, I think our intent and going in is not only to cap the maximum exposure, but also to provide competitive product while learning and getting our own experience while we do so. As John mentioned, we come into it without any of our own experience. And we are very intent on pricing accurately and segmenting really well. So, we have to gain our experience, but we\u2019re doing so to some degree with help from re-insurers.","Tricia Griffith","I think John, both used the words we\u2019re going to be measured and disciplined because this is really exciting, but we\u2019re not just growing these addressable markets just to grow. We want to grow and we want to be profitable for sure.","Julia Hornack","Great. I\u2019m actually going to take a question from the webcast, Bridget. So, if you could bear with me for a moment. So, this question and I\u2019m going to paraphrase a little bit. Can you discuss the role that service revenue and expense, of course, that\u2019s the other side of it, such as commission income will play an, Progressive\u2019s income model in the future? This item has been increasingly rapidly over the past couple of years. Do you see this continuing to increase, what is the margin on this revenue, etcetera? So, what role does that play in our future?","Tricia Griffith","From a commission revenue perspective, we look at it differently depending on actually different types of agents in our books I referenced when I introduced Karen the platinum agency. So, those agents that are we they are broad across the board, but they have access to the Robinsons, auto, home bundles that we have, we\u2019ll pay them more on commission. If you have if you\u2019re a No-POP agent that writes a lot of non-standard, we\u2019ll pay a little bit less. So, on average, they\u2019ve been increasing a little bit but not extraordinary. We want to make sure, as we expand our footprint and become more and more preferred that we pay our agents commensurate to that.","John Sauerland","You might be referring to the service revenue and expenses lines on our P&L. And if that\u2019s the case, they have been growing a lot. You\u2019re right, and that is predominantly because we are writing a lot more property with third-party companies direct to consumers. Obviously Progressive Home is a part of that offering as well. But we still have a stable of a number of other third-party property carriers that we write a good run of business with and a growing amount of business. So that commission is recognized as service revenue. Naturally, we have some costs associated with that. We have, I don\u2019t know how many, hundreds or maybe in approaching 1,000 people in the group that actually takes the phone call. So, homeowners we have what we call Home Quote Explorer which allows people to get rates and in a lot of circumstances buy online. That said, homeowners, is little more complex product than auto. So, we have more phone calls where consumers want to ensure that they\u2019re getting the right coverage and we close over the phone. So all of those costs flow into that service expense category and as you can see, there is a slight margin there, but by and large, the intent of that whole effort is to open up the Robinsons for us as a segment direct in this case, get those auto policies and retain those policies for decades.","Julia Hornack","Great, thanks, Bridget. Can we take the next caller from the conference call line, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields, KBW. Your line is open.","Meyer Shields","Great, thanks. I think this is going to sound like a question about competitors, but I\u2019m really asking from the perspective of growth potential. We\u2019ve seen phenomenal growth in underwriting results within commercial auto at Progressive and most competitors seem to be struggling to catch up with worsening results. That\u2019s been the case for several years, and I\u2019m wondering in your view how much of the competitor challenge is because Progressive segmentation allows for picking the best accounts leaving them with sort of unintentional adverse selection.","John Barbagallo","I don\u2019t know that I can quantify how much, certainly segmentation is a key strategy for us again I go back to just having a really intense focus on commercial and really kind of getting deep and granular in terms of how we analyze what\u2019s going on with the business and then having that will to react to what we\u2019re seeing. So, I think with some of our competitors \u2013 and I really can\u2019t speak for our competitors, commercial is thrown in with other commercial lines and they manage on an account level or portfolio level and that\u2019s really never been our approach. I think we definitely extract advantage there just by kind of moving faster in a more timely way. The market is not in great shape. Yes, our results continue to diverge from the overall market, but I would say the rate and magnitude of competitor rate activity is starting to slow a little bit. So, it\u2019s potentially getting a little bit healthier out there, but I would not say we\u2019re seeing the same softening that perhaps you\u2019re seeing on the personal side.","Tricia Griffith","And I would say, from that perspective from John\u2019s team, when we need to react or when we needed to react back in 2016, we did swiftly and really, we\u2019re able to turn the corner, especially when we\u2019re thinking about annual policies.","John Barbagallo","I will say Karen talked a lot about telematics. We really believe in the power of telematics and we think we have a significant lead in the commercial auto space there.","Meyer Shields","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Somewhat unrelated question in the queue, you talked about business mix within commercial auto shifting to shorter PLE products and I\u2019m wondering if we connect what you\u2019re talking about today with that phenomenon?","John Barbagallo","I think, yes, to the extent the business mix shift by BMT changes, yes, we\u2019re growing faster in some of the lower PLE categories. That\u2019s really all that is. And we\u2019re very happy with our truck growth, and as Karen shared with you earlier, we\u2019re ecstatic about our ability to start penetrating the preferred truck market. And that will actually improve PLE within that segment, although again that\u2019s still lower than what we see in business auto and some of the other areas.","Meyer Shields","Great. Thank you.","Julia Hornack","Great. I am actually going to take another question from the webcast. And it follows on actually well to the last question that Meyer just had. Paraphrasing a little bit again, but the question is really about adding bundled customers to the Commercial Lines and what that will do to the Commercial Lines segment\u2019s combined ratio as well as policy life expectancy.","John Barbagallo","Sure. And I did talk a little bit about how having our own BOP and GL offer will at least give us access to that commercial auto that\u2019s bundled today, I would say at this time, we have less of an explicit bundling strategy in commercial. I mean, we\u2019re really focused on kind of getting BOP deployed getting it like, I think we have the product design right, getting rate levels right, improving segmentation and just winning in that category. But again, it will certainly improve our consideration for those more established businesses that do tend to bundle, and that will be higher PLE business at this point. I couldn\u2019t speculate what that will mean for loss ratio, but generally higher PLE business is a good thing for loss ratio. Hopefully that\u2019s responsive to your question.","Tricia Griffith","Yes, I think we talked I talked a little bit about the opening about that being the Robinsons and that was sort of it was our approach when we went into homeowners just to make sure that we extended auto PLE and as we have more Robinsons they have the highest PLE. So, I would we\u2019ll have to wait and see, but I think...","John Barbagallo","Well, one thing I would add is within our in-house agency and Karen talked about BQX, what we find is, there\u2019s a lot of what I would call bundling of a personal auto in a business insurance policy. And again, we\u2019re very focused on small businesses and about one in seven small businesses is actually home based. So, we actually think there\u2019s a lot of bundling opportunity there between personal and small business.","John Sauerland","One more addition on that one, so the direct business in our commercial group is a little over 10% of the business and there we are working with third parties and have had experience bundling, we have actually seen some increased retention policy life expectancy for those customers who have more than one product with us. Obviously, the predominance of the commercial business in the US is sold through independent agents, and that is why we are now providing our own BOP and GL product to independent agents. So, I think we can take that same experience from our direct business replicated in an arena that is 85% or so of the marketplace and enjoy the benefits of both PLE and as John mentioned, and we would expect loss ratio as well.","Tricia Griffith","We basically want more share of wallet in every household in America.","Julia Hornack","I\u2019m actually going to take another question from the webcast. We\u2019ve got a bunch of good questions from longtime shareholders today. So, in light I\u2019m sorry, wrong one. Give me a moment, got it. In light of a somewhat softening pricing environment, what other steps are being taken to maintain the impressive and important gains in PLE?","Tricia Griffith","Well again, we continue to make sure that we have and then John mentioned this John Sauerland mentioned this, available home whether it\u2019s Progressive Home or unaffiliated partners that we have been working with for a long time to make sure that we can have a conversion on every almost every policy that comes in, whether it\u2019s through our home quote explorer, whether it\u2019s through HQX or Progressive Home in the agency channel. And so, we continue to make sure that we make efforts around segmentation. Our advertising has been huge, our brand continues to get back, we have obviously everyone knows flow, but we have less reliance because we\u2019ve really, broaden the aperture of how we look at customers and what they need. And I think that\u2019s been really key, we have a very fine campaign coming up as well. I\u2019ll give you a hint, it\u2019s during NFL season, I won\u2019t give any more of that, but it\u2019s going to be really good as well as the new campaign we have in commercial lines. We\u2019re constantly getting new creative, you\u2019ve probably seen some of the commercials that don\u2019t have any superstore in it, which is what we call it the store the flows [indiscernible] you become your parents when you buy your first home. So, what we\u2019re noticing is we thought if we went in and advertise something that talked about home, it wouldn\u2019t increase our prospects on the auto and we were wrong, they absolutely do. So, we\u2019re seeing, because we have such an overall brand a lot in that perspective.","And I think, lastly, we\u2019ve really look at all four of the strategic pillars that I\u2019ve talked about when I talk about our four cornerstones. So, we want to make sure we have competitive prices. So, we continue to look at how we can continue this segment across the board and how we can be competitive on LAE and NAER, and we talk about that obsessively. We talked about brand. We want to have broad coverage. We want to be we follow the customer where, when and how our customers want to shop in and be serviced. And I think lastly, and this is something that I wrote in the shareholders letter or the president\u2019s letter was we care a lot about our culture. We have 40,000 people here that are all marching to the same tune. We want to take care of our customers. We want to grow. We want to profitably grow and we do it all while we\u2019re following our core values. So, all those things together, it\u2019s not one thing and we talk about this all the time, not just in my team, but across the country.","John Sauerland","And as we\u2019ve had softening market as portions of a couple of questions, maybe a few just some general commentary. The rates were dropping among competitors pretty markedly in the first quarter. I would characterize the second quarter as continuing decreases but far fewer of them and for less in terms of severity of the decreases. So, in aggregate even the industry and we are experiencing increased severity, but decreased frequency, but net loss costs are rising. So, rates can\u2019t keep dropping as loss costs keep rising and the industry continue to have acceptable combined ratio. So, we have seen some softening in the softening conditions, so to speak. It\u2019s still a difficult market for sure, but we think that trends over time will take us away from that.","Julia Hornack","Thank you. Our next caller has been very patient as we go through the webcast questions. So, Bridget, can you please introduce the next caller.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Mr. Meredith, your line is open.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thank you. A couple of ones here for you. First, I\u2019m just curious, if I look at your commercial written premium growth that slowed down in the second quarter. You had this increase in the number of states, you have with Uber. Just curious why that happened, was there some the reinsurance you bought something happen?","John Barbagallo","No, nothing like that. The Uber premiums tend to get recognized in big chunks in certain months of the year. So, it\u2019s kind of distorts the view a little bit. So that would have been in March. First quarter. And there is not a similar event in the second quarter. So, I think that\u2019s a little bit of what you\u2019re seeing. And for about four years, we grew at 20% compound rate. So, we have slowed a little from that, but we still have very, very robust growth on a much larger base, but yes, it is slowing somewhat.","Brian Meredith","Great. And then I\u2019m just curious, as far as the severity, you guys are seeing on collision obviously you addressed it, you said it\u2019s a lot of its new technology in cars. Are you seeing in the rest of the industry react to that as far as new cars? I know it is often a challenging for insurance companies to when new car comes, a lot to understand all the options and stuff on and on. Is that something that you\u2019re able to kind of measure pretty quickly and pretty well, and maybe have an edge over everybody else?","Tricia Griffith","Yes, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with our competition in that aspect, but we look at that very carefully and we continue to hone in on our models to understand what type of ADAS equipment it has, do they have it on, what is the ultimate loss for those so we can, one, give the right discounts, two, understand the cost associated with those losses, whether it\u2019s more total losses or more components that cost more. So, I believe we have a good model that continues to get better and better.","Brian Meredith","Great, thanks.","Julia Hornack","Thank you. Alright. We have one more question from the webcast. Here we go. So, the question is really about deploying excess capital. Given Progressive\u2019s recent growth in profitability, could the company being more aggressive with share repurchase activities over the new few over the next few years? If not, what other ways would you look to deploy what seems to be a growing amount of excess capital?","Tricia Griffith","Yes. We have, and we always talk about what we want to do with under-leveraged capital. And so really this past couple of years, we\u2019ve really wanted to make sure with the opportunities that we have to grow the company and continue to grow. And with that growth, obviously we have to make sure we have the right a capital adequacy. So, we\u2019ve got the 3:1 premium-to-surplus that has grown as we have grown. We want contingent capital in case unforeseen events happen, and that continues to grow as we get bigger. So, we consider share repurchases when we think it makes sense. What we have been doing clearly is growing the company and we have so many opportunities that we feel are worthy of using capital in that aspect. Obviously, we changed our dividend program this year, and toward the end of the year, we\u2019ll be talking with the board and working toward what would be a variable dividend payable next year. And likely we will use some of the excess capital for that.","Julia Hornack","Great. Well, that\u2019s actually the last question that I have in either queues. So, Bridget, can I hand it back over to you for the closing scripts?","Operator","That concludes Progressive Corporation\u2019s second quarter investor event.

As we announced in May, our quarterly investor events will now begin with a 30-minute presentation and be broadcast via live webcast. Today\u2019s presentation topic is vehicle technology and shared mobility\u2019s influence on the auto insurance industry.

We made the changes to this quarterly webcast for a couple of reasons. One, to give you some deeper insights into topics that we think are of interest to you, and two, to highlight talent within Progressive that you\u2019ll get to see more often, on a more frequent occasion than once a year as prior. We welcome feedback and we hope you enjoy the webcast.","Let me set the stage a little bit. Four years ago in 2013, John Curtiss gave a deep dive into what was going on in the industry, from a trend perspective, a vehicle technology perspective, and we believe now is the right time to do another deep dive, and more importantly how we think about our opportunities as this dynamic environment continues to change. So John is going to give a deep dive into that. We will focus today primarily on auto. And the question that we ask at Progressive, really almost on a daily basis, is are we able to profitably grow in the industry? What does the market look like? And what is our opportunity? And we believe the answer to all of those are yes, and great, we feel very comfortable and excited about our opportunities to grow within this industry. On the charts today that you see, the trend line shows a 30 year trend for the long-term view. And with inside each of the charts, you\u2019ll see the short-term view, which will be based on the last time we spoke, so the last four years. So you\u2019ll see the difference in the long term and short term trend in all four of the charts.","Let\u2019s start with the top left-hand chart, and that\u2019s really the revenue opportunity in the private passenger auto market. And as you can see from both a long-term trend and a short-term trend, there continues to be opportunities. Specifically in the short term trend, you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s been an increase in the private passenger auto market of over 4% in the last four years. So that acceleration has really allowed us to continue and accelerate our growth at Progressive.","Of course there\u2019s a lot of inputs to why the market grows. So if you go to the top right hand chart, you\u2019ll see the number of vehicles in the United States. And as you can see, on both the short and long term, that trend continues to go up. And of course, it fluctuates based on what\u2019s happening in the economy and took a little bit of a dive after the financial crisis, but then has continued to increase. And we follow those trends but clearly it continues to go up, a little bit over 1%, both long and short term.","The charts below are what we think about every day, and that is severity and frequency. The severity has continued to go up again, both long term and short term. You\u2019ll see in the short-term box in the last four years, severity has gone up about 0.5 points higher than the long-term. And we see that based on cars having more technology and the cost of repairs and also medical costs are growing at a rate much higher than inflation. So we\u2019re able to price those severity trends into our indication.","Frequency, on a 30 year basis, has gradually declined. And you can see that continues about 0.7% per year in the last 30 years. If I took that chart back another 20 years, you would see the same thing, frequency just gradually declining. Oddly enough, in the last four years, frequency has popped up. And those trends are largely based on macroeconomic information, and we don\u2019t usually price those into our indications but we watch those and react to those. So that\u2019s sort of setting the stage of where we\u2019re at. We believe that at Progressive we have a huge opportunity for more growth, and the fact that the market has continued to grow is even better in terms of our ability to grow.","What you see here is our combined ratio compared to the industries in our market share. Let\u2019s start with the orange line, which is our statutory combined ratio for the last 20 years. As you know, one of our objective is to make sure that we make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit of every dollar that comes in. As you can see, we take that very seriously. So over the last 20 years, only one year, the year 2000 did we go over 100. There was a few years we went over 96, but we take it very seriously, our commitment to try to make at least $0.04. So the majority of those 20 years, we have been under 96 combined ratio.","The dotted line is the industry, and you can see the industry tracks our results, but in every year there has been a gap. And in fact, in the last several years, the gap has widened. So we\u2019re excited about that. The blue line is our market share. That\u2019s the other half of the formula, grow as fast as you can at a 96 calendar year combined ratio. As you can see, we\u2019ve taken advantage of our position in the market in the last several years and have continued to increase our market share. So we\u2019re very pleased with our discipline around our number one objective to grow as fast as we can at a 96 combined ratio.","This chart gives you an overview of the entire property casualty industry. So the pies, the white pies are the revenue opportunities within each one of those segments. And the blue is the Progressive sliver of market share. For today, like I said, we\u2019re going to focus the majority of our time on private passenger auto. So if you follow the pie out to personal lines and then to auto, you\u2019ll see we\u2019ll talk about that $250 billion opportunity, of which we have less than 10%. So again our position is great but we have so much more runway.","And we feel that way for a couple of reasons. One, the fact that we are able to now bundle our auto with home, which we know and has been proven, that extends our auto PLE. We have a great brand, a great product on the street. So we feel very positive in our ability to continue to gain more pieces of each of those pies. I\u2019ll come back to this chart at the end and talk a little bit about the other areas, specifically home and commercial.","During the quarterly conference call, the last quarterly conference call, I talked very briefly about how me and my team look at investing over the short and long term. And I referred to those as Horizons. And it\u2019s a construct that McKinsey developed many years ago, and we\u2019re using that to figure out and place bets on investments, short, medium and long term.","So let\u2019s start with the here and now, and that is what we call our Execute Horizon. This is really about surgically executing on the plan we\u2019ve put into place in the last couple of years. You\u2019ve heard us talk about it with the Destination Era, with bundling auto and home. And it really aligns with our vision to become consumers\u2019 number one choice and destination for auto and other insurance. So when we think about big investments we\u2019ve made to make sure that we continue to grow, on the agency side, clearly the acquisition of ASI was huge. It gave us access to those agency customers that we did not have access to before.","Also we\u2019re investing in agents, not just on the technology side, but also on the commission side. So we\u2019ve just rolled out a new commission structure we call Paths to Partnership. And we are giving agents that give us more of their preferred business, their longer retaining business more compensation. So we\u2019re excited about that, and the agents are excited about that as well.","On the direct side, I stood here probably 4 years ago and talked about our in-house agency. We call it the Progressive Advantage Agency. At that time, we had 25 consultants in the agency and they would help our current auto customers with home products, whether it was ASI or one of our many other unaffiliated partners. Well, we had to invest more in that area. Now we sit at almost 400 consultants, and we are so glad that we invested in that in-house agency because we believe there\u2019s a lot more opportunities to sell even more products and to be able to service those customers.","As I wrote about in the annual -- in the letter to shareholders, we just invested in what we called HomeQuote Explorer. And this really aligns with our ability to provide service and coverage where, when and how our customers need. Many customers want to be able to shop for home online or on their mobile device, and we make this easy. And if you go through the process, it can be really clunky and there\u2019s a lot of data that people might not know, we are able to purchase publicly verified data, put it into the system, have a really slick quoting machine. So really, we are able to invest across the board on how customers want to shop for home and then of course, align that with bundling with the auto. So we\u2019re excited about where we are with the Execute plan. We believe that we have a lot of runway for the next many years, 5, 10 years. But with that, we need to continue to invest in the future.","The second horizon we call Expand. And that is really focusing on our core competencies. So think of segmentation, of service, our brand, our cost structure. And we\u2019ll start to invest in adjacent products. So think of what John Barbagallo talked about in the October Investor Relations conference with our business owner\u2019s policy. So that bought coverage for that small business commercial person. So we plan to invest on that on both the agency and the direct side. But we\u2019re going to be looking at this horizon to -- much more deeply to see what are other areas where we can use our core skills and really leverage them.","And the last horizon is Explore, and that is really longer term, but we know we need to invest now because we\u2019ll have learnings and technology will evolve, and needs of our customers will evolve. So that to us is a really important place that a lot of times, people don\u2019t take or companies don\u2019t take the time to invest and we\u2019re going to do that. These will be based on increasing the products and services that we have, maybe in a slightly different way, or possibly having products and services that don\u2019t even exist today. And to me this is really an important part of our investing strategy. We need to invest in all three Horizons concurrently. And that\u2019s how you continue to have an enduring business. And we\u2019re excited about our plans in each one of these Horizons. The best way to show you how we think about it is through one of our own products, and that is Snapshot. I\u2019m going to talk through the evolution of Snapshot and I\u2019ll be using different nomenclature because as Snapshot evolved and technology evolved, how we branded evolved as well.","So 20 years ago in 1997, we rolled out Autograph to 600 customers in Houston. As you can see, this is in the trunk of a car; it was clunky, it was big, it was expensive. Whenever I look at this photo, I think of my 8-track cassette player in my AMC Pacer, which was my car when I was 16, and I was actually way before \u201897. But what we learned here, even though it wasn\u2019t a commercially viable product, we learned that individuals\u2019 driving behavior varies significantly. So we saw something on usage-based insurance 20 years ago, way before the technology was there. Tested a lot more and fast forward to 2004. We rolled out TripSense, a much better solution. So we had the dongle that you would plug into your on-board diagnostic port. What we would do is we would send you the dongle in a box with the cord. And we\u2019d ask you to plug that in, in your OBD port, and then 6 months later, try to find the box, hopefully you found the cord, plug it in and upload that data to Progressive. While that was much better than Autograph, it still wasn\u2019t easy for customers. Sometimes they lost the box, sometimes they forgot to plug it in, sometimes they lost the cord. But again, we didn\u2019t want to kill this idea because we knew there was something in this. So we continued to learn.","In 2008 we rolled out something we called MyRate. And this was so much easier, because you can plug the device into the OBD port and we can wirelessly transmit the data to Progressive to learn about your individual driving behavior. So we knew we had something here. During this stage, we continued to test things like do we give a discount or a surcharge? And we learned a lot more. And in 2010, we felt great about having a commercially viable product. And so we repackaged it, renamed it to Snapshot and in 2011, we were able to advertise and market our Snapshot model. And over 20 billion miles later, we\u2019re very happy that we invested all along the way.","In December of last year, and I\u2019ve talked about this a lot of recently, we rolled out what we call our mobile as a device unit. So you have the option to have the Snapshot dongle or have the mobile app on your phone. We have a mobile app in 26 states on the direct side and five states in the agency side, with many more planned actually during August. Again, we continue to learn as we evolve and technology evolves, and we\u2019re excited about what we\u2019re learning from the mobile app. And there will be more to come on that, but I can tell you it varies wildly, depending on how people use their phone from no usage at all to great usage. And we\u2019re learning about how people use their phones, handheld apps, handheld phone, hands-free. So all of that will again further our expertise in our segmentation.","As of June month end, we had nearly 30 million miles of data and nearly 3 million trips. So we\u2019re learning a lot and learning it quickly. Ultimately, you want to be able to have the cars talk to us directly. And we\u2019ve talked about this in the past and we have a relationship with GM and their OnStar program to be able to acquire customers directly from GM based on their experience and the OnStar app uploading it to us and being able to provide them a quote. So we\u2019re excited about that continued relationship and we continue to learn. This is a great example of us investing a long time ago and continuing to iterate because we saw something in it. Will everything work that we now are thinking about investing and are investing in horizon 3? No, but we knew then we have something special. And that is really the point about making sure you can currently invest in every horizon because our goal is to make sure Progressive is an enduring business for 20, 40, 80 years to come. And so we\u2019re excited about that.","But now to the main part of the show, and I want John Curtiss to come up here and give you some deeper insights into what\u2019s going on in the industry since we last met. John?","John Curtiss","Thank you. Thank you for having me today. So I plan to share our point of view on the growth outlook for the private passenger auto insurance market over the next 10 to 15 years. As you may recall, we stated back in 2015 that we fully expect to see real modest growth over the longer term in what was then approaching a $200 billion marketplace. In 2016, the industry was up to $215 billion in terms of direct written premium and we\u2019re off to a good start in terms of growth this year. So the question is what do we think that the next 10 to 15 years has in store for our business. And when we look at our models and when we have internal conversations, we continue to forecast modest levels of growth in real terms for the industry over this time period. So today I\u2019m going to share a little bit more about the 3 growth factors that Tricia discussed earlier, the fleet size, frequency and severity, and also how we\u2019re thinking about key trends such as vehicle technology and shared mobility.","But before I talk about the future, I want to talk a little bit about the past and take a quick trip down memory lane. Because as Tricia pointed out, I presented on a similar topic back in 2013. And at that point in time, I shared our framework for how we were thinking about the effect that vehicle technology could have on accident frequency. And at that time and what you can see on the screen is headlines were full of pretty aggressive claims around the timing of self-driving cars. Google was predicting them within five years for ordinary consumers, and some auto manufacturers were making similar claims. So while these predictions have not yet come into fruition, our goal was to take really an analytical approach to the problem and try to figure out how to best respond. As Tricia pointed out, when you look at frequency, there is a long history of negative trend, and this is likely driven by factors such as having safer cars, you think about the introduction of the seatbelt, antilock brakes, electronic stability control, safer roads, safer infrastructure, tighter enforcement of drunk driving, graduated licensing programs and likely many others. So based on what at that time, what we were seeing in history as well as our understanding of these new technologies, their effectiveness and the fleet penetration rates, we were actually forecasting a continued decline in frequency in the future.","But reality has been really different, and our models at that point were too conservative. Whether it\u2019s been from consumers driving more due to lower gas prices or an improved economy, or increases in distracted driving, frequency is actually increased over the last few years. So our models certainly aren\u2019t perfect, and I guarantee you the next time we give the update, they\u2019ll have changed again. But they are really helpful in that they guide our thinking. And I think what\u2019s really important is that we continue to take a very disciplined view of the key trends that will shape our industry going forward. The growth and the increased investment in vehicle technology and shared mobility models, personal transportation could evolve in a variety of directions. And we are thinking about the opportunities and considerations these various segments will create for Progressive.","So let\u2019s talk about a few of the segments and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll expand over time with future updates. But we continue to focus pretty heavily on the lower left-hand quadrant, those are personally owned driver driven vehicles. So all of the cars that we own today. It\u2019s the majority of the fleet and as Tricia pointed out, our personal auto business is growing quickly and with less than 10% market share we feel really good about our growth prospects.","We\u2019re also starting to make investments in the lower right-hand quadrant, we\u2019re referring to this as shared usage or shared ownership and driver driven. So the primary example here would be ride share. And while we estimate that this is still a pretty small segment of the overall vehicle mix, we do believe that it will continue to grow. And as you know, on the commercial line side, we do have a relationship with Uber and a pilot underway in the state of Texas, and on the personal line side, we\u2019re modifying our policy contract to include an endorsement to be able to insure the drivers of those vehicles. The autonomous segments you see in the upper row are currently a Horizon three focus for us. And we will continue to think about how to best attack these opportunities as we learn more.","So next, let me talk about these key trends from a personal auto perspective in a little bit more detail and the impact that we think it will have on the fleet size, our frequency and our severity trends. Let\u2019s talk about the fleet size first. As Tricia pointed out, it\u2019s been growing at about 1.3% per year over the long-term and actually a little bit more quickly in recent years. If we break that down, we do see a steady increase in the number of licensed drivers in the United States and we believe that this will continue to grow as our population expands.","We\u2019re also seeing a gradual increase in the number of registered vehicles per driver. And this is good news, not only in terms of growing the fleet size, but it also gives us indication that consumers are not giving up vehicle ownership. When we look at this from a generational perspective, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion around whether Millennials and future generations will have a different attitude towards car ownership. But a recent report by J.D. Power indicated that Millennials are now one of the fastest growing car buying segments in the United States, and a second report by Kelly Blue Book and Auto Trader indicated that within Generation Z, the future drivers of America, 92% indicated that they plan to own a vehicle.","So as a result, we generally feel good that the vehicle fleet will continue to grow at a similar rate to historical levels. But we also acknowledge that some suggest that people will forgo vehicle ownership and move more toward shared mobility models. So we are tracking some indicators to see what changes are emerging.","The first metric we\u2019ve been looking at is household vehicle ownership rate. This represents the percentage of households in the United States that indicate that they own at least 1 vehicle. This data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey. And what it shows when we compare 2009 to 2015, which is the most recent year that we have data, that ownership -- that the ownership rate at the national level is unchanged at 91.1%.","We also looked at the statistic for major metropolitan areas, because this is where we believe shared mobility is most viable. And what we do see is that in some metro areas, the ownership rate is higher, while in other metropolitan areas, it\u2019s slightly down. At this point, we\u2019re not seeing a consistent pattern and we\u2019re not seeing any dramatic decreases. If we do see an impact, we think it will be in the most urban areas of the United States, where the cost of vehicle ownership tends to be higher. But also keep in mind that in these areas, the aggregate vehicle ownership rate tends to be a little bit lower. So the overall impact to the entire fleet should be relatively small.","We\u2019re also looking to see if there are changes in how consumers use their vehicles. The Census Bureau also tracks how people commute. And what the graph shows is that commuting patterns are largely unchanged during this time period. And in fact, the percentage of commuters driving alone in their own vehicles has actually slightly increased across all age groups. So our general view on shared mobility at this time is that the majority of consumers will use ride share and other types of services as a supplement to owning a vehicle but not necessarily as a substitute.","But we do think that ride share and these new services will continue to grow and they will continue to compete with taxis, car rentals and other forms of public transportation. Taxi medallion prices have decreased by as much as 50% in certain cities. And in others, there\u2019s more Uber and Lyft drivers today than taxi drivers. Recent articles have also suggested that the growth in ride share is making it harder for some of the traditional car rental companies to grow.","So who will ultimately win? We don\u2019t know. But for now, these vehicles will need to be insured and therefore do create new opportunities for us, primarily in the commercial side but also in our private passenger auto business. And as I mentioned earlier, we do have a relationship with Uber and a pilot underway in Texas, and we are making some changes to our product to be able to insure these drivers.","So next, let me give a quick update on vehicle technology and the potential impact on claims frequency and severity. Probably similar to all of you, I receive many alerts on this topic every day, and the headlines have a wide range of predictions on how the future could unfold. I think some believe that with the continued advancement in technology, self-driving cars are right around the corner. While others believe it\u2019s going to be a long time to program a car to effectively drive in all the conditions and all the situations that are a reality on our roadways today.","But one thing we know for certain is that investment levels are significantly growing, and whether or not we get to full autonomy, we will see more vehicles equipped with these safety technologies and it is really important for us to understand the implications on our business. From a product design perspective, from a pricing perspective and from a claims handling perspective. So let me give a quick update on what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the evolution of these technologies, their effectiveness and fleet penetration.","I\u2019ll start with the evolution. So the chart on the screen represents the standard format for how we think about levels of automation. They range from Level 0, which is no automation, all the way up to Level 5, and that would be your fully self-driving car.","So let me touch briefly on what we\u2019re seeing at each level. Today we estimate that the vast majority, more than 95% of cars on our roads, are still at level 0. And what we are beginning to see is a gradual shift to Levels 1 and 2. Level 1 are your Driver Assist technologies. Examples of this would be auto braking or lane keeping technologies. These were first introduced back in 2006, and we estimate currently represent less than 5% of the fleet, probably closer to 1% to 2%. We do expect the mix of these vehicles to increase as auto manufacturers have agreed to make technologies like auto braking standard on new vehicles by 2022, and we\u2019ll talk a little bit about that in the coming slides.","In terms of Level 2, this is Partial Automation, and this is also beginning to emerge. This was first introduced back in 2014, with Tesla and their Autopilot. And currently represents just a really small mix of the fleet, but we\u2019re paying close attention. We do know that General Motors is planning to introduce Super Cruise, which is a similar technology and that will be available likely later this fall on the Prestige package of their Cadillac CT6.","What\u2019s common at these levels is the driver is always responsible for operating the vehicle and monitoring the environment, so really the key requirements for success are to have really good technology, and consumer demand or consumer willingness to pay. And what research does show is that consumers are getting more comfortable with these technologies, but they will turn them off if they find them distracting. So we\u2019re learning a lot more or want to learn a lot more around how consumers do interact with these technologies.","But as you move to Level 3, Level 4, Level 5, the equation gets a lot more complex, as the driving system itself becomes responsible for monitoring the environment and operating the car. So with these levels, the deployment or the availability of these vehicles is going to be more than just about technology or consumer demand. It\u2019s also going to require changes to our regulations, our legal code and even how we think about insurance. As algorithms become more responsible for the operation of the vehicle, need to ensure that there\u2019s mechanisms in place to ensure data privacy and security. And some of these levels could require capabilities, like vehicle to vehicle or vehicle to infrastructure, which would be a significant investment. So today, what we\u2019re primarily seeing here is the testing of these vehicles. And I think we\u2019ll continue to see more testing over time, but they are not yet available for commercial sale.","So just quickly at Level 3, this is Conditional Automation. Audi has recently announced plans on their A8 model to introduce a product called Traffic Jam Assist. And the way a technology like this would work is under 60 kilometers per hour on a divided highway, the vehicle could operate in autonomous mode. But outside of that mode, the driver has to be ready to take over and ensure the safe operation of the vehicle. So really the challenge at this level is how do we keep the driver engaged and how do auto manufacturers make sure that there\u2019s an effective handoff between driver and vehicle. And I think what we\u2019ll see at this level from what we\u2019ve been reading about is that some auto manufacturers will pursue this level, while others might get straight to Level 4 because of some of the risks inherent with that driver vehicle handoff.","So Level 4, this is High Automation. So an example of this would be the ability to drive autonomously in highway mode. And what we do here is that auto manufacturers like Honda, Toyota, Volvo, are working to be able to introduce this type of technology in the early 2020s, maybe even earlier according to Tesla.","And then Level 5 finally, is the Fully Autonomous vehicle, and I don\u2019t have specific dates on this level. Given the cost and the complexity of the technology, our current point of view is that the first applications of these types of vehicles might be in commercial settings, or maybe in ride share or self-driving taxis where the vehicles are confined to specific geofenced locations.","So next, let me turn to effectiveness, and I\u2019ll talk a little bit about frequency first. The information on this chart is from the Highway Loss Data Institute, also known as HLDI. And basically what it shows is the change in frequency for four of these new technologies. And what we\u2019re seeing and this is very similar to our last update is that certain technologies such as auto braking and even blind spot warning do show really good evidence for reducing frequency. But one of the things that you\u2019ll notice is that the impact does vary by coverage. For example, the decrease in frequency is more significant in property damage than a coverage like collision. And I\u2019m showing these two coverages because this is where the industry tends to have the most credible information. But I do think you could also argue that we\u2019re going to see a more significant reduction in an injury coverage, like bodily injury than a coverage like comprehensive. So still a lot to learn about the effect these technologies will have on the coverages that we write for insurers.","Why is that? And why do we think that it could be different? And let me take auto brake as an example. This technology was designed to prevent largely rear-end accidents. And so when you look at a coverage like property damage, so this would be the vehicle that would actually be hit in an accident, a high percentage of the claims involve damage to the rear end or the side of the vehicle. And these are the exact type of accidents that this technology was designed to prevent. When you look at a coverage like collision, which would be the vehicle causing the accident, while a good percentage of the damage to those vehicles involves the front of the vehicle, it also includes scenarios such as backing into a pole or sliding off the road because of ice. And in these types of situations, the technology will not be as effective in preventing the accident. So therefore the impact might be lower.","The other thing that I would just highlight is these technologies are often sold in packages. And so one of the challenges is to understand the effectiveness of each individual technology. And they might not be additive because they might be helping to avoid the same types of accidents. So we\u2019re working really hard not only with our own data, information from HLDI, but we\u2019re also working with third-party data to really try to understand the specific technologies that are on vehicles and which ones show the most promise in reducing frequency so we can incorporate them into our pricing. So next, let me talk a little bit about severity. And before I get into the details, I do want to highlight that some of this data is not credible and those cells have been marked with an asterisk. But where the data is credible, what we generally see is that severity is slightly higher on the damage coverages. And I think that makes sense. We would expect a higher cost to repair due to the additional technologies placed on the vehicle. When we look at some of the claims data, we are starting to observe above average inflation rates for replacement cameras, sensors and headlights. And we do think that more OEMs may actually begin to start to require scans to certify that these replacement parts are working properly. And that can add $200 to $300 for a claim.","The other question that\u2019s out there is whether accidents will be less severe with vehicles equipped with these technologies, both on the damage side and on the injury side. And to be honest we don\u2019t have a good answer to that yet, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to have to further understand as we get more experience with writing and handling claims for these types of vehicles. So what are we doing? So today, we\u2019re making some pricing adjustments for certain technologies, like auto braking where we can confirm that the technology is on the vehicle. And we do have plans to implement a new product feature in future model releases that will allow us to expand our ability to segment for more technologies over time, as we get more data and we get more comfortable with the results of the data. So last, let me talk a little bit about penetration. And similar to our last update, we continue to see slower penetration for technologies such as Ford Collision Avoidance. When we compare them to prior technologies like electronic stability control or antilock brakes or even side impact airbags. I think when you compare these new technologies to the prior ones, they tend to be more complex because you\u2019re actually trying to design something that is going to steer a vehicle or potentially stop or accelerate a vehicle, therefore they are a little bit higher risk and more expensive.","So therefore, they typically start out as optional features on luxury models or higher end trims. And it\u2019s actually taken well over 10 years for auto manufacturers to agree to make a technology like auto braking standard on new vehicles. And so as a result, the penetration curve starts out slowly, but in this case, will start to increase pretty rapidly as the technology does become standard on more cars. But it will still be quite some time until we get to a point where the fleet penetration rate is at 50%, much less full penetration.","So how does that affect our frequency trend, because that\u2019s really the key input that goes into how we think about pricing. And so if these technologies continue to penetrate at historic rates, the impact on our annual frequency trend will be relatively gradual. And so let me give you a hypothetical example. Let\u2019s assume there\u2019s a technology that can ultimately reduce frequency by 15% when fully deployed. And based on our experience with prior technologies, it might penetrate the fleet by less than 5% in the first 10 years. Then ramp up close to 50% within 20 years, and ultimately approach 100%, let\u2019s say in 35, 40 or 45 years. So based on these assumptions, the impact to our annual trend would be relatively small, maybe 0.5% per year. And it would clearly vary based on where we are in the curve. So we spend a lot of time trying to understand not only the effectiveness of the technology but also the penetration rates.","So a big question is, is what\u2019s going to happen in the future? And will future technologies penetrate the fleet more or less quickly? And there are really many considerations here. The first thing we have to look at is the fleet turnover rate in general. So the average age of the vehicle on the roads today is up to 11.6 years. And this is two years higher than the average back in 2002. So that will be one force at play, another one would be the pace of technological advancement, how quickly can auto manufacturers get either new technologies on cars, or find better ways to use the existing technologies in their fleet.","Also the cost of the technology and consumer demand will continue to be very critical. I was reading an article the other day from a CEO for one of the auto manufacturers, that indicated that autonomous highway mode might initially start out as like a $10,000 enhancement. And so that could be a really good solution in the luxury car market. As an auto insurer, what we really track is how quickly will these types of technologies not only be available on these luxury models but also start to be available on the models where there\u2019s kind of the highest demand or represents the largest percentage of the fleet. So monitoring how quickly these technologies go from optional to standard is also a really significant consideration.","And then lastly, as we talked about before is, as we move to Level 3 and Levels 4 and Levels 5, and the driving system starts to take over, there are all the issues around legal, regulations, how we approach insurance, data security and privacy, which will all be also considerations that we\u2019ll need to think about in terms of how quickly these technologies penetrate the fleet. So as we pull all this together, there are clearly many possible scenarios, and the level of certainty around our forecast decreases as we look farther into the future.","And I also want to acknowledge that there have been periods of time, such as after 2006 when we went through the recession, where the industry did not grow in real terms. And this could happen again. Our models don\u2019t necessarily take into account hard markets and soft markets and changes in macroeconomic conditions. But based on the information that we discuss today and our internal discussions, we do see modest growth potential in real terms for the industry over the next 10 to 15 years.","In terms of the fleet, our guess right now is we expect to continue to see slow growth with minimal impact from shared mobility except for maybe in the most urban areas of the United States. In terms of frequency, even though my predictions last time were off, I do think that these technologies will continue to gradually penetrate the fleet and put downward pressure on frequency trend over time. And generally with respect to severity, our current thinking is that trends will continue to outpace inflation. So the graph represents the range of outcomes as we look at scenarios, and we feel more comfortable with the dark shaded area than the light shaded area on the cone that you see in that graph.","So in summary, I\u2019d also like to re-highlight some of the actions that we\u2019re taking in our personal auto business to address these trends. And in terms of pricing, we do continue to roll out our product and underwriting models and we\u2019re seeing good results. We\u2019ve begun taking some pricing actions for certain safety technologies. And as I mentioned earlier, we plan to introduce new product features that will allow us to expand our segmentation over time. We\u2019re also working a lot with external data, so we can try to collect more detailed information on vehicles, so we can better identify the specific technologies that are the most effective in terms of affecting our loss costs.","We want to continue to lead in the UBI space. As Tricia mentioned, we\u2019re in the process of expanding our mobile product to more states. We are doing some work on distracted driving to see if there are new variables that we can include in our scoring algorithm. We\u2019re also testing ways to potentially provide better feedback to consumers, to help them become safer drivers. And we\u2019re evaluating ways to identify more third-party data opportunities so we can expand the footprint of our Snapshot product, because we understand how important that segmentation is to our results. We continue to roll out our endorsement to support the drivers who work for transportation network companies and perhaps most importantly, we want to be able to continue to stay nimble and agile so we can respond to opportunities as they arise.","So that\u2019s all that I have for today. Thank you very much for your time. And now I will hand it back over to Tricia.","Tricia Griffith","I\u2019m going to bring you back to this slide that we started with and that is really the opportunities in the overall P&C market. If you go to the pie underneath the $215 billion auto opportunity, we have about a $91 billion home opportunity, which of course is where we\u2019ve made a lot of our investments. And that auto home bundle is really important to our customers and the retention of those customers. So we\u2019re excited about the homeowners opportunity. It\u2019s $91 billion, as I said. From the captive agency, independent agency and direct, if you go just primarily to the areas where we have the most access, the independent agent and the direct channel, that\u2019s a $63 billion opportunity. So a lot of opportunity, we only have 1% of the property market. So together with that over $300 billion opportunity in the personal lines, we believe that we are very well situated to continue to grow.","During the November session, the deep dive, we will talk to you about all things property so look forward to that.","Underneath the Personal Lines, you see there\u2019s a lot of opportunity, actually another $300 billion opportunity on the commercial side. We are already the number 1 writer of commercial auto and that we have less than 8%. So again, we still have a lot of room for growth in that area. And as I talked about before, there are other opportunities on the commercial side that we will be investing in and talking about at a future date that we are really excited about for that small business commercial owner.","So overall, when you step back and you look at the entire P&C industry, it\u2019s over a $0.5 trillion opportunity and we believe that we have the ability to really increase our share of the pie in every single one of those pie charts. And what we know from today and from what John talked about is that our industry is dynamic, it is going to continue to change. And that excites us. We love change and I think the companies that win are the companies that are nimble, that continue to tweak their models as things change and the companies that skate to where the puck is going. So we\u2019re excited about what we can bring to the growth and what we can bring to the long-term growth and enduring business of Progressive. ","So thank you for today. And we\u2019re going to set up for Q&A, so just give us a few minutes.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Tricia Griffith","Thank you Leanne. We will begin with the questions submitted by webcast participants to give folks on the phone the opportunity to dial in and talk to the operator. The first question from the webcast is can you help us understand what\u2019s driving growth in the agency channel? Is it Platinum and The Robinsons? Or something else? Platinum is definitely a part of it. So we continue to increase our mix of preferred business. And Platinum although still a small part of it, but growing as I outlined in my letter is becoming a bigger part of it and we believe will continue to become a bigger part of it. ","And that\u2019s the short answer. Really the longer answer when you step back is, during 2016 when rates were increasing and we had to increase rates as well. We didn\u2019t have to as much as our competition. So there was a lot of shopping in the agency channel. And so we saw stronger quoting and conversion from our agents. We also have a preferred product that we put on the street several years ago, we called it 8.3, we\u2019re now into our 8.4 model and we\u2019re seeing even better results from that. So continuing to understand that preferred customer and making sure we have the right rates for that customer. ","In addition, and we don\u2019t talk about this as often and I do with agents, agents really appreciate our ability to service our customers, both on the policy side and the claims side. And having that local presence is important to our agents. And they often refer to that when they talk to me about, well, when we think about the ultimate product, which of course is a claim, Progressive really has our mutual customers covered. So it\u2019s really a whole package of all of the things that kind of came together at one time to really position ourselves so well in the agency channel. And again if you want to, John, you are the king of 8.4 in the products, you want to kind of tell us a little bit about 8.4, which is on the street today?","John Curtiss","Yes, we\u2019re feeling really good about our model results in both 8.3 and 8.4. In terms -- our loss ratios are looking really good. We\u2019re happy with the mix of business we\u2019re writing, and we are finding ways to develop our models quickly and get them deployed more quickly. So getting new segmentation to market has been a big initiative for us. And I think it\u2019s something that we\u2019re doing really well today.","Tricia Griffith","Leanne, can you please introduce our first participant from the conference call line?","Operator","Your first question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question was just looking at your recent margins, so in June was the first time that you saw sequential improvement, meaning June versus May, in over 10 years and also the year-over-year improvement in your underlying loss.. [Technical Difficulty]","Tricia Griffith","Elyse, we lost you after the year-over-year improvement.","Elyse Greenspan","I\u2019m sorry. Yes, so the question was just tying back, you saw pretty strong year-over-year improvement in the underlying loss ratio, strongest of any month this year in June. Just about to get a little bit more color there, is it favorable loss trends, and how\u2019s the seasoning of the business that you wrote last year coming on?","Tricia Griffith","It\u2019s definitely we\u2019re changing our mix. So that is something that we\u2019ve noticed and will continue, we believe as we write more and more preferred business. We also have some underwriting in terms of making sure that we get the right rate for each of our customers. Frequency, I talked about frequency during my presentation and that it has actually risen in the most recent timeframe. We\u2019ve actually seen a little bit of a decrease in frequency in the last couple of quarters. And so we believe that is part of the reason for our expanded margins as well.","Elyse Greenspan","And then in terms of a couple questions on the homeowner\u2019s side. You provided on the slide that obviously shows, you guys have pretty low share at this time. Is there a market share goal as you expand on the homeowner side that you guys have in mind? And just secondly, tied to the homeowner side, if you can just give us an update on your property catastrophe reinsurance coverage and if there were any significant changes made this year versus last year?","Tricia Griffith","Yes, and I\u2019ll ask Trevor to come up a little bit to talk more deeply about the reinsurance side. So we want to do the same thing in home as we do in auto, grow as fast as we can with our target margin. So the first thing we had to do was get our sales force intact. So I talked about that about a year ago that we were aligning our sales force from ASI and Progressive to make sure we service those agents that have both home and auto, or monoline auto. And that has been resolved, it\u2019s really got a great momentum so we\u2019re excited about that. The other part was really expanding into many states. So we\u2019re in 41 states now with ASI or Progressive Home, and we\u2019ll continue obviously to have more offering in that -- in many states and with many more agents. So our goal is to again, grow as fast as we can on the home side, as long as we make our target margins. We obviously want to have that bundle customer because we know they last longer. And that\u2019s really important to us. And we\u2019re excited and we work hand-in-glove with the product folks at ASI to make sure that we have the right products on the street as well as the right rate for the individual risks that we see. In terms of reinsurance, we did change \u2013 or added to, I should say, our reinsurance plan in 2017 with our aggregate stop-loss agreement. And that is really $200 million worth of coverage, when our loss plus LE on a accident year ratio goes over 63 and that doesn\u2019t include liability or name storm. So that is something that is working as planned this year so far with our CATs. Trevor, you want to come up and talk a little bit more about the reinsurance plan?","Trevor Hillier","Yes. So catastrophe program that we have outside of the aggregate stop-loss is very similar to previous years. We\u2019ve always liked to buy a program that can protect us for at least two one-in-a-hundred-year events in a given year, and this year is no different. We have multi-event structure, providing the coverage isn\u2019t exhausted in the first couple of events. We actually have coverage beyond just the first two. So our property CAT coverage is very similar to how it\u2019s been in years past.","Julia Hornack","Thanks, Trevor. Leanne, I\u2019m going to take a question now from the webcast. Given the continued contribution growth from homeowners, which presumably operates with a lower target combined ratio, will the company gradually move towards accepting a higher level of target combined ratio within the residual personal auto book?","Tricia Griffith","We\u2019ve been very clear about both our calendar year combined ratio goals as well as our lifetime combined ratio goals of 96. So we look at all of our products as an amalgam of how we want to be priced. So we will try to write as much business as we can. And we will write at -- not one is necessarily 96, we\u2019ll write at different coverages as long as we are writing at or below our targets that we know to reach our goals. So obviously, we don\u2019t make those public, but we will try to get the more preferred bundle long-term customers. But again, we won\u2019t do that if we compromise our target margins.","Leanne, can we take the next caller from the conference line please.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.","Brian Meredith","A couple of questions here. First, just quickly on the commercial auto side. What is loss trend looking like there? You mentioned that you still have about 9% rate to come through. Is that well in excess of where trend is going right now?","Tricia Griffith","Loss rate has been favorable. Again that\u2019s a much more volatile coverage. And so as we saw last year, especially in the summer, that can be more volatile. So we believe we have the right amount of rates still to earn in, but we\u2019re feeling good about the margins that we have now. And again, we like that because it really is more of a volatile business. But we feel good about our position right now.","Brian Meredith","Right. So does that mean that there could be more margin expansion to come?","Tricia Griffith","I can\u2019t predict the future. And again it\u2019s a volatile business. We think we have the right rates earning in and of course that earns in a little bit slower than our auto book because it\u2019s a yearly basis. But we feel good. Again, we\u2019re always cautious because it is more of a volatile business.","Brian Meredith","Got you. And then wondering if you can just explain a little bit the severity that you\u2019re seeing on the auto property damage. And I know you mentioned it\u2019s because of claims clovers in the inventory and the pace. What\u2019s happening there that causes that increased severity? And does it also have an impact on your loss ratios? Or is it just a paid number?","Tricia Griffith","It has an impact, we\u2019re just seeing severity go up. And we believe overall, and then Gary I can have you come up and give some deeper insights because you study this on a daily basis. But yes, we\u2019re seeing severity on the property damage side. And we do believe it is because of higher cost in terms of the technology in vehicles. And we continue to watch that. And especially the fleet is different than our average fleet has been historically as well. Do you want to mention anything on severity, specifically?","Brian Meredith","[Indiscernible] but it popped up in the second, in the first half it\u2019s popped up a fair amount. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking.","Gary Traicoff","This is Gary Traicoff, Chief Actuary. To your point, in the first half of the year, PD severity is up about 6% to 6.5%, and on a trailing 12-month basis, were more around a 5%. To Tricia\u2019s point, we are seeing an increase with the technology, and on an accident year basis, we\u2019re probably closer to that 4% to 5%. The reason it booked up a little bit more, is we had a little bit of backlog on some closures related to what we would call inbound segregation. And those claims tend to settle at a little bit higher amount. So probably 1 point to 1.5 points is because of that closure catch-up. And we would say the long term rate is probably more around a 4% to 5%.","Tricia Griffith","Leanne, can we take another call from the conference call line please?","Operator","Your next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","I have one big question and one small one. I guess, Tricia, when we look at the market share numbers that you have, and here I\u2019m thinking mostly of the non-auto lines, is the target there for Progressive to be the underwriter of the complement of your market share? Or would you be comfortable serving that through Progressive\u2019s Agency -- I\u2019m sorry, the Progressive Advantage Agency?","Tricia Griffith","We\u2019re -- it depends, is the answer. So there is a big opportunity in those charts I showed in the Commercial Lines area. So John Barbagallo and I talk frequently about what\u2019s the right thing to do for Progressive and our customers. And the odds are we\u2019ll do a little bit of both. But when we feel like it can benefit and help with retention for our commercial auto customers, we won\u2019t necessarily have to underwrite it. So we might do things differently, maybe not unlike we did on the auto side. So on the auto side, we have ASI and our agency brand and it\u2019s the only home product we write and we underwrite that. And on our Direct Side we have 9 or 10 brands that we work with. The majority of them are unaffiliated and then we have under -- ASI as one of them. We will likely do the same and have been doing a little bit of that on the commercial side. So think of it almost as the commercial destination. So what makes most sense for us on the long term and when we feel like it\u2019s more important for us to underwrite it, we absolutely will. But we also are very intrigued with working with more and more partners.","Meyer Shields","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then a question for John if I can. I\u2019m just curious about whether the people that are likely to be the earliest adopters of more capable cars, is their current accident propensity different from the driving population at large?","John Curtiss","That\u2019s a really good question. And at this point we don\u2019t have enough data to distill what\u2019s being driven by the technology versus the people that are electing to drive those cars. So I think as we get more data and we try to control for all the various variables that we have in our products, we\u2019ll have a good insight into that. But I think it\u2019s a great question. But we have not been able to fully answer that, but it\u2019s something that we need to continue to think about.","Julia Hornack","All right. We\u2019re going to take another question from the webcast. This next one is, year-to-date results have been very favorable relative to the 96 target and growth has been great. Do you have any desire to lower pricing and\/or increase marketing spend dramatically to get back to a 96?","Tricia Griffith","We have been increasing our marketing spend. We want to do that carefully because we want to make sure a couple of things. One, is it incremental? So when you increase marketing, you don\u2019t want to just increase it to increase, you want to have incremental sales. So, we look very closely at that when we increase our marketing spend. We have -- we did that in first quarter, we continue to increase our marketing spend in the second quarter. And we will continue that if we believe that it will produce incremental sales. And we look at that from, we have an acquisition cost we want for each customer, and as long as that cost per sale is lower than acquisition cost, and it\u2019s incremental, we will increase our marketing, again as long as we\u2019re under that 96. And we look for prices, we look at pricing across states, across DMA, et cetera and we lower prices when we believe it will bring in business and it follows the trend.","Julia Hornack","Leanne, can you take the next caller please?","Operator","Your next question is from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan","First question is when you\u2019re talking about these trends, do you see a difference between the 2 main channel, like independent agency as well as through your direct channel?","Tricia Griffith","Yes, Kai, we see -- it would be in the aggregate level, we see differences between state mix, channel mix, customer mix. And that\u2019s how we really figure out how to set our targets for both new and renewal. So yes, we see differences.","John Curtiss","Was the question around technology trends or...","Kai Pan","Yes, more on the technology side.","Tricia Griffith","Okay, got it. You know how to answer that?","John Curtiss","I do not. I would say that the mix of the vehicles equipped with these technologies, as I said, is relatively small and it\u2019s starting to ramp up. So I do not know off the top of my head whether what we see in terms of differences between underwriting these vehicles by channel, that is not something we have spent a lot of time with yet.","Tricia Griffith","Well, remember and John said this, the amount of vehicles with this technology in the fleet is a very, very small percentage. So we watch this closely but you want to have enough data to be able to really understand it. And so we follow that data all the time. And as soon as we can correlate that with loss costs, we\u2019ll be able to do that in both the channels and really every segment. But it\u2019s still a pretty small part of the fleet.","Kai Pan","Great. And my follow-up question is about your sort of relationship with some of your partners, in terms of technology companies, or rather sort of like a shared mobility companies, do you feel them as long-term as a partner or as a competitor? Because some of them, especially car manufacturers as you said they might be collecting data themselves. I don\u2019t know in the future how do you see Progressive positioned?","Tricia Griffith","I\u2019ll let you add to that with what \u2013 with the relationships you have, but I\u2019ll start with the answer. Kai, we see these as partnerships. And some might be long term, some might be short term. But we\u2019re working really well with a lot of the OEMs. And obviously the shared mobility. Just to understand the loss behavior, and it\u2019s very different from an Uber driver to getting the data from OnStar. ","So that to us is just something that we\u2019ll continue to invest in. We know insurance and we know segmentation and we know pricing. And that is really something that we\u2019ve had as part of our signature talent for 80 years. And so we really bring a lot to the table for all the partners as they do with us. So we see that we\u2019ll continue to form more partnerships and more relationships as the technology continues to evolve.","Julia Hornack","I think that\u2019s a good answer. John, do you have anything else to add?","John Curtiss","I think that\u2019s good.","Julia Hornack","Leanne, we\u2019ll take the next caller from the conference line please.","Operator","Your next question is from [Josh Smith with TIA]. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","My question is in regards to the long-standing 96 goal. Over the years you\u2019ve had many changes, you\u2019ve gone through an industry period where investment returns have gone down. You\u2019ve had talk of tax reform, which can move taxes. You\u2019ve had a massive product shift moving into more commercial lines and homeowners. And yet still we\u2019re with the 96. I\u2019m just wondering why are we still beholden to that number, what\u2019s the magic in the 96? Because where I look at it, you\u2019ve had tremendous growth this year coming in -- growth in EPS per share, earnings per share, and the stock has reacted very favorably. And it\u2019s just more bang for the buck from having a lower combined versus higher growth. So I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit to that.","Tricia Griffith","You\u2019d have the perfect formula if you knew exactly where things would fall. If you had a crystal ball it might be differently. This is really something that is part of Progressive\u2019s culture. And so where there\u2019s no specific magic to a 96, it has been part of our objective for as long as I can remember from when Peter was CEO all the way through Glenn, and I don\u2019t intend to change it. Partly it\u2019s a discipline that we have to make sure that we stay true to our commitment to our owners, so we\u2019re going to make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit. And if we want to make more that\u2019s great, if we can make more where it\u2019s in the system. But we also want to grow, so it\u2019s always that balance. So for me if we wrote at a 94, but weren\u2019t able to grow as much or vice versa, that would be different. That\u2019s kind of the constant that we use to sort of anchor all of the other things that we do. And it really is something that everyone here understands and we\u2019re committed to. And it\u2019s part of really how we think about the opportunity. Obviously during times now where frequency is lower and\/or changing mix, we were able to make at least $0.04 or more. I remember that is the actual objective is to make at least $0.04. So we\u2019re okay with making more but we don\u2019t want to limit our growth. Did you want to add anything on that?","John Sauerland","I\u2019d just offer that it is about that discipline, for sure, but it has also resulted in really impressive ROEs over a really long time period. And yes, certainly interest rate environments change over time, and we haven\u2019t changed that underwriting margin. But I think the formula\u2019s worked really well in terms of pretty consistent performance in terms of ROE, and also ensured that we have had adequate capital to continue to grow. When you\u2019re growing at a $3 billion clip and you\u2019re pricing leased auto to sort of a three-to-one premium to surplus rate, then you need pretty adequate incremental capital for subsequent years, so it\u2019s been a formula that\u2019s worked really, really well. And as Tricia said, there\u2019s no intent to change it.","Operator","Your next question is from [Connie Debover with Boston and Company]. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Just going back to one of the slides where you pointed out the combined ratio gap continued to widen between you and your industry peers, how much of that is driven by the fact that you were ahead in terms of your pricing expectations versus peers versus the management actions, whether it be on the underwriting\/pricing side or points.","Tricia Griffith","Great question, I think it\u2019s a little bit of everything. But we have talked for years about always trying to get ahead of trend. And we refer to it as small bites of the apple, just making sure we have the right increase on the streets because we know when you have to raise rates quickly to get profitable, that causes shopping, and it\u2019s happened to us. But last year was a perfect example of us getting ahead of it. We raised rates because we had to, but we didn\u2019t have to raise them at the same rate that our competition. And that\u2019s where you start to get a lot of shopping behavior and if you\u2019re positioned well, you\u2019re able to grow and grow profitably.","We also do have a different model and going back to Josh\u2019s question in terms of that 96, we do want to make a bottom line underwriting profit and that\u2019s important to us as part of our objectives. And if you look across the industry, even with 2016 statutory results, you\u2019ll see that companies were able to grow, some companies were able to make money, but very few, Progressive being one of them, were able to grow and grow profitably. And so that part I think is really important because we always intend to be able to have that combined ratio under 96. So I think we look at our expense ratio, our cost structure\u2019s really important both on the expense ratio side as well as the loss adjustment side. So we want to continue to look at ways to be more efficient to be able to keep our rates competitive and grow.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And then my second question is if you can just remind me, excuse my ignorance. When you talk about the target margin for the homeowner side, what is the target?","Tricia Griffith","We actually don\u2019t publicize our specific target margins per product. So like we said, it\u2019s an amalgam, our 96 is an amalgam of every product, every state, every mix and then of course we have different targets for new and renewal business, based on the fact that we have acquisition costs that are different in each channel.","John Sauerland","And we will vary those targets by product set over time, given what we think the market opportunity is. But again going into every year, we\u2019re projecting our growth formula renewal by product and ensuring that, we believe at least, we\u2019ll be hitting that calendar year 96 in the coming year.","Julia Hornack","I\u2019m going to take another question from the webcast. When you say the severity of claims has gone up long-term, how does that break out in terms of injury, medical versus the auto repair? Could we get more color on how these subcomponents drive severity? And I have a feeling I\u2019m going to be stepping aside for Gary.","Tricia Griffith","That\u2019s a complicated question. Gary, if you want to talk about long-term trends you\u2019ve seen from severity, that would be great. So a deeper dive into what I gave in terms of medical trends.","Gary Traicoff","Sure. So Gary Traicoff again. In terms of, let\u2019s say short-term, like in the last year or so, both injury and property severity have been very similar, both around that 4% to 5% range. Medical, depending on the state, some have been a little bit more than that and some a little bit less. Over the long term, if we\u2019re talking more over 10, 20, 30 years, I think some of the stuff John showed, where trends are going up around there. Property for the most part has been more consistent. You\u2019ll generally see a little bit more volatility on the injury side. I think part of that comes into play when we have claims handling situations, et cetera. We know that medical costs are going up. But we don\u2019t necessarily see our trends mirror exactly where we see medical inflation at the same level.","Tricia Griffith","And in this year and this quarter and year-to-date, one of the drivers of our severity has also been Michigan Peb.","Gary Traicoff","That\u2019s correct.","Tricia Griffith","That\u2019s been a bigger driver on that. Which is -- there\u2019s a lot of volatility in there just because of the nuances of Michigan.","Julia Hornack","Leanne, we\u2019ll take a caller from the conference call line, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney.","Bob Glasspiegel","I got a capital question here, debt to capital is at 27.3. It went up with the bond issue and so then came down with the retirement. And remind me where you want to be there, and where you want to be on a premiums to surplus basis and what your sort of excess capital position is today?","Tricia Griffith","So we want to be less than 30% debt to capital, so we knew that would go up when we issued the $850 million bond, but we also knew the timing of -- to pay off the 6.7% bond that we had, the hybrid bond, so we knew that would pop up, we wanted to be less than 30%. From a capital perspective -- or you said premium surplus, premium surplus, 3:1 on Auto and about half of that amount for Home. On a capital basis, John alluded to this a little bit, but we have been really trying to use our capital to make sure that we continue to capitalize on our ability to grow in this environment. So the last 3 years, we\u2019ve really focused on making sure that we grow the business and that\u2019s our usage of capital. As we\u2019ve stated in the past, any under leverage capital we would use buy back shares or have a special dividend. Right now, we feel that we\u2019re putting our shareholders\u2019 money to the best use and that is growing the long-term business. So we\u2019re excited about that.","Bob Glasspiegel","So I thought that a special dividend was unlikely for 2 years, post the Homeowners acquisition. We\u2019re sort of through that period. But the special dividend would not be likely just because you think there\u2019s better opportunities to grow the business, is that what you\u2019re saying?","Tricia Griffith","At this point in time, we are focusing on using our capital to grow the business. And obviously, you know we have a variable dividend that year-to-date is fairly robust and it syncs up with our internal gain share program. And so we believe that shareholders, if it continues, will be very happy with that variable dividend. And right now, we believe we have the ability to continue to grow properly and that\u2019s the best use of our capital.","Julia Hornack","I\u2019m going to take another question from the webcast. Does Progressive have a view on the ability\/cost of retrofitting cars for safety-enhancing technologies such as auto braking or lane departure warning? Might the growth of retrofitting cars currently on the road change the pace at which these technologies penetrate the fleet and accelerate the downward trend of claims? And finally might Progressive or insurers encourage retrofitting via premium cost reductions? So we\u2019re really talking about accelerating penetration rates potentially.","Tricia Griffith","I think that\u2019s really more of an answer to consumers. We have not seen many consumers take that option. And so for us, we will rate according to loss costs. We\u2019re a cost based business. And so for us that\u2019s an easy answer. We have not seen very rapid penetration for most consumers. And I think John sort of alluded to that when he talked about there\u2019s a very big difference in having a $10,000 package when you already have a luxury vehicle, versus the majority of the population who might already have a 5, 6, 7-year loan on their car are not necessarily going to purchase that. And you haven\u2019t seen much movement in that, have you?","John Curtiss","We have not seen a lot of movement in aftermarket. It\u2019s probably more viable when we\u2019re trying to give warnings to the driver. When you start trying to do an aftermarket solution where you\u2019re trying to be able to operate the vehicle, to accelerate it or brake it. I think that what we\u2019re seeing is those types of aftermarket solutions will be held to the same standards, the same safety standards that the government is going to require for newer models. So from that perspective we have not seen a lot of movement there, and that\u2019s not something we\u2019ve been talking about offering to consumers.","Tricia Griffith","Not at this juncture.","Julia Hornack","All right. I\u2019ll take another question from the webcast. [Operator Instructions] The question is, can you give more details on Paths to Partnership commission program? How much more commissions do agents get and how is the annual bonus structured?","Tricia Griffith","I don\u2019t have all the specific details, but basically how we look at it is more of a zero sum game in terms of the commission we\u2019ve been paying overall. But we\u2019re giving higher commission to those agents who want to put their longer-retaining preferred business with us. And you have an option as well if you don\u2019t have a lot of customers but you want to work with Progressive, you have an option to have enough growth in those segments to get into the different levels of Paths to Partnership. We\u2019ll give you some details on that, likely in a future meeting, but it\u2019s pretty structured in terms of how much you write and the bonuses kind of fall into that, not unlike the Platinum Program.","John Sauerland","And if the follow-on question is about overall impact on cost structure, I would expect it to be, obviously self-fulfilling, the more successful it is the higher commissions we\u2019ll pay, but in the near term it would have a very small impact on our expense ratio. And at the same time we\u2019ve been working to reduce our non-acquisition expense ratio which excludes both commission as well as advertising costs. So net, I think we would expect our expense ratio to continue to be extremely competitive in the marketplace even with this enhanced commission program.","Tricia Griffith","And we just started rolling this out and it\u2019ll take throughout this year to continue to roll it out to all of our agents.","Julia Hornack","Another one from the webcast. Can you please comment on competition versus mutual insurers? They have a lower profit goal, it seems, and often write at an underwriting loss. As interest rates increase and net investment income improves do you believe they\u2019ll get more competitive? And finally -- I\u2019ll let you do that first and then I\u2019ll ask the follow up.","Tricia Griffith","I mean I think obviously everybody has their own operating objectives. And so we really try to surgically focus on our objective to grow as fast as we can at a 96 as long as we can serve our customers. And so we\u2019re obviously a little bit more conservative on the investment side because we want to make sure that we take care of our customers on the underwriting side. And that\u2019s worked for us. It\u2019s worked for us for a long time frame. And although some of our competition fall through in the mutual company, how they decide to operate is really in a very different structure. So we tried to focus really surgically on how to best profitably grow Progressive.","Julia Hornack","I lost my question, sorry. Finally, and you may have answered that, how much of an expense ratio and pricing advantage does Progressive need to have versus mutual insurers to remain competitive?","Tricia Griffith","I mean for us, we always try to figure out ways to be more efficient, period. And we look at that on the expense ratio that John just talked about, less advertising costs and commission cost, and so we look at what we call non-acquisition expense ratio, so think a lot of the call centers where we sell and service, and we always try to figure out how can we be more efficient, how can we continue to serve the customers. We monitor why customers are calling in. Can we be more communicative so they get the answers they want to? On the Claims side, loss adjustment expense is hugely important and we have in the past 10 years continued to decline in LAE based on becoming more and more efficient. And Mike Sieger and his team continue to look at ways to become more efficient in the claims organization. So both of those things are really important. We believe the key to the companies that grow and grow profitably and are able to do both have a competitive cost structure, because then you can take that cost structure and have it into your competitive prices and naturally, those are really the players that win on a long-term basis.","John Sauerland","To that I would offer that cost structure and expected margin is one component of the whole. Certainly brand and experience, when, where and how customers want to work with their insurance company, matter a lot as well. So yes, the price which is driven by everything you mentioned is important, but that\u2019s a part of the formula and we think our brand and experience are pretty powerful in the marketplace and are a big part of the formula as well.","Tricia Griffith","And what I talked about during my portion of the presentation, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to invest. So we see those as being mutually exclusive. To not being -- so to us, it\u2019s really about you have to be making investments in the future as well, and we understand that. And we think we have a really good balance there.","Julia Hornack","I have one more question from the webcast. The question is, I\u2019m going to reword it a little bit because I\u2019ve had a moment to think about it. So the question is, where are you in penetration of preferred agents for homeowners, number today, opportunity over the next three years? I think what they are really getting at is the appointment of Platinum agents, how many we\u2019ve actually appointed compared to maybe the potential number of preferred agents out in the market.","Tricia Griffith","We have about 2,000 Platinum agents. And think of our overall independent agent channel, we have about 35,000. So we continue to grow as we broadened our coverage across the country. Remember, our Platinum agents, we want to be number one or number two when they think of the preferred customers that come into their shop. So not every one of our independent agents necessarily have customers that have a home to insure. So that limits it. We\u2019ve also very specifically rolled out the Platinum model, more of a scarcity model to have it with fewer agents, because it is more complicated and it is something that is special to have, both those Auto and Home product. We also have what we call PHA Agents, Progressive Home Advantage agents, so they\u2019re not necessarily Platinum but they have our ASI Home product as well. It continues to grow. And I think that\u2019s the most exciting part when I think about the Destination Era and I think about that over $300 billion opportunity on the personal lines side, we\u2019ve really just touched the surface with Progressive and ASI in terms of Home. And so those are where we really made the big investments that I talked about, on the commission schedule, acquisition of ASI, our in-house agency as well as our HomeQuote Explorer. So we feel like this is like the precipice of really gaining more and more market share in homeowners. And with that we will absolutely be appointing many more agents.","Julia Hornack","And along those same lines, actually from the webcast, we have a question about the Robinsons. A lot of Robinsons are with insurers in the captive agency channel, namely State Farm and Allstate. Is there a differentiated strategy to go after that sub-segment versus the independent agency channel Robinsons?","Tricia Griffith","I talked about the $91 billion opportunity in that home market and $63 billion of it being in places where we already have access, so direct to NAI. That\u2019s not to say we don\u2019t get plenty of people that shop from the captive agencies. And that\u2019s really one of the reasons why we did invest in this. So while we don\u2019t necessarily go out to those people particularly, we believe because of our brand and because we are available where, when and how people want to shop, we will ultimately get a lot of customers from the captive agency as well. So while it\u2019s not a strategy, we want every customer we can. And we believe they\u2019ll be shopping because we\u2019ve made it easier.","John Sauerland","And I would add, in this environment where rates and some lines have been inadequate and preferred companies are raising rates fairly aggressively, we\u2019re seeing more preferred shoppers coming into marketplace across channels. So captive IAs as well as direct.","Julia Hornack","Great. Well, that would appear to have been our final question. So we look forward to seeing you all in November. And that concludes our event today. I\u2019m going to hand it back over to Leanne for the closing scripts.","Operator","That concludes the Progressive Corporation\u2019s Second Quarter Investor Event.

Thank you, Brian and welcome to our Third Quarter Investor Event. Today we will begin with an update on our efforts to penetrate the home auto bundle market. Our presentation will last approximately 40 minutes and will be followed by a Q&A session with our CEO, Tricia Griffith; our CFO, John Sauerland; and our guest speaker today, Heather Day, Preferred Marketing Process Leader. For Q&A, Bill Cody, our Chief Investment Officer will join us by phone.","As always discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during the event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the investors page of our website, progressive.com.","And with that it's my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith.","Tricia Griffith","Good morning, and welcome to Progressive's Third Quarter Webcast. Before we get started at the topic at hand, I wanted to reflect a little bit about the last quarter, specifically with Harvey and Irma, two names I think all of us are very familiar with based on this very, very active hurricane season.","As you know from my letter, several of us went down to both Florida and Texas just to get some insights into how our employees are doing, do they have the right resources to help our customers and get some insights into our customers and what they need from us.","This year, at this CAT season, we took down one of our internal videographers just to capture some of the moments and really to have everyone at the company understand not only what happens in a CAT but how we react, which is so important and so critical to our customers.","So we captured this a couple of minute video, mostly internally because although we had our CAT team available in both of those states and almost 1,300 reservists from around the country, not everybody at Progressive gets the insight of how we really handle CATs and to us, that is really something we find very important, both for our employees and customers.","So I'd like to share that around two-minute video with you for you to get some insight into our culture and the importance of making sure we take care of our customers in their greatest time of need.","[Presentation]","As always, I'm very impressed with our response, both on the Progressive and the ASI side. And we know customers want us to be out there quickly, and we're known for our speed and that's why we take so much time to really understand all the customers, all what they need during a catastrophe. And more importantly, they want to make sure that they are taken care of and that their claims are resolved quickly and accurately. And as you can tell from our closure rate, and a very impressive closure rate, we were able to do that.","When we take care of our customers during this time of need, they end up rewarding us with staying and we are starting to see that with our retention results. So again, I am so proud of all the employees at both ASI and Progressive of how they have handled both those of these and I know whatever is to come, we will be able to handle that in an exemplary fashion.","Let's get to the topic at hand. So last time we met, we talked about the addressable market and specifically the first component, the private passenger auto section of the personal lines market. We talked about the fact that there's a $215 billion opportunity, of which we have less than 10%. And when John Curtiss outlined what we call our runway project, we talked about the fleet size as well as frequency and severity trends and how that really excited us to understand the opportunity in the auto market.","So we're not going to talk a lot about that today, but we're thrilled with our opportunity in the auto platform in terms of our product, our service on both the claims and CRM side, our retention and our brand. So putting all those components together, we feel very positive that we have a lot of opportunity on the auto side.","Today our focus is going to be on the over $90 billion opportunity on the property side, the homeowner side, and that will really be the deep dive that Heather goes into. Again, we think having that bundle is really important, but that property piece and especially our relationship with ASI, continues to evolve, and that's what we're really excited about.","So really the spoiler alert for the rest of the 30 minutes that we're going to talk is that we continue to be extraordinarily pleased with our acquisition of ASI. We originally went in with the acquisition to be able to get access to the preferred customers on the agency side. But as it has evolved, and we are working hand in glove with ASI, it has proven to be positive on both the agency side and the direct side. So Heather Day, our preferred marketing leader is going to come up and talk about what we've done to-date, the momentum we're building and how we're going to capitalize and capture more of that preferred customer.","But before that, John Sauerland, our CFO is going to talk about the size of the opportunity, why we continue to be very pleased with the acquisition of ASI and how we structure our reinsurance in order to mitigate risk. And as you can see from the first quarter, that served us well with Irma. And then the three of us will come up for any questions you may have.","So let's get started. John?","John Sauerland","Thank you, Tricia. Good morning, everyone. The size of the opportunity for Progressive in the personal line space remains very large. We're very excited by the fact that we can now attract and retain virtually all personal lines customers, executing on our destination strategy.","Most of you are familiar with how we segment the personal line space, but for those of you who aren't, let me spend a minute to review. We have four primary segments within personal lines, those are represented by the personas of Sam, Diane, the Wrights and the Robinsons. Sam isn't consistently insured, you can think of Sam on the nonstandard end of the spectrum. Diane, a renter, who is more consistent with her insurance consumption. The Wrights, homeowners, who don't bundle home and auto, and the Robinsons, who bundle home and auto.","You can see on this slide, we've delineated the personalized market space across those four segments as well as the primary distribution channels in which they currently consume their insurance. As you can see, the Robinsons are over half of the personal lines marketplace. We've had some success penetrating the Robinsons segment, our growth year-on-year in terms of policies in force for households is 30%. We think we now have slightly less than 2% of Robinsons countrywide or around 0.75 million households.","The predominance of the Robinsons in our current customer set, we have developed or as we say graduated. Meaning they started as a Sam, a Diane, or a Wright, and we have evolved them through their life to be a Robinson, bundling home and auto. Now today the new business, the new Robinsons coming into Progressive are a little more equal, 50-50, and that's driven predominantly by independent agents who are moving existing Robinsons to Progressive, but by and large our book is still made up of customers that we've graduated into that segment.","I thought a real life example would be great to give you a perspective on how this journey evolves and the financial gains that this strategy brings. When I was Personal Lines President, thank you cards would go out to our customers under our name. On occasion I would get a response and I saved one because I thought it was a great example of a customer who was in a state, very young, who we could be their insurer for life. If our strategy was working, we could be their insurer for life.","The customer's name is Adrian and the letter to me he sent to me is short enough that I will read it to you. \"My name is Adrian and I recently received a thank you card from you. I just wanted to write back and say that I really appreciated it, and the personal touch that Progressive puts on all that it does. I've had Progressive as my insurance provider since I purchased my first motorcycle as a teenager. Now 'all grown up' as they say, Progressive protects my car and their affiliates protect my apartment. I come from a marketing background so I understand the challenges involved with a big company trying to convey a personal touch. So again, I just wanted to let you know I appreciate it.\"","Adrian was 25 years old when he sent me that letter in 2012. I looked into Adrian's situation with Progressive at that time, and Adrian did indeed purchase a motorcycle policy with us as his first policy with Progressive. Our records show he was actually 21 when he did so. He paid $142 for an annual motorcycle with Progressive, so less than $12 a month. What Adrian didn't share in his letter that he was that he was apparently living with his girlfriend Kathy at the time he sent the letter.","Kathy also had an auto insurance policy through Progressive separate from Adrian's, at the same address and apartment number. She was also listed on that renters policy. So Adrian was clearly starting to grow up and finding some stability in life. Perhaps not coincidentally, Adrian also sold his motorcycle just around the time he and Kathy moved in together.","Adrian and Kathy got married in 2013, so I've obviously follow through to see every couple of years where Adrian and Kathy stand. They have moved from one state to another, back to their original state. They have had multiple different vehicles, from a Ford Focus to a Lexus. And just in September this year, they purchased a home, went down to one vehicle and they insured that home through Progressive Advantage Agency, our in-house agency.","The key perspective I wanted to bring here is that while Adrian started with us with a policy that cost him less than $12 a month, he and Kathy have now sent Progressive and our affiliates almost $20,000 cumulatively in premium over the past decade. If we didn't have renters insurance, would we have lost Adrian and Kathy at that point? If we didn't offer homeowners insurance, would we have lost them just a couple of months ago? My expectation is yes. We now have the products to keep Adrian and Kathy for life.","My hope is that the next time I check in on the household there is a new addition. Maybe they are considering life insurance, maybe they have even already purchased life insurance through Progressive. We can be Adrian and Kathy's insurance company for life for the next multiple decades and that means a ton of premium for Progressive. So I hope that gives you perspective on the strategy and the benefits. Adrian and Kathy are direct customers with us. We've had a lot of success with Robinsons in the direct channel.","What I'm sharing with you now is the share we believe we have within each distribution channel, here direct and independent agents. We think we have around 8.5% now of Robinsons who shop direct for their insurance. That's fantastic. We had 0, 10 years ago. We have had the luxury of working with multiple homeowners carriers, third parties, to meet the needs with our direct customers.","In the independent agent channel, we haven't had that same level of success. We have a little less than 2% of Robinsons today in the independent agent channel. If you recall an earlier slide, the Robinsons within independent agents is a more than $50 billion segment. Direct is a little more than $20 billion. While we had an affiliate relationship that we use to bundle home and auto within the independent agent channel a number of years ago, that relationship did not work out in that channel. That carrier remains a key part of our direct efforts but it didn't work out for independent agents.","We were very clear at that time that in order to penetrate that more than $50 billion segment, we needed a preferably monoline homeowner carrier focused on independent agents, one that had a great management team in place and one that was consistently profitable. I personally believed at that point in time, it might have been only one company that fit that bill and that was ASI.","Monoline home carrier expanding across the country, focused on independent agents, great leadership team and a track record of very consistent and very robust profitability, combined ratios that on their own are impressive and relative to the industry, even more impressive.","Now a key part of ASI strategy in terms of ensuring consistent profitability is a robust reinsurance program. We haven't talked a lot about that with you yet, so I'm going to take a little time on this slide to share the current aggregate stop-loss as well as named storm programs.","For named storms, the ASI tower for our first event that hit Florida is about $1.6 billion. Now models will tell you different things around what the probability of a storm of that size impacting ASI's book to that level, I think it reasonable to think of that top of that tower as a 1 in 300-year event. The layers in this tower are not shown, do drop down in case of exhaustion of the layers below them, and the majority of the lower portion of this tower is reinstatable.","Further, the reinstatement premiums on those layers are prepaid. So layers can drop-down and the majority of the lower layers here are reinstatable and the premium is prepaid. Retention, $50 million. As you know in September, Irma was more than $300 million incurred for our property business, we retained $50 million.","The second tower here for a Florida event assumes a $1 billion event for the first event. The FHCF Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund is not reinstatable, so that would be not available for a second event, even given that fact, we have $1.2 billion available in the event of a second event and our retention is $50 million. This tower would also be reflective of a first event in a non-Florida State.","There is yet coverage after the second event for a third event, and in this case we assume a $700 billion Florida event for the second event. You can see we have almost $700 million in coverage for that storm as well and we retained only $25 million in that case. Robust program for named storms.","As the company has expanded across the country, we've recognized a need for aggregate coverage. Hailstorms can be very expensive for home carriers. Previously, the company employed a cash rebound with a $175 million annual aggregate retention, with $200 million above that. Starting in 2017, we employed an aggregate stop-loss agreement that has $200 million of coverage above a 63 loss plus ALA ratio excluding named storms and excluding liability claims.","Today we have a little less than $100 million as recoverable on that ASL. That does not settle until year-end, so we will hopefully end up in a better place by year-end. But the point is the company has a very robust reinsurance program in place for both named storms and aggregate losses. We've gotten a question since we became a majority of ASI - majority owner in ASI, whether we will increase the retentions here. This kind of risk profile in terms of a reinsurance program is very similar to what the company had when we acquired them or the majority interest.","The short answer to that question is today there's no plan to do so. We have three reasons behind that. First, our commitment to our calendar year 96 or better. The second is that when we look at the return on capital in the reinsurance space, we see levels of return that are below P&C in general and materially below Progressive's performance. Thirdly, when we look at the reinsurance pricing today, while we don't contend to know if it's accurate or adequate, we do recognize that today the pricing is half or less than what it was just 10 years ago.","So it seems if we wanted to bring on more risk, retain more risk, this probably isn't the best time. Now we recognize that even with a robust reinsurance program, capital needs in property are higher than for auto. We've shared this perspective with you actually two years ago, when we acquired the majority interest. And this is simply to say even at premium to surplus levels, half of auto for property, if you target a lower combined ratio, you can hit great returns on capital, and that's what we do.","Now this begs the question, if you're going to target a lower return for - a lower combined ratio for property, will you lower that 96 calendar year target or will you raise the target for your other business lines? Response to that question, I first offer the fact that property today is 4% to 5% of our premium. I also point out that when we set combined ratio targets by business unit, we do so at the new and renewal business level, we do so on a lifetime basis, we do so considering the returns on capital by line, and our expectations around growth for the coming year.","What I'm sharing with you here is our current targets for our 5 major business units, as well as the standard deviation, plus or minus the standard deviation, one standard deviation range around that target. You can see all the targets are below the 96 and I will quickly admit that the deviation around the performance relative to the targets has a performance bias in it. We are consistently but not always below that target and that is intended. That is the construct that helps ensure that we are at or below that 96 calendar year every year.","Now I understand that return on capital here is not the same thing as saying that our return on the investment in ASI has been robust, but I will say that we are diligent in reviewing our assumptions around the acquisition and the price we pay.","So to-date, growth has been below our expectations, but I will quickly add to that, the growth to-date is far exceeding our expectations. The inception to date number is highly influenced by the fact that we lost a large client, early on, solely because Progressive took a majority interest. But as Heather will share with you in a moment, growth is robust, so we think we are getting the momentum in the growth here.","When we look at our combined ratio versus our assumptions, we're slightly higher. But recognizing the period we're looking at, we have had three storm seasons and the past two in terms of hail, have been based on our vehicle experience, some of the most active hail seasons we've ever seen. And of course, we've now had two named storms hit the continental United States in 2017. We're comparing that against less than a three-year premium period, again our combined ratio inception to date is not hitting the target. It is not that far off and we're confident in the underlying profitability of the business.","I hope you're getting the fact that we are very excited by the fact that we have ASI as part of our destination strategy now. Heather is going to share more about our momentum, but my hope is the next time I talk to you about Robinsons, I will share an Adrian and Kathy's story, along with one of our partner independent agents.","So with that, Heather Day.","Heather Day","Thank you, John. So as John highlighted, there is significant market opportunity for Progressive in the Robinsons segment. In 2014, we laid out our vision for the Destination Era and plans for growing that book of Robinsons. Subsequent investments in ASI, but also in processes and systems across channels, have laid the foundation for that growth.","In year-to-date, we are experiencing steadily increasing velocity in creating Robinson bundles. We are now accelerating away from the historical slope in both direct and agency channels, with about equal parts coming from our existing auto customers that are transitioning to bundled homeowners with us, and from new business Robinsons that are adding an - that are buying an agent - an auto policy as they bundle with us.","So property is considered an anchor product in the Destination Era and we have extended our core distribution strategy to include property. As with auto, property insurance is now available how, where and when customers to choose to interact with us and that requires thinking about property comprehensively. It has been woven into how we go to market and throughout our funnel, from our branded messaging, across all of our channels for purchasing and servicing a policy and through engagement with our existing auto customers as they become homeowners.","As part of that strategy, Progressive is well positioned to connect with the highest potential segment for home insurance shopping. The top graph here shows the overall U.S. population by age, the bottom graph shows the Progressive auto distribution by age. Merging the two, the orange line highlights Progressive's market share by age relative to the overall U.S. population.","Progressive has an advantage position with the younger population. And homebuyers skew younger. Overall, 62% are under the age of 44. Not surprisingly, the skew is even greater for first-time homebuyers. Looking at first-time homebuyers by age group, 80% are under the age of 44, peaking in the age range of 25 to 34, again, aligning nicely with Progressive's auto distribution.","And while these millennials are shopping for homes later than in prior generations, as they age further into adulthood, the trend to home buying continues. Now Progressive has a legacy of building demand, with strong response from younger customers. We seek to be first in wallet with auto insurance. But as we saw with John's story of Adrian, our customers are not static. They are constantly evolving in their needs. That first home purchase is a seminal event that fundamentally changes the insurance needs of our customers and it can prompt shopping.","So our investments reinforce our relationship up to that point and increase the likelihood that we will be first in line as an option for our customers during that critical transition. We are making steady gains in bundling these customers.","We're also able to leverage strong brand consideration in that younger population, which extends here to the Robinsons consumer segment. Here we see the Robinsons insurance consideration by age, with the solid blue line representing the top two box consideration for Progressive, and the solid orange line representing the top two box consideration for a large captive carrier. The dotted lines represent the same consideration levels for 2016. Again, Progressive's favorite position with younger markets comes through. These consumers have grown up with Progressive as an insurance brand.","To reinforce awareness and consideration of Progressive with these Robinsons, we are essentially extending the Progressive brand. Value and ease are core established brand attributes, and these carry over into home and bundling. However, we recognize that Robinsons are motivated not only by rate but also by peace of mind. We are able to tap into the power of the Progressive network of ads, leveraging familiar assets to layer on new messages around bundling and protection.","In an earlier ad, with a jar for bundle jokes, there was a simple message, bundle and save. This next ad was called \"Flo-tection\", in which Flo is ever present in her efforts to protect the family's home and auto, from a neighbor's barbecue to a pesky pigeon. In a recent ad, Flo and Jamie struggle to get into the Progressive labs to see the new HomeQuote Explorer, which echoes yet another brand attribute of comparison shopping. Finally, a set of ads that are funny twists on that moment of realization that one is actually grown up, or perhaps morphing into one's parents, and that owning a home changes everything.","There is an ecosystem of content that wraps around these ads and reinforces the messaging online, connecting with people dreaming about and researching homes. Home and bundle ads like the one that I just described are strong performers in our overall marketing line up. Looking at the ads from the last two years on a 2 x 2 matrix of ad effectiveness, ads featuring home and bundled messages here are highlighted in blue. And as we can see by the cluster of home ads up in the top right, ads with these messages generally outperform on two of our key measures.","The net is that we are able to effectively layer home and bundle messages onto existing assets and leverage that brand equity. The strong performance of these messages enables very efficient spending relative to what might normally be expected in generating response for new product line.","In line with that efficiency, we have increased mass media spending for homeowners and bundle messaging. And with a more fragmented homeowners market, that spend is echoed by increased share of voice, which reinforces awareness and consideration.","Now the power of our content carries into earned media online. Organic search results reflect the strength and relevance of our content and our measure of online authority. Progressive has held a leading position in organic search results during most of 2017 and all of the peak homeowners shopping season. Top placement translates into traffic, which brings us to the direct acquisition funnel. While the volume of online home quotes is still small relative to auto, Progressive has established an early lead.","Looking at online quotes submitted during the first half of 2017, Progressive is the clear number one. And those quotes are dropping into a new and improved funnel. As Tricia has noted in her 2017 quarterly updates, earlier this year we launched the HomeQuote Explorer. Based on initial results, we accelerated the rollout and the platform is now available countrywide on both desktop and mobile.","Building on our years of online expertise and tapping into publicly available data, the HomeQuote Explorer provides a simple and comprehensive home insurance quote experience. The enhanced platform also supports our in-house Progressive Advantage agency, so there's continuity between the online and phones experience. One of our in-house agents can pick up a customer's quote, consult over the phone and take it through to conclusion.","Now the HomeQuote Explorer is an important foundational element for growing share in the direct Robinsons market. Progressive serves a wide range of direct customers, and whereas progressive alone can offer an auto rate for just about every risk, homeowners carriers are more limited. By extending our multicarrier platform, we have become more efficient at matching our customer needs to an offer that works.","Now previously we've highlighted the improved acceptability we saw with the multicarrier platform over the phones, with acceptability as the percentage of time we can present a customer with a homeowner's rate, and we are now experiencing those same acceptability gains across our multicarrier channels, desktop, mobile and phones.","So as we look back at acceptability over the last 12 months, we see some month-to-month variability due to customer mix and carrier appetite, but a clear trend emerges after the HomeQuote Explorer elevates. Those acceptability improvements are combined with gains and conversions and other funnel enhancements, so that as we see a similar pattern of improved year-over-year yield.","So to summarize on the direct side, our message is resonating with the target segment. We've established an early lead in driving online quotes and the funnel is notably more efficient. However, even as we are enthusiastic about those direct successes, we know that most Robinsons continue to buy through agents. As John showed earlier, local agents write more than 85% of bundle business.","As the number one writer of auto insurance through the independent agent channel, we believe we are reasonably well positioned to leverage our strength to become the number one writer of auto and home insurance through the channel.","And in agency, we have an equally comprehensive approach to growth, partnering with agents ready to write bundles, providing them with a competitive offering, making it easy for them to do business and building confidence in our ability to serve the customers. So these elements come together in the Platinum program. It is the foundation for bundled growth in agency.","Progressive offers our auto and special lines products through a broad set of independent agents, over 35,000. This is not true for Progressive home. Only 12% of agents have access to the Progressive Home product, and just 5% are invited into the Platinum program.","Now the number of Progressive home and Platinum agents will expand to meet our growth objectives. In fact, we have almost doubled the number of Platinum agents over the last 12 months, but it will remain small relative to the overall agent footprint. Platinum in particular, will remain exclusive. It will be available only to those agents that have strong potential to write preferred bundled business and that demonstrate strong commitment to placing that business with Progressive and Platinum is working.","I'd like to revisit graph that Pat Callahan shared during last year's Investor Relations meeting. This graph compares two cohorts of agents, both of which were offering Progressive home at the start of 2015. One group was selected for Platinum and the other group remained in the non-Platinum standard Progressive home program. Now of course if we go back to the start of 2015, the more productive agents were ultimately invited to join the Platinum program, so we do see an initial delta. However, after the launch of Platinum, that gap widens.","Momentum was initially slow as we integrated the Progressive and ASI sales teams and built out the Platinum program infrastructure, but we're now seeing the multiplier effect of initiatives coming together. Looking at the solid orange line for Platinum agents versus the solid blue line for Progressive home agents, Platinum agents are now five times more likely to bundle home and auto.","And then if I add preferred auto growth, these are the dash lines, you'll notice that both sets of agents are increasing preferred auto volume over time, but Platinum agents are now three times more likely to write preferred auto for agency. The gaps between these Platinum and Progressive home lines on the graph, this is the Platinum difference, and that gap is continuing to widen.","Now, of course, there is more work ahead, and one of the advantages of the Platinum model is the opportunity for deeper engagement with our agents. As we seek to continuously improving our offering, listening to agents is key. So we know that a competitive bundle rate is just the starting point also essential is bundle alignment across our auto and home products.","Progressive and ASI teams, both product and sales, work closely to make good use of agent feedback on product features and underwriting. The deepening integration of these teams has enabled faster learning and speed-to-market on a range of enhancements, such as new underwriting guidelines for older homes, Platinum endorsement of premium coverages for the home product, and continued progress in preferred segmentation on auto.","That said, winning in the agent's office goes beyond product. Agents have long recognized Progressive for our ease-of-use and we are investing to extend that value proposition into bundling with the next generation quoting platform. Now despite the growing prominence of comparative raters, the efficiency of the proprietary portal remains a differentiator. About 75% of bundled quotes start on raters, but agents still bridge into multiple platforms to complete the quote and to compare final rates.","So once again, we have talked to agents extensively and we have piloted some of these bundled quote features. But we also took a step back to look beyond the industry. We've benchmarked against best-in-class consumer shopping experiences to streamline the quote and to make it easy to offer multiple products through an integrated interface and we are on schedule to start rolling out this enhanced experience in early 2018.","And of course, compensation matters. Enhanced compensation for bundled business remains a core element of Platinum, and we are also element - we are also implementing a unified bonus program that recognizes Platinum agents for the quality and volume of business they write with us across all lines of business.","Finally, there are elements that are hard to quantify, such as agent confidence in Progressive Home. And we recognize that takes time. We know ASI's record of excellent claims service even in the most trying circumstances, like following a catastrophe. But we need to build that same level of awareness and confidence with our agents. So these many elements come together and they form the base for deepening our relationship with Platinum agents.","In close, Robinsons are growing as a relative share of our overall book. Of course, this is an expansion strategy. It is not a replacement strategy. While Robinsons are growing as a share of the book, we have more Sams in force today than we did in 2014. Further, the expectation that Robinsons would result in extended policy life holds. Using our Sam policy life expectancy as a base, our Robinsons policy life is now over three and a half times greater.","And finally, we are growing Robinsons from a solid foundation, based on those same attributes that drives Progressive's overall success, weaving property into our culture and thinking, extending the brand, putting forward a competitive bundle offer and ultimately meeting the broader needs of our customers. This is the Destination Era in effect, and we are building from here.","And with that, we will take your questions if you give us just a minute to get set up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","A - Julia Hornack","[Operator Instructions] I'm going to start with a question that I've gotten frequently, which is how has the hard market contributed to the success of Platinum in the Agency channel?","Tricia Griffith","I'll start with that, and Heather, if you could elaborate a little bit, specifically with Platinum. Overall, the hard market is really about being in the consideration set, especially on the Agency side. So when we think of that, we think of course our brand, your trusted brand. We think of service, especially times like this when you have catastrophes agents get feedback on exemplary service and service that needs work, so make sure you always service your customers.","But more importantly, when the customers come in that agency, do you have the right product at the right price? And that's really the key to being successful in a hard market, to be able to have a great product and we are very happy with our [indiscernible] product at a very competitive rate. And to me, that's the overall picture of how you really win a hard market. Specific to Platinum, Heather, why don't you elaborate a little bit?","Heather Day","Yes, I think you're right. It is about being in the right position to take advantage of market opportunity. If I look back a couple of years, we would not have been in a position to grow, whether it is a hard or soft market. So it is really the work that has happened to reinforce our bundled product, to deepen those relationships with agents, that during this time where we've got the opportunity to grow, we're in a position with the right product, the right relationships at the right time.","Tricia Griffith","And the agents really do talk about that. So I do a lot of big agency events, and you can tell just that in the last year as we've come together, especially with the agent representatives that go in, the agents really respect and honor that relationship and you can tell it's adding to our results.","Julia Hornack","Thank you. So Brian, can we please take the first question from the telephone participants please?","Operator","Of course, our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi good morning. My first question, I guess, first as I think about the bundled customers versus non-bundled customers, do you assume a lower loss ratio on the bundled side, just because there generally have been more affluent customers or can you kind of just walk us through how you're kind of thinking through the margin profiles of the two different segments of the business?","Tricia Griffith","Yes. We do assume \u2013 we'd look at all of our customers with segmentation and subsegmentation. So generally, we believe that bundled customers will be more competitive and so we bake in, obviously, loss ratio-expense ratio differences in those customers and we know that they stay longer, which also influences that.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then something that's a bit more topical over the past has obviously been the prospects of tax reform. Given that you guys could be a pretty big beneficiary on the tax side, would you look to keep any potential benefit or do you think that, that - would that be passed through to potentially lower pricing?","Tricia Griffith","Yes well, the devil will be in the details. Generally speaking for Progressive, we believe that if it comes to a 20%, we don't know what the outcome will be, that we will benefit from that. I think what I'd like to do is to have John talk about how we look at that from an operational side and then Bill Cody is on the phone, and he can talk about how we've been looking at that from an investment side. We talk about this all the time, at least in the last year or so, and model out what those changes would be. So John, why don't you start on the operational side?","John Sauerland","Sure, obviously, a timely question. I'm sure most of you spent a lot yesterday reading a lot on potential tax code changes. Generally, it is our bias that we would allow benefits of tax change, federal tax change to fall to the bottom line. That said, we are - we would be considering the competitive environment in which we operate as we decide whether we would change that 96 target or not, our initial expectation is that we would not. We would also obviously try to understand the likelihood of permanence in any change.","But I also would like to note when it comes to taxes that we actually pay as much tax above the line in an average year as we do below the line, so to speak. So for insurance, we have a state premium tax, generally not a state income tax, and that state premium tax is about $0.5 billion for Progressive, and that's included in our expense ratio. We do a lot to try to optimize our premium tax rates, meaning multiple legal entities.","We work on getting tax credits as well. And more recently below the line for federal taxes, we have been working to be more proactive in managing our federal tax rate through the use of renewable energy credits. So generally, we will expect to allow it to fall to the bottom line unless the competitive environment changed a lot. And I think Bill would - can comment on the potential implications for our investment portfolio.","William Cody","Sure, Elyse. The biggest implication or the direct implication would be in the muni portfolio, which is now, let's say, 8.7% of our total portfolio, which is down about 2% from last year, the end of last year. So that comes to a little bit less than $2.4 billion. About $900 million of that or roughly 40% is in housing bonds which - most of which, we would still find attractive at a 20% tax rate. A similar amount we hold for premium tax abatement purposes, which is something that John had mentioned and I would say the vast majority of that would still be attractive at lower tax rates as well.","The balance, there are some special situations which will be also attractive. And then others that we would sell, given valuations and tax rates because we look at munis on a fully taxable equivalent basis compared to other products. And to the degree they're not competitive on that basis, we will sell them. We generally expect munis to do well under the proposed tax plan because individual demand should hold up pretty well, given the top tax rate remaining at the 39.6% and the elimination of state and local in the income tax deduction. And as well as the fact that we will see some supply-demand - supply drop, given the elimination of advanced refundings and private activity with bonds. ","Through the rest of the portfolio, corporate bonds should do better as cash flow is increased and leverage is reduced. We should also see some less issuance in that space as well. We also expect rates should move a bit higher on the boost to growth and some possible F1 series bonds [ph]. And we also think our equity portfolio should do well. Obviously, it's a big winner of reduced corporate taxes.","Elyse Greenspan","Thanks bill","Julia Hornack","Thanks Elyse. Brian, can we take the next question from the conference call line please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Mr. Glasspiegel your line is now open.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning, Progressive. A question on the - on how we should think about the option execution. Is there anything magical about getting into a 100%? I mean if things are like they are, do you anticipate that you're going to want to get to 100%?","John Sauerland","Yes, so Bob, I'll take that one. In April of 2018, we have the option to get to 80% or more and I expect we will take that option. We have the option to get to 100% at the end - or in April of 2021 and it is our expectation that we would take that option as well. The owners of those shares also have the option to put their shares to us at the same time at those two different dates. This is obviously intended to ensure that the key leadership team that I talked about remains to continue to build the business and be very engaged, which they continue to be.","On that note I will, however, mention that we have also recently had a senior person from Progressive join the ASI team. So Dave Pratt, who most previously ran our Snapshot business and has a long history, probably 27 years or so with Progressive, is now in direct report of John Auer, the CEO of ASI. So working to get further integration, but yes, we would expect that we would be at, at least 80% come April of '18, and get to 100% in '21.","Tricia Griffith","Sorry, Bob, I didn't know you were referring to ASI. I was like, options? We don't have that options anymore. Sorry.","Bob Glasspiegel","A question on where the sort of current run rate is in homeowners. If we sort of take out amortization and investment for growth and sort of unusual CATs, where should we think of this sort of current year-to-date run rate?","Tricia Griffith","You can talk a little bit more about that. I think taking out the amortization expense and the current CATs, we feel much more positively about the run rate. And of course, as we expand across the country, we learn more and more about - we have more development and we understand a little bit more of each state and the nuances. But we also believe that that's a great strategy because being across the country and not having so much concentration in the states we have now will actually be beneficial to us.","Bob Glasspiegel","So just to understand your answer, you are earning your targeted return underlying? Or you need more scale to get there?","John Sauerland","Yes, I can answer that, Bob. So as I mentioned, when we modeled the value of ASI, we obviously assumed a margin, operating margin and we are slightly above that inception-to-date. Actually, in 2017, if you take out that amortization, we're at a 101 year-to-date, and that is not where the model assumed we would be on an inception-to-date basis. But of course, homeowners is spikier, consequently the need for reinsurance, consequently need for greater capital levels. But on an inception-to-date basis, given the fact that we've had a high degree of hail as well as the named storms, we feel great. So we have a target combined ratio, as I showed you on that slide.","For the property business, it is well below 96, reflecting the additional need for capital. And we think our underlying profitability is solid. Homeowners is a line in which we have been taking rates up some. We expect to take those rates up more throughout the rest of the year and into 2018 as well. So we are seeing loss cost trends in homeowners accelerate a bit, and the folks at ASI are responding.","Bob Glasspiegel","Thank you.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks Bob.","Julia Hornack","Brian can we take the next question from the conference call line please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Mr. Pan, your line is now open.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. The first question is on the reinsurance side. If the reinsurance rates are going up, would that impact your reinsurance strategy and would you be able to pass on some of the increasing cost to your Home customers?","Tricia Griffith","We don't know for sure if reinsurance will go up. That'll be dependent after everything. It's true in different companies. We believe that we have a great strategy in terms of having multiple policies that are staggered in different years. So we will - we always take a look to try to minimize our downside and we'll take action depending on what the reinsurance market does and what we feel like we need.","But we want to obviously protect that spike in homeowners. So John just talked about that. And having two of the biggest storms in history in two of our biggest states for Home, we realized how important - not that we didn't before - how important to homeowners reinsurance is and we'll do, what we need to do to protect that downside.","John Sauerland","If I might interject, I may have misspoken in my response to Bob. Inception-to-date, our combined ratio for homeowners is a little higher than we modeled. I think I shared that in my comments. But in case that was a misstatement on my part in Bob's response, I apologize. We are slightly above inception-to-date.","Tricia Griffith","Kai did that answer your question?","Kai Pan","Yes. My followup question is on the auto sort of loss frequency and we have seen pretty sort of like a lot of improvements so far this year. I just wonder, could you give a little bit color on the sort of what's like the puts and takes in there and how sustainable is that going forward?","Tricia Griffith","I will start with the sustainable piece, Kai. It's really hard to understand necessarily frequency because a lot of macroeconomic trends can change with frequency. What we do see internally that we believe is favorable on that side is the fact that we have a much more preferred mix of customers and so we know that that's what lowered the frequency.","We have some upfront underwriting we've put in, in the last several years that we believe is making a difference and when we look at our snapshot data, we have longer miles. So think of longer trips. So think of trips over 15 miles. And we're seeing that, and we believe that the Snapshot population kind of mirrors the rest of our Population. So when we think about that and create hypotheses around frequency, those are normally what we talk about. And we always have other underlying hypotheses that we continue to try to quantify. But we wouldn't want to try to predict frequency we react to it.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks Kai.","Julia Hornack","All right, I'm going to take a question from the webcast at this time. So the question is from Austin Boaz from Principal Global Investors.","Austin Boaz","Do you think there would be better acceptance by independent agents of homeowners insurance if ASI was rebranded as, say, Progressive Home, for example? Why keep ASI as its own brand name? So a two-part question.","Tricia Griffith","Great question Austin. Yes, and thank you, we're going to be doing that. So yes, we - so let's move back up. So we purchased ASI because in the states they were in, they were known as the preferred brand and agency channel. And for years because of our heritage of being a nonstandard auto, we knew that was a good marriage. So we've learned from - as the last couple of years have gone through, not just from agents but from ASI as a team, we knew there'd be a right time when we decide to name the product Progressive Home. So over the last year or so, all of us have had lots of conversations with agents.","And these are agents in some of the agencies where they have been an ASI agent for a long time and they said, \"You know what? It's time to leverage the Progressive brand and have it be Progressive Home and Progressive Auto.\" And so we've decided to do this. It will take some time, because of just systems and different things. But Heather's actually - will be running that project, and you can add in any more if you want, but yes, we think it's the time. We now are known as an auto home bundler. We have the right brand for that. It's a preferred product on both the auto and home side, and it's perfectly the right time, so great advice, Austin. Do you want to add anything?","Heather Day","I would just echo what Tricia just said. We tread very carefully here, knowing the legacy that ASI had built with agents in its existing states and how well recognized they were by those agents. As we expand it again, it was one of those, we've got those deep agent relationships through the Platinum program. We listened carefully and understood that as we are beginning to build out the Progressive Home brand generally, this was really the right time to make the switch, so yes, under way.","Tricia Griffith","And I would tell you, the first person that would say we absolutely have to do this is John Auer, the CEO of ASI, and he's leading the way as well.","Julia Hornack","All right, Brian can we take the next question from the conference call line please?","Operator","Of course. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Campbell from KBW. Mr. Campbell, your line is now open.","Christopher Campbell","Yes, hi good morning.","Tricia Griffith","Good morning.","Christopher Campbell","The question on auto, do you think the reinsurance on your auto line would be useful given there is probably a benefit if you did a multiproduct treaty now does Progressive approach that type of question?","Tricia Griffith","That's a great question. We've been talking about that for the last couple of years as we've integrated with ASI. We have it on some of our commercial auto. So the higher limit Commercial Auto, over $1 million, we have reinsurance. I think as we think about continuing to expand, we always consider and protect the downside and weigh that with the cost. So it's something we talk about often to determine does that makes sense, does it make sense especially like you said with the multi treaty. We haven't gone there yet, but it is - it's just something we discussed.","Christopher Campbell","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And just the followup is how would you categorize the relative sophistication between your auto and homeowners pricing right now?","Tricia Griffith","So from Auto, we have had years and years of segmentation, and a lot of variables go into our auto pricing and then recently, of course, we've added the upfront underwriting. On the home side, there's been a lot more underwriting in terms of acceptable risks. So coming in the door, knowing right away what we would accept and what we wouldn't. Now we're really starting to share data and best practices with both companies to really get the best of both worlds.","So sharing the underwriting sophistication from ASI as well as our pricing and segmentation sophistication and we've been doing a lot more of our business reviews collectively together. That's one of the reasons why we had Dave Pratt come down to work with the ASI folks. And we work back and forth to really share the best of both worlds. So I would say each company has different levels of sophistication. So together, I believe we're going to have a really optimal approach to even understanding segmentation at a more granular level.","Christopher Campbell","Well, thanks for all the answers.","Tricia Griffith","Thank you.","Julia Hornack","Brian the next question from the conference call line please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber from William Blair. Mr. Klauber, your line is now open.","Adam Klauber","Thanks. On Platinum, I think you mentioned 5% of the agencies are currently Platinum and also you're being selective. But as we think about a couple of years down the line, will that be multiples of the 5%?","Tricia Griffith","Yes, we will obviously select more Platinum agents as we grow and expand and we really have always positioned it as a scarcity model. And we want to make sure these agents, when customers come into their agency, we're their first or second choice. And some agents actually won't have access to the customers that want to have a home and bundled package or maybe don't own a home.","So we will expand when we believe it will increase our Robinsons population, our auto home bundle. We'll be expanding for sure in the next couple of years just because of our geographic expansion. And then we'll likely step back and say, \"Are there opportunities in different geographic locations to increase our Platinum agency population?\".","Adam Klauber","Okay, thanks. And then could you talk a bit more, I think you said in '18 that you're rolling out for Platinum a better interface and also better bonus program. Could you just talk about those a bit more?","Tricia Griffith","Yes. I'll have Heather talk specifically about the bonus program. I brought up the overall commission schedule that we talked about during the last webcast, so we call it Paths to Partnership, and we are investing a lot overall in our agency platform with IT, just to make things smooth and easy for agents to be able to have that auto and home and bundle online in the same system. Do you want to give any specifics on that?","Heather Day","Well, I would - I think underlying this question is a sense of what kind of levels of investment are we looking at in terms of Platinum and how does that line up in terms of our cost structure. Let me know if I'm off-base on that. I think we feel very good that we are coming into the Platinum program with a very competitive cost structure in the agency channel.","And as I think about the investments we are making in terms of ease-of-use with the overall platform as well as thinking about how we are going to compensate agents for both their bundled business and for other lines of business that they're writing with us, we are really rethinking about both the quality and the volume of the business we're getting, the kind of retention we expect to see with this bundled business. So overall, these investments should align us - should position us very well for growth, but we do not expect upward pressure on the combined ratio. We will keep that very same target in place.","Adam Klauber","Okay, thank you. And also the last on bundled, you showed the Robinsons population is growing pretty aggressively in bundled. Is that coming - is that growth coming more from the captive or independent agency channel or both?","Tricia Griffith","I would say the majority of the Robinson bundle is coming from the independent agents channel. That's not to say that it's captive, Robinsons aren't shopping as well. And of course, the other part of the Robinsons bundle, not with Platinum but on - in our in-house agency on the direct side, really comes from the overall population in terms of what John had talked about with a lot of graduations of our Dianes and other people in our segmentation, so it's really across the board. But if I had to stay on the agency side, the majority of our growth is coming directly from the independent agent channel.","Adam Klauber","Okay, great, thanks a lot.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks.","Julia Hornack","Brian, can we please take the next question from the conference call line please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Mr. Meredith your line is now open.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. Hi Trish.","Tricia Griffith","Hi Brian.","Brian Meredith","A couple of questions, first, back on the frequency. I'm wondering, do you see any benefit, or in any of your data, see any benefit when you do have some major hurricanes or catastrophic events like this did you see a decline in frequency?","Tricia Griffith","Yes, we talk about that. We can't surgically say absolutely yes. Right after Harvey, I walked into John's office and asked him the same question. Let's look at this. So I wouldn't be able to say concretely absolutely. We look at that, try to address that, but it's really specifically an unknown. I think the philosophy and probably what you're getting at, Brian, is - so if you leave, is there less frequency in BI et cetera. We look at that. We can't exactly point to yes, that, that equates to frequency because again that is a couple of states and we have the whole country to contend with when we look at overall frequency.","Brian Meredith","Great. And also just on that topic, if you quantify or can you give us a sense of what benefits you're seeing on frequency from kind of mix shift to more preferred? And kind of what do you expect kind of going forward?","Tricia Griffith","I can't give you very - specifics in terms of that, but we know when we have the more preferred customer that - and the ones that stay longer, so we're going to be making more money over a long period of time that we benefit from that mix of customer. And I think the exciting part about this is that as we talked about, we have so much momentum going on and so much more to capture and we're seeing this now. So we believe that if it continues, hopefully, we'll have those low pure premium customers that will benefit us, so we won't be able to tell. It's not something we can predict. We don't put it into our pricing, we watch for it. But having a more preferred customer, we believe, will benefit us.","Brian Meredith","Great. And just one last question, could you provide us with kind of what the competitive landscape looks like right now in the direct agency distribution segment?","Tricia Griffith","Heather, if you want to add the agency part, you can. I think, overall, every or most companies increased rates a fair amount in 2016. Our philosophy has been for a long time and we tried to do it; we can't always do is take small bites of the apple and continue to stay ahead of trend. We are seeing a couple competitors raising rates higher than we are. And so we believe that the hard market will continue to persist, I think especially after the hurricanes, so I won't speak of specific competitors. We obviously watch that from a competitive landscape, but there's a couple of companies that clearly need some rate in the system, and we believe that will have the hard market continue. Competitors from the agency side, do you have any?","Heather Day","So as we think about the competitive landscape on the agency side, it clearly varies across the country in terms of which competitors are relatively well positioned in different regions. We actually even think about it at the agent level. So as we are thinking through where our opportunities lie, understanding the competitive set within particular agencies is how we are getting a sense of where we have upsides. So it's a state-by-state, are we - is the market hardening across both the auto and home and what opportunities do we have in that particular agency and that's where our state-based field and sales model is really beneficial.","Brian Meredith","Great, thank you.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks, Brian.","Julia Hornack","All right, I am going to take a few questions from the webcast. The first question is from Mark Lane from William Blair. I'm going to do my best to rephrase this just a little bit.","Mark Lane","Can you make money on providing third-party insurance on homeowners?","Julia Hornack","And I'll let you answer that first, and then I'll ask the second piece.","Tricia Griffith","Okay. Yes. We - with our third-party insurance carriers, we receive a commission when we sell homeowners. And remember, what we really - the intent of having multiple unaffiliated carriers and ASI on the direct side was really to extend the auto PLE, so when we've talked about that for years, being able to say that bundled customers, whether or not we write it on our own paper, really the goal is to extend the PLE of the auto.","Julia Hornack","Right, and then the second piece of the question is\u2026","Mark Lane","Including the homeowners policies that we sell through our third-party insurers, our unaffiliated carriers, how would we think about estimating our market share in homeowners?","Tricia Griffith","We don't really publicize that. We've put the income in our service revenue and - but we have - we don't share that data.","Julia Hornack","Okay. All right. Thank you. So the next question is from Matthew Goetzinger from Fiduciary Management.","Matthew Goetzinger","So the question is essentially, as Robinsons grow as a contributor to the company, the assumption would be that Robinsons have comprehensive on their auto insurance policies today. So therefore, as comprehensive - as comprehensive grows as a percentage of the coverage that our customers choose, would that change our reinsurance philosophy on auto insurance for the long term?","Tricia Griffith","Yes, we'll always look at our reinsurance. I wouldn't necessarily say all Robinsons would have comp coverage, I mean some would, especially if there's a lien. But we watch the line coverage codes across our insurers. And if we felt that, that was necessary to protect the downside, we would absolutely consider it.","John Sauerland","I might add to that. Recognize that within our pricing in states where -- that are more prone to storms, there are what we consider catastrophe loads in the pricing. So we are looking back over history to understand what we think, over a reasonable period of time, is necessary to cover storm losses. So while it's not reinsurance, it is built into those comprehensive rates. And we think we're adequately priced in comprehensive.","Julia Hornack","All right. Brian can we take a question from the conference call line please?","Operator","Of course. Our next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Mr. Gutterman, your line is now open.","Ian Gutterman","Hi, thank you. I had a quick question on Harvey and then I had a question on the agency growth. Tricia, can you walk through a little bit sort of how you came up with your Harvey auto estimate? And I guess what I'm looking at is - I think you even said it in your video - about 500,000 cars damaged in Houston and your market share appears to be about 10% in Texas. Now maybe it's different in the Houston area, but that would imply close to 50,000 cars and your 200-something million implies only 5,000 severity, which seems very low to me. So were you underweighted in Houston or can you give us a sense of what kind of severity you're using per car?","Tricia Griffith","I don't know that we've shared severity. We look at - we model it out. Every storm, we model it out and we look at the share of market within certain areas. And Harvey was a little bit unusual because there were areas that were completely flooded, and we may or may not have had a higher or lower market share in those certain areas; and some were force flooded and some people left. So we literally modeled that one out prior to it happening and ongoing, and the severity was a little bit higher because most of those cars were totaled. But I will tell you, we feel that we have been very adequate in our reserving for both Harvey and Irma.","Ian Gutterman","Is your market share in Houston similar to your market share in the State of Texas?","Tricia Griffith","Yes.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. Fair enough. So on the agency side, obviously the growth has been very impressive and I just want to understand, obviously, some of it is the initiatives you've talked about on the call, but I was hoping maybe you had some data you can share on sort of where customers are coming from? Is most of the priors coming from other agency carriers that ask for too much rate and they're coming to you or do you feel it's sort of the captive guys are moving into the agency? Just anything you can share on that?","Tricia Griffith","Yes. What I would say overall is that it really has to do with the agents shopping for a great product at a great rate. And so when you talk about that, when you think about that hard market, most of those customers are coming - that are within their agency are likely to come to independent agents. I wouldn't say necessarily from captive. I don't know that, but anecdotally I would say people usually go to the captive or go to independent agents, so it's really about us having a different product in the market.","So a couple of years ago, when we put out really our first preferred auto product, 83 and now it's evolved to 84, that has really been the shift in our ability to get more customers and having that right price. So we feel like we've got - we were in a good position in 2015, we've continued to benefit from having better product models with better segmentation at a good rate, at a great rate, because we're able to get ahead of that trend. And that's really been so important to us not to rate shock our customers because that ends up upsetting the agents and then they shop around. And that's really where we've been seeing the growth.","Ian Gutterman","Well, that actually kind of led into what I wanted to ask, was I assume - so part of this especially in the - again, I understand the direct is a different environment, but in the agency environment where it seems like we've gotten so used to the, whatever you want to call it, the power of the rater and low man win sort of thing, it feels like some of that business that other people won maybe from you maybe a few years ago ended up being bad business for them. So now it comes back out, they're asking for more rate.","You're maybe lower than what they're asking for, but how comfortable are you or how much analytics do you have to sort of see how the performance of that book was for someone else. I guess I'm worried a little bit just that the rate of growth - if someone else was getting it at a 110, and couldn't get the rate they want to renew it and the agency put it back in the rater, can you really get it to a 96 right away or do you have to bring it on with a heavy new business penalty and assume it takes two or three renewals to get into the 96?","Tricia Griffith","Yes, that's a really good question. We have very specific targets in the agency channel per state, new and renewal. So we - when we're looking at this and why I've bee, I think, elated with the 84 model is the fact that we're writing at or sometimes below target for those - that new business. So we do feel good about that. If we didn't, we wouldn't - we would slow down growth. And you've seen us do that because you don't want to have that come back. If someone leaves after six months, that's not a good business model. So we feel very good and very adequate with our rate in the agency side.","Ian Gutterman","Great, thank you.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks.","Julia Hornack","[Operator Instructions] We have a few more questions from the webcast. The first one is again from Mark Lane at William Blair.","Mark Lane","It's essentially around the purchase price for the ASI minority shareholders. Has that already been a negotiated deal and how is that valuation structured?","John Sauerland","Yes, I'll take that. Yes, that was part of the original purchase agreement and the price at which we will purchase shares, either next year or in 2021, is a function of the change in the tangible book value of the company, plus the original price per share. There's also a multiplier that is applied to that change in tangible book value that is determined by a matrix of growth and profitability. It can vary from 1 up to a total - a high of two. So in addition to the base share price that we paid back in 2015, you add the change in book value times that multiple from one to two, and that's how the price we pay is derived.","Julia Hornack","All right. The next question again is from the webcast from Matthew Goetzinger at Fiduciary Management.","Matthew Goetzinger","The question is really two parts and the first is regarding the launch of UBI in the Commercial Lines market, so using ELD for truck drivers, how aggressive do you anticipate being on premium discounts given the small initial base of existing statistical loss data?","Tricia Griffith","So how we're going to work discounts in the ELD is if a current customer has at least three months of driving data, you will get - you could get anywhere up to 18% discount, because we already have some knowledge of your driving data. If we don't have any knowledge of it, you'll get a 3% participation discount, and then after that three months of data, you could get upwards of an additional 15% for a maximum of 18%. So I'm sure things will change as we know more, but we believe we've gotten out ahead of it, working with some of the vendors. But that's our current structure as we head into 2018.","Julia Hornack","Great. Brian, can we take another question from the conference call line please?","Operator","Of course. Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] Asset Management. Joe, your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. Just a kind of a 30,000-foot question, when you guys acquired ASI, I think Glenn Renwick was very clear in saying the only way a success of the deal would be measured is if you're selling more car insurance through agents. Can you talk about whether that measuring stick has changed or morphed at all at this point?","Tricia Griffith","Yes well, you know having worked with Glenn for so many years, I'm sure that was a statement. But it was really - the acquisition of ASI was getting access to those agents who wrote those preferred homes and to be able to bundle the homes. So we've talked a lot about extending auto PLEs. So I think with any good business model, especially as we integrated and have such a good partnership and relationship with ASI, we always want to evolve. But ultimately we want to be able to have as many preferred Robinsons auto home bundled in the agency channel as possible while reaching our target goals - our target margins. So yes, it's evolved, but I think it's evolved with what Glenn would have had in mind as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks.","Julia Hornack","It would appear that we have no further questions, and so that concludes our event today."],"17710":["Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Q3 2012 Earnings Call November  2, 2012  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Matt Downing","Glenn M.

So with rate increases matching the rise in severity, but seemingly above the combined loss cost trend of frequency plus severity, would your targets be to drive margin significantly below 96 to provide a cushion for future loss cost spikes? Or is it more to get back to 96 in order to begin growing PIF again?","Glenn M. Renwick","More the latter, 96. We're never so perfect on all of that targeting, nor do we know exactly what future trends will be. But if we can just quickly recap through the year, let's just focus on auto, we've taken about 6 points of rate, give or take. A little bit differently, agency and direct, but that's reasonably close. Second quarter, I think we explained very carefully that we got a little bit behind on timing so we've taken some additional rate during the second and third quarter. And as I said on my letter, I think we've got a nice matching now. We will continue, that doesn't -- that's not a onetime issue, so we'll continue to take trend and do our normal rate revision processes. So rate revision processes are completely dynamic, happen all the time. What really happened in the second and third quarter was just a little bit of a catch-up for, perhaps, some trend that we may have gotten just little behind on, but our targets remain at 96. And as I said in the letter, while we're thankful for the inflationary premium growth, which is certainly apparent, we'd love to get unit growth and that's what we seek. We seek the combination of growing and good margins. So continue to try to think of us as a company that's going to grow where the opportunity exists and hit our target margins, but target margins come first.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And as a final follow-up, the expense ratio seems to be cracking recently below historical trend. Can you talk about the drivers there and how long these levels could persist if at all?","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes, Brian.","Brian C. Domeck","You're right that the expense ratio in the third quarter, in particular, in the last several months, has been a little bit lower. A big component piece is in the third quarter, we consciously decided to reduce a little bit of our advertising spend relative -- certainly to what we had [indiscernible] coming into the year and actually, or spending on a little lower rate than last year at this time. So some of that is contributing to the lower expense ratio and you could see that more obviously in the direct channel expense ratio versus the agency. And then the other component piece is just with the earned premium growth being at higher levels than we've experienced for a number of years, we're gaining some leverage on the higher earned premium relative to salary costs and other fixed expenses in the organization. But it's the combination of the lower advertising spend plus higher earned premium growth rate that's really driving it.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So that one, that lower ad spend, I believe, at the Investor Day, you might have alluded to you not being as happy with kind of what you're receiving the -- from the ad spend, or could you comment on that?","Brian C. Domeck","It was less about being comfortable with the yield on the ad spend. It was our decisions here in the third quarter were more trying to make certain that we hit the profit objective, that 96 combined ratio that we talk about quite frequently and want to meet. So it was a conscious decision more there than the yield or the acquisition cost for cost -- the cost for sale versus targeted cost for sale was slightly higher than our targeted, but that wasn't the real driver. The real driver is trying to ensure that we meet 96 combined ratio for the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up on the expense ratio on the advertising expenses once again. So the expense ratio within the direct platform has averaged roughly 20% to 21% over the last few years, but that spiked for the last couple of years to around 22%. What do you think is the more normalized rate? I mean, does your -- the expense ratio within that channel has come down. So would you think the roughly 21% rate is the more normal ratio, or is the 22%?","Brian C. Domeck","Well it would be -- it's tough to say normal. Here's what I'll tell you would be the drivers. When we talk about this, a fair amount in terms of our ad spend, assuming we are meeting our overall profit targets, we would base it upon the yield that we get in terms of our acquisition costs, cost for sale versus what we call our targeted acquisition cost. And while we're comfortable with that, we'll keep spending. If we go above it by a lot, we would then revisit those spend levels. And so -- and we do that on a regular basis. It can be monthly, quarterly or et cetera that we're evaluating that. So that would be one component piece, and so it's pretty dynamic. We believe, as we are much more comfortable with our aggregate rate accuracy, that we will actually go back to higher levels of ad spend. But we'll see how that plays out. But that is the thought at least right now, that although third quarter was down and fourth quarter is likely to be a little bit lower, we will return to a higher ad level spend as we get more and more comfortable with our rate accuracy. A second component piece is, what I mentioned in terms of gaining some leverage on fixed costs and other, call it, employee compensation cost, et cetera. We've got, over time, we definitely aspire to grow earned premium growth at faster levels than those costs, so that should have a long-term decrease in terms of our cost structure, both in LAE and expense ratio. Then the final thing, which is very, very important in a direct channel is the new renewal mix because remember, we have very different targets for new business versus renewal business and we allocate all of our advertising costs in new business. If we don't get the yield as much in new business, yes, we would reduce or adjust our advertising spend. If we are getting the growth, that Glenn so referred to earlier, we will continue to spend as long as we're meeting that new business target and renewal business target. So I'd say it's a combination of rate accuracy, we'd spend more. Other expenses, long-term, we actually hope to gain some leverage on. So what will the run rate for the expense ratio be for direct going forward, I think it's a combination of those effects. But, that's ...","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure. Yes, just on the advertising expenses, once again. Next year, do you expect to increase the spend more than the growth in the top line, or sort of in line with the growth in the top line?","Brian C. Domeck","I'd say probably pretty closely in line with expected earned premium growth.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. So the expense ratio impact on that would be about flat year-over-year, but higher sort of on the absolute dollar spend?","Brian C. Domeck","Yes. But it's not going to match one for one, but closer to earned premium growth than in certainly in when we are increasing advertising spend 20% or 25% a year, plus perhaps some earned premium growth that was driving the direct expense ratio higher in past years. Now, it's more closely -- more closer in line to earned premium growth.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. Then the other question was really on the margin of safety. So I believe management has always said you have a 96% target on the combined ratio, but you -- but historically, you've had a margin of safety that resulted in a combined ratio being closer to 92%, 93%. With the introduction of Snapshot, do you think that you can now reduce the margin of safety because you can now model your business better? Or do you think you still have to keep the historical margin on safety?","Glenn M. Renwick","Vinay, I don't think you should sort of take into the margin of safety issue you're calling at the 92%. When the marketplace is such that -- and I don't want to give a long history of why the marketplace has acted the way it has for the last decade or so, but certainly when it's available to us, we will continue to grow, and if we can make a 92 or a 93, then that's a combination we would accept if the market conditions were favorable to do so. I think what I've been saying for quite some time now is the market conditions are much more in the mode of we will be closer to our 96 to be able to continue to grow. So think of us not so much as trying to build in a safety margin, but trying to be as aggressive in the marketplace as possible, but put a very high premium on attaining our 96 or better. Snapshot really doesn't change that. We're pricing Snapshot product or the discounts that we embed from Snapshot so that we hit exactly the same type of targets. Giving discounts is a very, very tricky thing. You're clearly reducing the margin on that particular, or the price on that particular customer, but we expect to make the same margin. So don't -- I would just encourage you, don't think about sort of a 92, 93 as some act of built-in safety margin. Think of us for what we say we're going to try to do, is grow as fast as possible at a 96% and everything we do, whether it's Snapshot or a Name your Price or anything else, we design to meet the same targets.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Looking in the Q, I see a combination of things, one is that your new policy applications after being up for the first half of the year have shifted down. I'm wondering if you can comment on whether it's accelerating or whether negative 4%, given the new rates, is kind of where it stands? And two, it's difficult for me to turn renewal application growth into a retention statistic. You guys are a bigger company than you were a year ago. Are retention statistics more or less the same than they were a year ago, or has something changed?","Glenn M. Renwick","Josh, on new applications, you're right. Clearly, the rate pressure, I mean, pretty simple physics here. Took rates up, we see the effect in new apps. The 4% that we've put there, not going to forecast it, but until we see some competitive actions that are even stronger than the ones we've seen, and clearly, we are seeing competitive actions that are, in the vast majority of cases, positive, but I expect that we will see, for some time, pressure on new applications. I'm not going to give an estimate of what that will be, but that's not going to turn around any time soon. That will take a little bit of market force. But given that we're going to continue to focus on our target margins, we are very comfortable with that trade-off. Renewal apps, yes, you see. You know there's sort of a reason that will be. We obviously put on new business, it's coming through as renewals. We've not -- we don't give specific PLEs by different classes of business. But we've given some indication that, at least for our Agency book of business, policy life expectancy is actually increasing. And for our Direct book, which had actually been experiencing some negative, it's now much more of a flat PLE. So while there will be a delayed effect on that as well, and I'm not going to forecast exactly what they will be, as of right now, we're very comfortable with our retention statistics for the customers that have actually experienced rate increases as well. New business probably more concerning and I expect that, that will turn around at some point, but I'm not going to forecast that point.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And you've mentioned that, I think the word you used was integral, that Progressive Home Advantage is an integral part of the product offering. I think that's the word you used, I may be mistaken there. But can we go into a little bit -- is there any metrics you can give us about the success in implementing Progressive Home Advantage? I know it's been slower on the uptake than you guys would have wanted starting back 3 years ago. Do you have some success stories you can share with us?","Glenn M. Renwick","Let's break it into 2 pieces, our Direct piece and our Agency piece. And I don't want to sort of necessarily recount any statements that might have been made, but actually, we're quite comfortable with what's happening on, certainly, on the Direct side. Recognize that one of the key objectives there, we'd like to bring in new business to PHA, but one of the things we've always set out to do is make sure we don't lose current business that we have when there is a life change that requires someone to get a home policy. And about 50% of our business in PHA are our own customers maturing into greater insurance needs and us being able to accommodate them. So frankly, we're actually very happy with PHA on the Direct side. Second point would be on the Agency side where we very clearly said, we did not get out of the box, a good solution for agents. The company was fine, it just wasn't suited for agents. As you know and announced in June that we've entered into a relationship, a significant relationship, with ASI, a relatively small company, but very much in tune with, culturally, where we are and the sorts of things we want to achieve for our agents. We have been taking, over the last several months, the notion of Progressive and ASI as a little bit -- a lot more of an integrated offering for agents. Clearly, not the same as if it came from one company. But in this case, 2 companies that are very, very good at what they do, coming together, providing some, not only technology that integrates the product, but actually some product features. And that is being very well received by agents. I have personally been out and talking to agents, done some conference calls with agents. Think this is something new to the marketplace in the sense that 2 very well-respected companies coming together, putting their offerings together in ways that actually are designed for agents, and we're actually -- too early to sort of give you a lot of metrics as to what's happening there. We do have agency selection there. We're not necessarily giving that to all agents. And we're looking for agents who have a very preferred book of business to be able to give us from a new business perspective. And we are seeing early signs that agents, certain agents, not all, are feeling that this is a very viable solution for them. And we're very, very optimistic about the future of the ASI Progressive relationship. It is going to be small for some time. Recognize this zone of preferred customers who are looking for home and auto is about 43% of the marketplace. Actually, I can even make that a little higher the way we define things, but it's a big chunk of the marketplace. It is a big chuck of the marketplace that we have extraordinary low penetration in. And agents have a very large part of that marketplace. So for us to be able to be on the verge of taking something to agents, that really does give them the opportunity to have a coordinated bundle of home and auto, is actually very exciting, and I think that excitement is spilling over from agents. So that question will be a good question. We'll have more data on exactly our progress a year from now. But I would say that's a very optimistic part of our outlook for next year.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is there anything about the product where ASI has become your preferred vendor compared to your other partners?","Glenn M. Renwick","For agency, it is our preferred vendor for agency. For direct, we'll have multiple carriers that we plan to use. But on the agency channel, this is one where agents have a workflow that needs to be respected and the technology that we've worked on together to present our products together, to present sort of data sharing, so on and so forth, it is absolutely our preferred option in the agency channel.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Ryan with UBS.","Robert P. Ryan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","What are your observations on Hurricane Sandy? And what would you like investors to know as it relates to auto insurance in general? And specifically, Progressive?","Glenn M. Renwick","Sure. I think we all want to know sort of where Sandy settles out and I'm sure every insurance company right now is doing the best to give what they can. Let me tell you what I know and then try to avoid saying things that we simply don't know. Overnight reporting, I expect has probably bumped us up to about a 6,000 claims. So we've got about 6,000 claims, that's a little higher than the number I had last night, but I suspect that, that's well on its way to that number. Think of that as 2\/3 flood, 1\/3 wind. About just short of 80% of it is New York, New Jersey, the rest would be another 10% Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and then obviously, other states that you all know are affected. That's sort of what we know right now. Spud [ph] claims for us are probably going to be, more often than not, total losses. So order is not good for cars. So we have some estimates. We don't know exactly where and we have great models, but all models are exactly that. Don't know where the reporting will end. It's the advantage for you and for us. We will release results in about 12 days or whatever that is, 12 to 15 days, something like that, for October. And literally, as every hour goes by, the development of claim reporting is helping us. So we'll actually have a pretty good estimate of our exposure by the time we will produce results in about 12 or 13 days. So far, 6,000 claims. I don't want to even speculate as to where that is. If I gave you sort of a ballpark-ish thing, you would sort of maybe take it the wrong way, but I suspect we're seeing half of the claims we're getting or in that neighborhood. So, but there are people, clearly, as we all know, without power and so on and so forth. So these reporting patterns might be just a little bit different than the experience. As you would expect from Progressive and hopefully, all other insurance companies at this point, the job #1 is getting everybody back to the conditions that they can move on with their lives. So we have deployed and we are active, as you would expect, in the marketplace with resources and doing a great job for the people that have reported their claims. And hopefully, we can get as many of the unreported claims in within the next few days so we can get on those as quickly as possible. Hopefully, for any of you listening that were affected by the storm, hopefully, you're able to get your lives back to a situation that's comfortable for you or your families or whatever. So that event, insurance companies, I think in general, are stepping up and I know that Progressive will step up really well.","Robert P. Ryan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. Completely unrelated, the investment portfolio. What have been your actions considering the low interest rate environment? And what should we think of in terms of strategy going forward?","Glenn M. Renwick","That's fair. We have Bill on the line so I'll let him take us through that.","William M. Cody","Sure. Our actions have been consistent with what they've been historically, which is to try to look for value where we see it. We are not trying to hit the yield bogey, which is something nice about the way we run things here is there's no pressure to try to stretch to reach some artificial or hoped for number. We take what's available. And for us, that's been trying to find spread product primarily in, say, corporates or munis or CMBS or sectors like that, that offers some reasonable, relative value and some decent absolute value as well. That's become a little bit harder to find as spreads have come in from all sectors. But still in all, we have found a few pockets to invest in, and when we see those opportunities, we'll take them, and when we don't, we don't feel pressure to put money to work and take risks that we don't think are appropriate to take.","Operator","Our next question is from Meyer Shields from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two questions, if I can. One, with all the uncertainty surrounding health care reform and I guess the election, how are you, I guess, booking reserves? What inflation rate for medical costs are you assuming?","Glenn M. Renwick","Look, that's perhaps, create a bigger disconnect from any other health care bills and so on and so forth -- the reform -- because that's just probably stretching it to believe that we could be that precise. The easy answer for you for our outlook right now on bodily injury, which is one of our clearly most important trend estimates, both for pricing and for reserving, 4 to 6, 3 to 6. Don't want to be vague there, but that's sort of a range that feels about right to us. So and frankly, if I go back in my career, sort of 3 to 5 is being a fairly good estimate of bodily injury trend which is largely reflective of medical costs as one of the underlying drivers of it. So that's our assumptions going forward. So what we've talked about, and I discussed in the letter, they would sort of taken a shot at rates, we've gotten back to margins that we think are about right, recognize trend is always ongoing, so we're going to have to price that in. And our current estimate of trend going forward is sort of that the 3 to 5, 4 to 6 kind of range on bodily injury. So far, frequency, if I had to sum up frequency, it's mostly noise, plus or minus 1% on most coverages. So not a lot of frequency as the big driver of things. That can get awkward if that's the driver. So it's mostly a severity issue, and I would say if you're using your models or your estimation or you're thinking about how Progressive might act, we're thinking around 3 to 5 in bodily injury trend.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. No, that's helpful. I don't know if it's possible to disentangle the ramp up of the Snapshot free trial from the issues you've had with raising rates and the impact on new applications. But can you talk a little bit about how the performance of this particular strategy has played out in 2012 and maybe 2013 expectations?","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes. Probably mixed bag, to be honest, our volume of people actually taking the Test Drive has underperformed our internal estimates as we formulate estimates on everything even if we haven't done them before. And frankly, I would say this, volume-wise, is under our estimations. So just call it the way it is. Certainly, we got an awful lot of interest or clicks, but I'm not sure that, that necessarily is the operative measure. Of those that ultimately take the trial, the funnel that we had expected is a lot of the estimates we had made that are panning out. So actually, we are taking people all the way through the funnel, and the good news is that of those that are self-identifying and taking the test, a very large number of them are actually getting the opportunity to get a discount off of what our rates otherwise would have been. Who's taking the test? That actually is quite a nice positive for us. If I just focus on the 3 companies, the 3 auto companies that are, by market share, larger than us, we have more than 50% of the people who are taking the Test Drive are actually distributed amongst those 3 companies. So it is actually very encouraging for us that while Test Drive is not likely, nor was it ever designed, to try to get at the shopper who was going to be shopping in the next day, next week, next month. This was to try and get people to sort of think about shopping who would not otherwise have shopped, I would expect to get market share from companies that, perhaps, maybe had more entrenched customers. And that seems to be happening. So I'm very happy with the mix of customers that are taking us up. That mix is flowing through to the sales. And again, I don't want to overstate, the numbers are not sort of dramatic enough to really move the needle. So everything we had hoped for in Test Drive is coming through, except the volume is less than we would've hoped. So what are we doing about that? We are clearly very encouraged that our understanding, the public understanding of Snapshot\/Test Drive, and I'll blend the 2 here a little bit, is about 56% awareness. So the awareness of this concept, which if you think about it, is still relatively new to the industry, is actually now quite high amongst the consuming public. The attribution to Progressive is about 84%. So people actually know about what it is and they attribute it to us. I would tell you, and this is a little looser, that while there is a general understanding, there is still a fair amount of ambiguity as to exactly what to do about it and what it will do for me. As a result, we have been doing consumer research and we have a new campaign targeted that will be quite different than we've done before. So a new campaign to try and inspire people to better understand what Snapshot\/Test Drive can do and will do for them. So in short, really happy with some of the mix issues that are coming through. Really happy with the fact that people are getting discounts, and then clearly, those discounts, by the way, translate into higher satisfaction scores, which translate into higher retention scores. So the kind of flow-through to the funnel is absolutely a positive flow-through, we just need to have more volume through the funnel and to that end, we've got some, what I consider to be, quite interesting marketing ideas and they will manifest themselves in the first quarter next year.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan Chase.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess one question I had for you was around advertising. If you all chose, depending on the effectiveness of the rate increases and where margins settle out on a state-by-state basis. If you choose to take advertising up, what -- how should we think about the normal, kind of lag, between when you spend and when you actually see the growth show up in terms of policy counts and then ultimately, in earnings? And I guess, the reason I'm asking is because the data that I've seen, which is actually a little bit more focused on life insurance than PNC, is that it's, for Direct response that it's often -- it often takes 6 to 8 months to actually get scale in the response rate. So just trying to figure out that dynamic.","Brian C. Domeck","Sure, Matthew. For us, when we change our advertising spend, we actually see a fair amount of effects pretty quickly. I wouldn't say it's a 6- or an 8-month lag that life might have. And it's not like one-for-one. But when we reduce our spend, we generally see a decline in prospects. And when prospects -- prospects being people who quote with us  --and likewise when we increase it, we see a return, but I would also say it probably does differ a little bit based upon media type. What I mean by that, for example, if we were to spend more or less on paid search, where people who are looking for car insurance, you know there are shoppers in the marketplace, there, you clearly see a very fast reaction to increases in spend and bid prices and ranking and people quoting with you. TV, radio and other media types might be a little bit of a different immediate response versus lag function. But when we -- generally speaking, when we change our ad spend, we will see a corresponding activity in terms of the number of people quoting with us fairly fast.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess the other thing is right, there's obviously a lot of questions around frequency and severity, and there is, for a whole host of reasons. But just curious, when we think about -- new car sales have picked up, it looks like people are -- the car fleet's actually growing in addition to seeing replacement. My presumption would be, and I might be stretching with this, but my presumption would be that most new car sales are either leased or financed, and that the lenders generally acquire, I think, lower deductibles than one might choose if they potentially owned the car. So curious if, one, if that deductible difference really exists? And if so, is that something that potentially, on a kind of -- on a reported basis, potentially makes the severity look worse than it really is, just on a mix basis?","Glenn M. Renwick","I'm not sure I have a really meaningful answer for you there, Matthew. I understand, but I don't think our deductible mix has changed very much for a good number of years. So I think to see that flow through into severity numbers, you'd really be stretching it.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's fair. I do -- it was just the only thing I could think of to ask about that probably was independent of frequency.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I thought I'd start and ask you, you were just talking about sort of ad spends slowing. I'm wondering if you can give a sense of the -- what seasonality has to do with that. And whether the election cycle and sort of add to the cost of ad spend sort of influenced your thinking? And whether we should be thinking about sort of first quarter as likely a bigger quarter for you guys us to spend advertising, and presumably, as consequence get more impressions and prospects?","Glenn M. Renwick","Those are all issues. But I would tell you, think much more in terms of what we've already said that where we didn't have rate adequacy, we pulled back on our advertising. Certainly, there is no great reason to advertise to bring in customers if you don't think they're making a target margin. That is the biggest issue -- just think that issue. To the extent that we all know that certainly, if you live in Ohio, political advertising is a big part of what's going on, and that will come to an end here reasonably soon. Not a major factor for us. That's much more of a local buy. A good chunk of at least our television is national buys. So much more driven by our own view of do we have the rate? And if we have the rate, we'll advertise. If we don't have the rate, we'll pull back. First quarter is a big buying period for auto insurance. Always has been, always will be. So expect that the fact that we are signaling that we feel much more comfortable about our ongoing rate levels, that we are very consciously being prepared for the first quarter.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's great. The thing I'd love to get your color on related to Snapshot, is it sounds like we're making progress on sort of using it as an underwriting tool, getting than average drivers. It sounds like it's either margin neutral if not expensive. The question is, is around getting customers to pick up the phone. And it sounds like we've worked through a few different iterations. You've got something on deck. But you've got 2015, 2016, there's sort of the patent cliff as it were around sort of the window of time that you guys have to take advantage of this. And I'm just sort of wondering, is there something that you think they're working on that will ultimately be -- make this the killer app?","Glenn M. Renwick","Totally understand your question. And if you were inside Progressive, you would see the same sort of energy on everything. The fact is, we'll keep working at this with the kind of diligence that we work with everything else. Every time we get, we've got now more than 1 million customers have taken Snapshot. So it's not some sort of small data set. We learn things every time. We are learning things about the underwriting, the discount, the measurement period. So expect to see this be very dynamic in change and reflect. You mentioned this sort of cliff, that's a self-imposed cliff. We have said very clearly that we had a lot of intellectual property. In fact, our sixth patent, we've been told that our sixth patent will be awarded here very shortly. And we've been very clear to the marketplace that we're willing to license this starting the second quarter of 2015. And between that time, we'll be very clear that we don't think people should be infringing on the things that have been a significant amount of energy and work for us and have that patent protection. So we'll protect ourselves during that period of time, but we invite them to show interest in licensing if they so wish. By that time, we'll just continue to push, push, push. But this is clearly something that is very exciting. There is no question. There can be no question. This is an underwriting variable that gives us insight to driving behavior and segmentation that no other variable has given us to date, at least in the same way. How we get that through to people and how we market it is something that we're going to keep pushing at. And I wish I could get you an answer and say, \"Yes, we have got sort of the killer app in our back pocket. \" It's not likely to be that way. The more people try it, as I did note the awareness level of it, that's a pretty -- maybe I'm kidding myself, but I think that's a pretty cool thing to have more than 50% of the consuming public aware of something like this. Now, we just need to turn that awareness into action. We're going to keep plugging away at it.","Operator",".","Our next question is from Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","With applications falling down, what's the time lag until we see PIF slowdown?","Brian C. Domeck","Well, I think you've already started to see PIF growth slowdown. So and it's a combination of declines in new business and then how many of your existing policyholders retained. And as Glenn mentioned, so far, our retention levels have stayed pretty strong, but I'm certain we will see some decline just based upon rate change because this is a price-sensitive product. But in terms of rate of growth, in terms of policies in force, you've already started to see it start.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then you also, I think in the 10-Q, look like quoting and direct was down. Was that more of a function of increased rate? Or lower advertising? Or a combination of both?","Brian C. Domeck","As it relates to the quoting, that would be more relative to ad spend and response rate to ad spend. When we talk about conversion, that is more relative to how many convert into sales and that change, in terms of conversion being down, would be related to the rate changes. And it's pretty clear where we have seen most of our decrease in conversion is -- are in states where we have raised rates. So it's pretty clear. Where we have raised rates, we have seen a decline in conversion, and states where we have not had to change rates much, we haven't seen a decline in conversion at all.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then as far as Florida PIP, it looks like frequency, I think you mentioned, was down 7%, severity was down 2%. Is that due to rate and underwriting actions taken hold in the quarter, or is that just some good trend during the quarter?","Glenn M. Renwick","The frequency and severity you referenced actually was for all PIP states. But Florida, as you may or may not know, has a lot of things going off on it which was a great a number of, what I'll call, reopened PIP claims based on some district court rulings and they came at a level that was very hard for us to predict. That seems to be -- and I'm just going to say, that's more under control now. So, and we're getting a better handle on what those true costs will be. So that's less concerning. Secondarily in Florida, there have been a requirement for state -- for carriers to file a PIP adjusted rate effective -- what was it? November 1 -- or October 1. October 1, even though the rules and regulations that actually it applies to don't start until January 1. So we've taken those rate adjustments and we feel reasonably comfortable with it. But in general, we're seeing much more controlled severity in Florida PIP, but if you know anything about PIP, you don't want to make too many assessments that are too long term. So far, it seems to be a little bit quieter in the last 60 days.","Brian C. Domeck","Another state, I'd say, was a bigger PIP state and has seen a decrease in frequency is New Jersey and we've seen that for a couple of quarters now.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And one final follow-up. I think in the Q, you highlighted that favorable reserve development was mainly from 2009 and prior. What years, and I guess, what's changing those years right now?","Brian C. Domeck","Al Nees [ph],our corporate actuary's here, he can respond to that.","Unknown Executive","A large portion of the older accident years open reserves are set at policy limits, that people have a 25,000 limit and of course, those as they settle, you're not going to have any settle above that amount, so you have favorable development. So we've been adjusting our structure to compensate for that in the next coming through as favorable development.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just one question, Glenn, you mentioned just sort of claim counts -- certainly not holding you to anything. But just I'm just curious like if you were to kind of look back at Irene, what sort of claim counts did that end up -- did you end up seeing from Irene?","Glenn M. Renwick","Ooh, some [indiscernible]. Yes, it sounds about right. Know that you're catching us here without specific data, but I think we have 3 people here would know, and let's call it 7,000 or 8,000.  [indiscernible] bigger than that.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. And I'm sure from a tracking perspective, it's certainly higher. That makes sense. And that is -- that's commercial and personal, I assume, together?","Glenn M. Renwick","It is. And think of the vast majority of being, what I'd say, 6,000, say, at least 2\/3 are auto. We're going to have boat claims that are in there. And all of our other products have claims. But the vast majority are auto and commercial just in terms of unit counts because it's not a very large unit count. It's just not going to be quite as significant in terms of actual individual claims.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then I guess one question kind of emanating from your letter. Glenn, I mean you kind of talked about margin improvement. I know you look at margin, and we kind of focus on earnings and there is certainly some obvious relationship there. But as I look at cats and kind of loss trend we've seen and the rate that you're pushing now, in order to get either -- to get to ROEs that -- or even just earnings growth that makes sense kind of given your relative evaluation, I'm just trying to understand, how do you think about the levers to pull to give you either exposure growth that will lead to earnings growth down the road? Or the benefit of margin improvement from rate gains even though that doesn't come with exposure improvement? And how do you think about those and prioritize those as you manage your book?","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes, clearly, there's a lot of moving parts if you wanted to use them. But I don't want to be too dry in my answer. But we're going to try to grow our business at or better 96. And that's what drives everything for us. I'd love to think that we could count on higher investment returns, so on and so forth. You know that story as well as I do. We're going to stay the course, grow our underlying book of business and make our underwriting margin. And then under different circumstances, which right now, none of us can foresee, we may have a different proportion of earnings coming from investment income. But think of us as a \"grow as fast as possible at a 96\". And that, for me, is the common denominator that will keep us on track and we'll weather storms, whether or not the earnings from other parts of the business come in or not, that will be the one constant.","Brian C. Domeck","And the other thing I would say is just we remain committed to how we manage our capital and in terms of always needing and wanting to have sufficient capital to grow the business. And, but when we think we have more than we need for that plus contingent purposes, such as hurricanes, we will return it. And so that was a major driver for why we decided to clear the special dividend of $1. Because we want to efficiently manage our capital, which might not be your earnings question, but certainly, when you think about return on equity, it addresses that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","I just wanted to follow up on the earlier PIP discussion. I just wanted to get a little bit more as to what the puts and takes are as far as pricing and advertising versus what should be positive from things like Snapshot and the home expansion? And when I look at, I guess we do Direct first. Direct, this is the first time, at least in my numbers, that I think you've ever had 3 straight months of sequential PIP decline. And it's not the first time you ever raised rates. So I mean, why is the response been so much more dramatic even in the face of this sort of secular growth from Snapshot we've been expecting?","Glenn M. Renwick","Well, probably just size of the Direct book now, I mean, we're just not going to see the same sort of PIP growth that we may have seen when we were smaller. I understand your question, but the competition is well understood. We are fighting for every app we can get and some of our marketing initiatives. We are positive, those would be your -- the puts. But right now, the take is definitely rate. And as Brian said earlier, it's a very rate-sensitive business. So while we look forward to turning that around and having some of the initiatives, Name your Price continues to work very well for us. Snapshot, we continue to be very excited about. We like Test Drive to, volume-wise, to drive some more business. But I don't know that I can be any more specific on balancing out the puts and takes in that. Right now, the take is absolutely rate.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Okay. And then on the Agency side, it's somewhat similar. Again, I was just looking at the last time you saw a sequential quarterly decline in PIF of this magnitude was the fourth quarter of '08 when you were showing negative overall PIF growth in agency for a couple year period. I mean, does this imply we're going back to shrinking PIF in Agency until people catch up to you on price?","Glenn M. Renwick","It may. It may. But also understand that the Agency business is very elastic and with comparative raters, any changes across the board by other competitors go through very quickly for the agents. So we expect that we will get the benefit of favorable pricing as others change their prices to keep up. But impossible to know exactly when that's going to happen. In addition to that, the comments I made with regard to our penetration or our planned penetrations and more preferred book of agents with homeowners, that will be relatively small, but it will be significant for us over time.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Okay. It feels that a little bit from your comments, maybe I'm reading too much into it, but that elasticity has picked up versus prior periods when you've led the pack on rates?","Glenn M. Renwick","I wouldn't say picked up in the recent time, but picked up over a 5, 10-year period. Comparative rating and the number of apps that we get that come from comparative raters, I think in the Q, we actually tell you, we get -- we got more looks from just the mere fact that we're exposed on comparative raters. This is an issue of conversion and just rate.","Operator","And I'm currently showing no further questions. This concludes the Progressive Corporation's Investor Relations Conference Call.

You kind of talked about the personal book outside of auto and that was running at a comfortable margin -- it implied it was running at a comfortable margin, can you go into a little bit more detail in terms of what you're seeing out of the non-personal auto book and what we should expect from that as you continue to likely grow that business?","Glenn M. Renwick","Michael, you're referring to the special lines business?","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Correct.","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes, okay. There's 2 outside of auto.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","[indiscernible] not commercial, yes.","Glenn M. Renwick","The special lines business, as you know, is just a great business for us and this year -- every year has always got a story with it. This year, it was just a little bit surprising in the sense that the loss ratios ran a little softer, more favorably to margins, pretty much through the entire seasonality of the line. So it's really hard to sort of put a single issue, sometimes weather makes a really easy explanation. But I would just say there we actually had some nice favorable margin results. We don't necessarily think those will be reproduced. We feel good about our pricing, but it certainly also gives us the opportunity to be more stable with those rates going into next season. And as I indicated in my letter, while we're very, very happy with the business, we still think we can actually grow it a little faster than we've been growing the last couple of years and we've got the right rates to do that. So overall, it's just a really good story there. I'm not sure if I'm addressing your question. Commercial is a different story. And I think this is one where perhaps a little bit more what I'll call a classic play, at least we try to make it a classic play from Progressive. We get ahead of rate at least as early as anyone in the marketplace, we think. And commercial clearly started to see some trends, and John Barbagallo gave you some insight to that at the investor relations meeting some of which, frankly, we did some misses on. So we got a lot of that cleaned up in late '12, mostly in '13, with some rates, some better understanding of some underwriting requirements. And it was for that period in time mostly all hands on deck to get the profitability back to where we needed to, so we didn't get out of control there. That's rarely happened. And to some extent, as you can see in the results, that profitability has come back very nicely. We're very comfortable with that. There's probably a very few places we're not interested in pricing away the margins that we have unless there's some very good reasons do it. But there's probably some areas in our traditional sweet spot of commercial auto, which would be business auto and contractors, where we've actually got some results that we think there's room for movement there to be able to get a little bit more growth into the season coming up as we start to get into the new year. And we're making adjustments as necessary, but they're pretty much fine-tuning type of adjustments. The bigger issue on the competitive outlook there is that at least our view, what we see is the market is starting to harden. So the price actions that we took in anticipation of many of the real trends -- yes, we made a couple of mistakes as well, but many of the real trends that we price for seemed to be emerging for others. And for us, that has resulted in a stronger third quarter and we hope that will continue into the fourth and first with regard to unit growth. So the outlook on commercial really is just to fix the problems and now it's actually nice tuning and getting ready for some growth and frankly it's a good part of our business, an exciting one. Special lines is under great control. We just like to grow it a little bit more. We think we've got the rate level to enter next season set very well.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, I guess talking about the agency channel a bit. I know you made a few comments in your letter. What about Snapshot there? I mean, I know you've got 1 stated lease where you making some headway, but is it possible to offer like a reward or something to the agent specifically for integrating Snapshot? I would think that from their perspective that price is going to be very competitive for the drivers that select that product. I'm just curious, what efforts have you made or what changes have you made this year? Or do you anticipate to try and address either via Snapshot or outside that you haven't already undertaken or you hadn't undertaken in the past?","Glenn M. Renwick","Good. I appreciate that question. Yes, I did make some comments so there shouldn't be any ambiguities to how I feel about the reductions that we have seen in new business applications in the agency field. And while words are just words, the most important one is we should never be underestimated there. We have a lot of changes that we're planning to make, and I did state they won't change overnight. Let me focus on the Snapshot. I want to make sure I answer your question. And I'm going to tell you, ahead of time, I'm going to be a little more obtuse than I like to be, simply because we're hitting at a time where we're just starting to come to market and explain to others. So this is not the format to do that about the change. But I've indicated I think in at least maybe the last call and in my letter that we took some changes into the Massachusetts marketplace with Snapshot, and I'm referring specifically to agencies here, and the impacts were very favorable to us. We will release a new version of Snapshot that will be released into the marketplace late this year. December 5 is the first entry and then into next year. Now let me just spend a little time on that because I think it's important. With the amount of data that we've been able to get, now approaching 12 billion miles, we're able to do something that I consider very, very important. We're able to clearly confirm that it is an explanatory variable that can't have a proxy from 3 or 4 other variables. However, we can start to create a reasonable estimate of certain groups that we would expect to get a discount. And to the extent that we can approximate groups that we would expect -- in this case, the expected value of the discount to be within a range, we are prepared statistically to move that forward in the point of sale process. And that is largely a big part of the design that will help agents ultimately have an even more attractive price at point of sale for those people that we think will benefit from the specific driving experience as we relate that. Again, it's an independent variable and explains things on its own, but we can do those true-ups. But we will be able to make intelligent estimates based on the data that we've got today of trying to move that further forward in the process. I'm not going to say a lot more about that until we've had a chance to sort of roll that out and talk with agents and others that are affected in that process, but it's pretty exciting. So while we always knew the discount was there, it's even more exciting to be able to say, \"I think, within some reasonable certainty, I can actually give you part of it now and part of it later.\" And that sort of hedges you back. And there's a true-up process, that can happen if it's not perfect out of the gate and we're not suggesting that it'll be perfect out of the gate, but that's the purpose of having the 6-month monitoring period. That will, in my opinion, change a great deal of receptivity for the agent. So it's a little different than your suggestion of perhaps incenting the agent. Ultimately, we think, long term, the better price to the consumer is what ultimately wins in this environment. It's what the agents want, what we want, it's what the consumer wants. So we'll work primarily from that perspective. Although from time-to-time, we will do things that create a little incentive program. We've actually just come up one in the summer for our agents and those are not out of the question. But it's not what I'll call a primary play.","Operator","Our next question or comment is from Cliff Gallant from Nomura.","Clifford H. Gallant - Nomura Holdings, Inc.","I wanted to ask about the jump you saw in PIP. In the 2013 10-Q I think was a 17% jump. Do you have any insight as to what might be driving that?","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes, let's -- maybe, Gary and Brian will provide a more detailed insight into that. It's absolutely correct to see that jump off the page in the Q. It was put there to give you, certainly, a first indication of the volatility of this type of a coverage. I think we've discussed that on many occasions. I will say that this one is going to be just a little tricky to totally explain because as you know, Florida, only a year or so ago was implementing House Bill 119. There are some changes there. As the market evolves, as our procedures evolve relative to what's in emergent medical care. Obviously, the real obvious ones are broken bones, lacerations, emergency room and so on and so forth, we're fine. But there are some others where it's not as clear. So those things are settling down in the marketplace and it may be that the denominator last year was a little different than what the real run rate would be. So again, percentages can be misleading. Michigan had a rough third quarter from a weather perspective and probably had a slight difference in trend in that quarter than it's had for the year-to-date. And all I'm doing here is just meant to -- we'll always tell you what we see. But in this case, it's a convoluted picture and it very much commands our attention. But maybe Gary and Brian collectively can you give you a little bit more insight into the actual trends.","Brian C. Domeck","Yes, this is Brian. I'll try to give a little bit more color and then Gary can fill in if necessary. I think there's -- I will try to break it down into various component pieces. Certainly, as Glenn mentioned, on a quarter-over-quarter basis last year, we actually had recorded that PIP that was variable was down 4% which is sort of not necessarily the norm for the PIP coverage to see some areas going down, but some of that was driven certainly by the regulatory changes in Florida. But last third quarter was a lower-than-norm severity. Another component piece is some of the aggregate PIPs of areas explained by geographic mix differences and the PIP coverage varies greatly by individual state. The limits are not the same, et cetera. So geographic mix composition makes up some of it. And for example, we are growing more in -- and faster in Downstate New York area, Southern Florida, and also in Michigan, all of which those geographies tend to have higher severities within their -- Michigan, just in general, and then those geographies within those states. So some of it is explained by geographic mix changes and where we're growing and then what you may call sort of the underlying severity trends. And it varies actually, again, a little bit by jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, we are seeing more billings per feature. And in a few of those jurisdictions, we're actually seeing the charge per billing going up. We think the aggregate of those sort of underlying severity changes is more in the 7% range, so higher single-digit ranges. And that certainly has our attention and is higher than recent trends, but that is how I would sort of describe the various components. Some of it is low denominator, some of it is geographic mix, and then some is the base underlying what we would call base underlying severity trend. It differs a little bit by jurisdiction, but certainly, anything going up of that magnitude has our attention and we continue to dissect it. Product managers for the individual states as well as claims organizations in those states are paying great attention to it, and we're ready to react if we were to see these trends continue. But I wouldn't say 17% is the underlying severity cost. I would say the underlying severity costs are more in that 7% range, high single digits, and even that is high. So it certainly has our attention. And I think the 7% more closely probably approximates more our pace of severity trends that we're seeing in PIP. That's how I'd characterize it. Gary, if there's anything you want to add or?","Gary Traicoff","This is Gary Traicoff, Chief Actuary. I just think Brian gave a nice summary. So nothing to add to that other than we think probably that 7% range is kind of what our true underlying cost is.","William M. Cody","So those long-term followers of Progressive, the one thing that certainly has been a consistent statement we've always made is that PIP can truly be volatile and while the run rate might be considerably less than 17% and it's all a matter of your starting point, all that sort of stuff. This certainly was a, not so much a wake-up call because we're always watching it, but it certainly one that we'll be watching a great deal because PIP can get volatile quickly.","Brian C. Domeck","Yes. And just since we're on the topic of PIP, I would say, the other thing to note is that while PIP frequency and aggregate PIP is down, there are some jurisdictions, principally Florida, where we are starting to see an increase in PIP frequency and that covers all the geographies throughout the state for the most part. So PIP is very much a state-by-state view and different sort of outcomes in each of those states. But Florida, from both the frequency going up as well as seeing severity going up as well as some of the changes that are in the marketplace as a result, House Bill 119 in Florida very much has our attention these days.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I think you did a great job of being accurate but obtuse on the first question about your Massachusetts product, but I wanted to ask you a couple of follow-ups, if I may, on that. So it sounds like that we're going to get a new version of Snapshot starts going in December 5. When do you think we should -- when should we expect it to be rolled out nationally? Is it -- are these going to be agency-only changes? Or do they go into direct? And I'm wondering, I mean, I recognize you're going to be circumspect about this, but what can you tell us about what you'll be looking for, say, for this, your quote volume and close rates for making a switch to the product?","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes. Let me see if I can hit most of those. Both channels. So the changes would reflect both channels. Some of the changes are the sorts of things, and you certainly have had at least as much interest in this as anyone so you'll appreciate it. The algorithms are always, always maturing. In fact, I will be obtuse here in terms of what we're looking at. But I sort of get -- it just feels really cool to me that we're now able to look at things that sort of would have seemed just totally ridiculous to think about few years ago. The kinds of things that we can see in the data, the regularity of certain behaviors that we wouldn't necessarily have even dreamed about a few years ago, we now actually can see and test those hypothesis. So the algorithm is just getting richer. That will be consistent in both channels. To the extent that we have already experienced a very different take rate in direct and agency, what I'm hoping for is that moving the -- or some part of the discount further forward will have a more dramatic effect in agency than it will in direct. I may be wrong on that, it may have equal effect in both channels, but for me the biggest thing is that it does have some effect in the agency channel. That's what we'll be looking for. So from your continuous study of this, you should be thinking about this as how are we maturing the product based on data. Because some of the things we could have done a long time ago but you wouldn't have nearly the certainty that you're headed in the right direction based on the data that we have today and then just the continuous evolution of our algorithm which will only continue to get richer as we put in even more features, including GPS into the Snapshot device which we have -- they had previous experience with but will actually use that more aggressively in the next several years.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's helpful, Glenn. Separately, I wonder if you can give us an update how you guys are thinking about your many... I'm sorry, go ahead.","Glenn M. Renwick","I'm sorry, I missed your first -- the rollout will be starting in December, but first quarter will pick up momentum for many states and then we'll just keep the rollout going.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Oh, great. I thought I was going to have to ask that one offline. So if -- just a quick one. Give us your thoughts on your mobile strategy as it relates to Snapshot. Obviously, there's a major competitor of yours who's now making a bit more noise about their 16 states. They have a mobile product UBI app launched. We all know you guys have had a beta test of the Snapshot iPhone app, but I don't think we've seen anything -- seen you guys launch anything widespread. And I guess, I'm curious, if you could help me understand, is this a sign of you guys making a different technology bet? Are others getting ahead in the sort of the arms race here? Or should we just stay tuned?","Glenn M. Renwick","No, I can comment a little bit on that. Obviously, the chip is a great way to be sure that it's that vehicle and so on and so forth and we're much more comfortable with that as a reliable data set. I think I've said on numerous occasions, I would be just as happy to get out of the business of plugging things into cars. That's not really an integral part of our business. And as cars become moving IP addresses, that will happen. And we are very much, as you would -- could reasonably assume, very much in sync with the manufacturers that are making those kind of changes so that we will be there when that's available. But being out of the dongle business, that's okay by me. The interim of a iPhone or Android device, yes, you're right, we've had that. We obviously, therefore, match it against other data that we feel is reliable and we continually try to find something that we would be as comfortable that the proxy data from a device that may or may not be in the car at the time. It's the same device that's in your pocket when you're landing an aircraft. You're going to get data, but it won't relate to the driving experience. So it's not quite as simple as it would seem. And now we also have other vendors that we've invited to actually participate in a, I would say, a bake-off a little bit to see who can actually do even better than we may have done. So we're very interested in mobile devices. We are not sort of folding the tent on that one, but we're also not going to go with something where we think the approximation to data isn't as good as what we can get barring another source. When that threshold is crossed at some reasonable point, that would be another arrow in our quiver, so to speak.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from James Engle from John W. Bristol & Co.","James Allyn Engle - John W. Bristol & Co., Inc.","My question is on policy life expectancy. It looks like for 12 months, agent was flat and direct was up 6%. And for 3 months, agent was down 6% whereas direct was up 1%. Could you give us some color on that? And also, could you weave in what's going on with Progressive Home Advantage?","Brian C. Domeck","Yes, I'll first give some color on the PLEs and then I'll turn it over to Glenn to describe what's going on in the PHA program. You're right in terms of the numbers and the changes. We're seeing PLE growth continued in the direct channel and starting to see some degradation in the agency channel. It used to be that direct and agency PLEs were roughly about the same and now the direct channel has a few months higher average PLE than the agency channel is. And some of the degradation we'd see in the agency channel relates to a decrease in some of our renewal rates and some of that has been more recent, so that's why it's showing up more in the trailing 3 months rather than the trailing 12-month measure I'd indicated in May, that the 3-month uses more recent data. And I would say a lot of the change or a fair amount of change in the agency PLE is due to actually a little bit decrease in our renewal retention rates whereas we've seen some in the direct channel but not nearly as much. And part of why -- one of the things that is helping with the direct channel PLE is we continue to get more of our policies to have more than one product, and in fact that's a lot of strategy of the PHA program and the bundling there, and we're continuing to grow the percentage of policies in both channels that have that. But obviously, we're growing more in the direct channel. Glenn might want to share some more details about what's going on in the PHA?","Glenn M. Renwick","Sure. I think there's maybe 5 points to touch on since most of you know the broad details there. It's all about getting multi-policy households and that is effectively continuing to go up. These are not massive increases on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but it's a great trend and we're very happy with that. We did add our 12th carrier to our PHA program in the last quarter and probably more important than any of those things is ultimately the issue of are we really bundling. So it's one thing to sell a product, but the real question is we were trying to sell bundles of home and auto, and the best measure of that probably we get the cleanest measure from our direct channel. And you could just think about 3\/4 of the home and auto are bundled together of those customers. So while we will sell a home policy or a renter's policy, and it may not be with the auto at same time or vice versa, about 3\/4 of those policy holders are households ultimately end up bundling. Now the development that will discontinue to take on more and more strength would be our in-house agency where we have relationships with some of the carriers that we offer a homeowner's product to our customers. I'll touch renters in a second, because that's a little bit different. We have, historically, been able to do that in an online mode or perhaps we will actually refer in some cases a customer back to our partner and their call center. We are now adopting more and more holding the quoting relationship inside Progressive and being able to make sure that we use the breadth of companies that we represent. If it's not possible on online mode, then we'll have an in-house agency that will be able to provide the best product. And it may not be as one-to-one, it may be that we have the whole resource of the 12 carriers available or some number of those 12. So the in-house agency is proceeding and growing. And the fifth point I'd make in that arena is the renter's product that we've just taken to marketplace. I think I've said, if I haven't then I'll say now, our aspirations on renters are not about significant premiums, but really getting people stickier with us and having that second product be a very valuable product at an earlier part of their insurance cycle that ultimately leads to the PHA. So we were happy. There's not a lot to report on the renters at this point in time. I think we'll have a lot more to say when we get together in our IR meeting in mid-year next year. Good stuff across the board. And it's still I probably should say it's certainly a place where growth rates for our PHA-type program, which typically is highly aligned with more preferred, growth rates barring excess of anything you see printed as the aggregate. So this is a significant growth part of our business.","James Allyn Engle - John W. Bristol & Co., Inc.","Is ASI still the only carrier with agents?","Glenn M. Renwick","Correct. Yes, with agents it gets considerably trickier to have more than one. But more importantly than that, we have just a terrific relationship with ASI, and are very happy with them and will continue to work with them. And there are probably things that we, again, we can talk about this time or our IR meeting next year, but there are opportunities for us to do some things with ASI that I think would be quite exciting.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","A year ago, we were talking a lot about medical cost inflation and the effects of the reforms there. Now it's a ways out, are there any lessons learned? Did we see anything that affected -- in your medical cost trends, that were affected by those reforms or did it become just sort of a nonissue?","Glenn M. Renwick","Paul, I'm going to refer this to -- there's a couple of folks in the room. So I don't see anybody with a hand in the air with something important to say. So I think that -- and I mean that in a light way, I think that there's nothing that we can sort of pull out that says, \"Hey, here is the one thing you can take away from the accountable care act and how its trickled through to our costs. And if you look at the very macro level, while I'm sure on a couple of calls maybe earlier this year I've talked about BI trend which is one that I tend to watch a lot more, maybe 3 to 5. I think you might strengthen that 4 to 6, but I don't know that we can relate that to the accountable care act or any form of reform. The bigger issue that Brian went into in some detail in PIP, I don't think you can sort of relate that to the medical card. That's much more specific to the individual state issues. So I would say nothing dramatic and any small effects, they're never going to be noticeable or detectable.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Vinay Misquith from Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just want to follow up on the homeowners on the agency side. Glenn, why, in your opinion, do you think that the traction is not as strong bundling products on the agency side? And so is it that the branding of the homeowners needs to be better? Do customers prefer, I mean, a joint highly-branded product for the homeowners and the auto together, or is it something else?","Glenn M. Renwick","No. I think we've just got some opportunities to really make our bundle work even better than it does today. So the acceptance with some agents is actually very strong. There's no question. This is a place where, unlike most things, we're the ones that are coming into the market a little bit later than some established carriers. But we've got to break in and we've got to make our presence meaningful. I think we've got every ability to do that, but that's not going to be one that we turn around instantaneously. But I would say actually we're gaining with agents on a regular basis and I sort of alluded, and that's all I'm going to do at this point, I think there's a lot more that we can do with ASI to really make our products very attractive as an even more integrated bundle. I like to think of this as not so much 2 products, but starting to sort of present at least to the consumer that this is just the insurance you need. It's sort of our problem to figure out which part of it falls into which line of insurance. And the more we can do that and make this a more viable consumer proposition, I think that's going to be our strength to market and strength with the agents. So being a little bit circuitous on your answer, I don't see any major roadblock there. In fact, agents have accepted this, consumers have accepted it. We need agents to accept it even more willingly. And I think the biggest issue there is they have options. And many of those options are good options. So let's just be realistic about that. We need to come to market with continuously better ones.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure. And do you think the commission rate for the agents is maybe a stumbling block? And would you consider raising the commission rate for the agents?","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes, it's a little bit of a stumbling block only in the sense that others will pay more, and not so much that we think we're wrong and there are 2 parties to pay the commission. While I'm not going to get out over our skis too much, what we can consider other options, everything can be on the table as we think about a bundle that comes to market where we really, really want to play in this marketplace, but assume that, that will be part of something more comprehensive as opposed to just a tactical reaction to market commissions.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And the last thing, just a follow-up. On the order side, you're doing pretty well in terms of margins. Curious as to whether you see the PIP growth issue as a margin issue whereby you can maybe lower price a little bit? Or do you think it's more to do outside of margins and therefore you would rather just keep your margins where they are?","Glenn M. Renwick","We have our target margins. We're very clear about that. You know what those are and when we do better than that, that's good. We acknowledge it. The thing that is always tricky and very easy to see from a macro level is why don't you turn the switch and put it a little bit here, increase growth is not quite that simple. I would just tell you, you should assume that, I for one, am not willing to give away margin unless there is a more than proportionate growth to be had. But in general, as we've said all along, we want to grow as fast as possible at or better than our target margins. So while we're reporting sort of 92 and change year-to-date and for the quarter, we've also given you some indication that there are some trends and severity that are starting to outstrip the frequency declines. So for me, my general outlook and this is very general because states are specific, we have a rate level that can stay in place for a while longer without dramatic change. And that's always a good thing for a consumer versus up and down. So I think we're well positioned as we go into the remaining part of this year, and most importantly, well positioned for the bigger season in the first quarter next year.","Operator","Our next question or comment is from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You mentioned that your biggest business opportunity is in the Robinsons consumer segment with bundled products. I just wonder, given the development in the reinsurance market was alternative capital coming in, have you considered that actually putting homeowners business on your own balance sheet that you can actually transfer some of the volatility while sort of basically growing your customer base?","Glenn M. Renwick","Kai, not directly. And while if we would ever do something like that, you could reasonably assume there would be fair amount of reinsurance, I also don't overly pick a strategy based on markets that are available today but may or may not be at a different point in time. We will always consider our long-term strategy of being a destination insurer there will almost unquestionably be things we will do over the next several of years. But I'd much rather tell you what those are when we do them. But I wouldn't be jumping to any conclusions about writing homeowners in our paper.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's great. Then on capital management, if you consider you have operating earnings about $900 billion -- $900 million each year and then how much of that would you say you need to retain for your future business growth versus than what's priority for the variable annual dividends or special dividends this year?","Glenn M. Renwick","I'll let Brian take that one.","Brian C. Domeck","In terms of how much do we need for growth, we try to target insurance underwriting companies at a 3:1 premium-to-surplus ratio. In most jurisdictions we have that ability. We also have some additional capital at some noninsurance companies. But for the premium growth that we're talking about, and let's call it $1 billion a year or slightly more than $1 billion dollar a year, you might need $400 million of capital for the growth, $350 million or $400 million for the growth at that 3:1 sort of ratio. Then obviously, in terms of our capital management structure, we have the variable annual dividend which is certainly formulaic and it's 1\/3 of the aftertax underwriting profit times our gain share. So that amount for the variable dividend obviously can change each and every year based upon both the underwriting margin as well as the gain share factor. I can just let people know as of September month end, if you were trying to calculate what the variable dividend through 3 quarters is, based upon our underwriting profit and our gain share factor, it would be about $0.49 per share based upon 2 or 3 quarters of activity. Obviously, we have the fourth quarter underwriting profit to go and the gain share factor will be finalized in December. But you can calculate the magnitude of the variable dividend based upon that. But those 2 components, the growth, $350 million to $400 million plus the variable dividend, which can change every year. And then, after that, then we have the opportunities for both share repurchases. And so far this year, we've repurchased around $235 million worth of shares. And then, we still believe our current capital position is strong but we feel good about that. It gives us opportunities that we choose to in terms of continuing the share repurchases and then consider other alternatives.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just finally, what's your cash -- holding company cash utilization at quarter end?","Glenn M. Renwick","Bill, the picky assets at the end of the third quarter were $1.3 billion?","William M. Cody","Yes.","Glenn M. Renwick","And that can act just like cash but the assets held out at picky are $1.3 billion.","Operator","Our next question or comment is from Mike Zaremski from Balyasny.","Michael Zaremski","My first question is on the expense ratio. If I look, it's been slowly but surely turning down over the years and I'm aware if we go back many years the ratio has been at 20% before, but can you elaborate on what's been driving this reduction so we can better understand if it's -- it can continue or potentially reverse?","Glenn M. Renwick","Sure. Brian, jump in on this one, as well. I think, as we talk about the expense ratio, let's break at least for direct, or well for both I think is fine, into 2 pieces: acquisition and non-acquisition expense ratio. I think that's an important distinction to make. Acquisition, as you know, for agency is primarily commissions and we've been stable there for some period of time. Don't expect any major changes there. So that's a function really of earned premium. And on the direct side, we will spend, and we've gone through this discussion several times, we will spend what makes most sense relative to the yield that we see. So yes, that could go up faster than our premium under certain circumstances, but that would be based on good business judgment. The non-acquisition expense ratio you should reasonably assume has a great deal of management oversight that says we would need a really good reason to grow any expense faster than earn premium. So we should be able to continue to keep our expense ratio very much in the levels that you're seeing, at least, on the non-acquisition expense ratio. Something like benefits, not quite as controllable and may not necessarily be a direct function of earned premium, but we can control things like salaries, headcounts, certainly premium taxes, those sorts of things. So while you've seen that go down over time, that's been a very deliberate action for us to get to something closer to the run rate expense ratios that you're now seeing on a pretty consistent basis and that the trend being a favorable trend. The biggest change that we will likely be able to bring about in our expense ratio will be continuing to increase policy life expectancy and having more and more of our customers with multiple products. That denominator effect, if you like, or scale effect, is the one that will give us the next quantum. But the active management, which has been going on for some time, to control non-acquisition expense ratio has frankly been extremely positive and got us to a level that we feel very comfortable is sustainable. But for some really exogenous event like benefits costs or something like that which is not likely to move the needle significantly anyway. Brian, anything in that...?","Brian C. Domeck","No. I think just a conscious focus internally to try to keep what we call the non-acquisition costs growing at less than earned premium growth. And I don't think we're going to change that view or philosophy any time soon. I think it's going to continue to be a focus. We know that has an influence on the competitiveness of our rates in the marketplace, which ultimately is how we win. So I think we've done a nice job in recent years. And I don't think there's going to be any letup in there. As Glenn mentioned, the advertising and how much you spend on advertising is a function of how much we think we can spend relative to the yield. And on that front, if we see greater and increased opportunities, we'd be more than willing to send more money on the advertising side and that requires us to keep a focus on all those other costs which we are and we'll continue to do that.","Michael Zaremski","On the ad spend, are there any separate trends there in terms of ad spend getting more or less expensive kind of an absolute basis when you occupy the Internet or Internet ad spend with Facebook and Google versus the TV networks. Is there anything at play there?","Glenn M. Renwick","Well, certainly in terms of our media mix, it certainly is changing in terms of more of the increase in advertising spend, would be more web-based, social media, et cetera, versus maybe TV per se, although TV still is a very, very large component of our media mix. And I would just say that, in general, we continue to see cost per impressions, CPMs, that media outlets charges continually going up a little bit. And I don't see that necessarily going down, but that's more of a function of supply and demand in the marketplace, but currently certainly CPMs are going up -- still going up a little bit.","Michael Zaremski","Okay, great. And lastly as a follow-up, Glenn, to you commentary about, if I understood it correctly, you're offering certain agency customers a discount based on data you've learned from Snapshot, what percentage of the population of the drivers could the discount you're speaking of pertain to? I know you want to be reserved, but just hoping to get a sense of whether that could impact a large or small population of your agency quotes.","Glenn M. Renwick","Actually, the discount will apply to both direct and agency. I just indicated that I think it'll have a little bit more of a marketable effect in the agency environment. So just to clarify that. I'd call it large because it just won't be the same discount for every customer. So there's that kind of notion I went through earlier of expected value. So there will be a large percentage of customers be able to get some form of discount advanced through the point of sale. And in some cases, it might be a larger discount. In some cases, it's smaller. But the number that will likely get some part of the expected discount advanced will actually be significant. And we see numbers far in excess -- and you've sort of seen this, we're not giving out the exact numbers but our indications are that far in excess of 50%, 60% sort of individuals are deserving of the discount that only Snapshot and driving behavior can identify. So those haven't changed.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Capital.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","How are you dealing in a low interest rate world from an investment perspective? If I look at your 10-Q, this may be totally unrelated, but it looks like you sold governments and munis in the quarter and rerisked in corporate RMBSs, in particular AMBSs, which is consistent with the sort of the opposite direction of how they moved in the second quarter, third quarter, so it makes some sense. But is the strategy to rerisk to get more yield, do you think rates are going to stay low for longer than maybe you would articulate it at the last couple of meetings in public? Where are you on the investment portfolio overall?","Glenn M. Renwick","Sure. Bill, why don't you take that?","William M. Cody","Yes, sure. The strategy stays the same as far as trying to protect our capital and focus on total return. And as you've pointed out, during the quarter, we do make moves in the portfolio that are based on value. So we added some ABS, some short ABS which used some cash and some short treasuries for us because they offered us a little bit better yield and a lot of safety. So not high-yielding assets but better than cash and short treasuries. Munis, we sold a little bit because they had runs really far and for us, as a corporate taxpayer in some instances, we're able to sell them at relatively flat yield to the Treasury, so if you can sell a credit product at almost Treasury yields, you should do that. And the corporate market where we sold earlier in the year is that same sort of situation where spreads have tightened pretty sharply to the point where, in some cases, they didn't represent good value to us. We reversed that a little bit in the third quarter as spreads widened particularly in the high-yield market where we're able to add some paper at, we thought were attractive spreads. So unfortunately, we have to operate in the market that we're operating in. What we're trying to do is keep it in the fairway and maintain flexibility. Where we find some opportunities, we'll put some money to work. And where we find some opportunities to sell, because pricing has gotten, in our point of view, way too aggressive, we'll sell. On the duration front, yes, we do think that rates will rise. I think the U.S. economy is doing well. And the Fed just announced yesterday that they will end their 2-week program now and -- or at the end of the month and there's a lot of speculation as to whether or not they raise rates in the third quarter or fourth quarter next year. And that, whether it's one quarter or another is less relevant to us than the overall direction. And our view is that rates will go up as the economy does better and we'll have a better opportunity to spend duration and take some duration risk and get paid a little bit more for doing that.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","How long have you had that view that rates are going to go higher, Bill?","William M. Cody","It's been a long time. Now it didn't pay off for us last year but, yes, it's been a while.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Now it seems like your tactical moves have been really good particularly in the equity side, but the view, I mean, you're with the consensus that rates are going higher and that hasn't seemed to work, but you're going to stick with that position from here. And the last question is to what extent does your view on interest rate layer into the actuary's view on less cost severity. I mean, is there an integrated strategy on the asset liability side of the balance sheet on what inflation could it be? Or do you operate more independently, which is the case for most insurance companies?","Gary Traicoff","This is Gary, Chief Actuary. We operate more independently. We're truly looking at the medical and the inflation cost would come in. Obviously, everybody knows what interest rates are, but we're really kind of independent of that.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So on the liability side, you could have a view that inflation won't be that bad, isn't consistent with the investment side if possible. I mean, I know you're looking at a more micro level than Bill is, but they do interact to some extent.","Gary Traicoff","Yes, what we're going to look at countrywide, obviously, medical costs, CPI costs, things like that. So that does come into play somewhat, but not necessarily what the interest rates are doing.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Brian C. Domeck","This is Brian. I just want to clarify, at least, maybe some of my earlier statements relating to capital and how much capital is required. I referenced $1 billion of premium growth, that's approximately what our premium growth has been in the last year. So use that as an example as opposed to saying that's actually what our premium growth will always be. I used that as an example, so I just want to clarify that one.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Arash Soleimani from KBW.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just had a follow-up question on the Florida PIP comments earlier. Just curious if you have any thoughts on how the outcome of the upcoming governor's election could impact your PIP severity, if at all ongoing forward?","Glenn M. Renwick","I don't, and I'm sorry. I'd like to be as helpful, but I simply don't. I don't think that's going to change most of what House Bill 119 was all about and how that's being interpreted and reinterpreted through the quote systems. That would be -- that's beyond my paygrade.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's fair, just thought I would ask.","Brian C. Domeck","I would echo Glenn's comments.","Operator","And our last question at this time comes from David Small from JPMorgan.","David Small","Yes. Could you just give us some more color about the growth challenges that you're seeing in the agency channel? Maybe just talk about competitive behavior and why you think you've been struggling to grow.","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes. We do a lot of decomposition and I'll try to give some color here to be responsive to the question without absolute specifics, but we decomp that. We know some part of it is rate, some part of it is actually some underwriting actions that we have taken, and that will stabilize over time and frankly we're okay with that. But that's a small piece of it. There is clearly some changes in receptivity to some of the more aggregators that we talked about last time on the call. That's a piece of it. But let's not suggest that it's not partly and significantly the competitive environment. We've seen some results from competitors. I'm sure you've seen them. But I'd suggest that they are getting some significant pickup in new business in some cases after a period of not doing quite as well. So it's a competitive environment, one that we've played in for lots of years and we will respond. We will respond, however, without breaking our discipline around what we've always said, we'll go as fast as possible at our target margins. Frankly, I sit here. I was comfortable making the statements that I make. This is not what I like. We've got so much of the business working really well. We've got some new things that we are not ripe to talk about yet, but our agency production in new business is probably the one place that prevented this quarter being an even better quarter because it was pretty good. But we're on it, and there's no question. This is, in the trenches, competition in the agency channel and we've got to come at that with our best tools, new products, new Snapshot design, some multiproduct news with our homeowners partner. All of those things are absolutely happening and as I did indicate in my letter, don't -- those are not things to sort of Tuesday next week it will be turned around, but as we go into '16 -- or '15, excuse me, I think we'll be even better positioned.","David Small","Just a follow-up. Do you think that your competitive position with any average agency has changed given the moves that your competitors have made just in terms of the where you're priced relative to peers or other metrics that you look at?","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes, I think -- yes, that would be the conclusion I drew because, frankly, we've changed less and then the very early part of the year we were clucking along at some very different rates. So the only way that really happens is if someone comes and introduces some variable, i.e. a price point, that is lower. And we may or may not be prepared to match that price point, but it's not quite that simple. It's more complex. But yes, I'd say the competitive environment has absolutely tried to change our position, our conversion rate in individual agents.","Matt Downing","I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call.

That's up from 30,000 in more recent years. Have the new agencies been a driver of the PIP growth? And I was curious also what your penetration rate is among independent agencies.","Glenn M. Renwick","Mike, unfortunately, the answer's probably not a significant driver of growth. We obviously know agencies, agents, and we've always sort of held to a number that we could reasonably represent was a fair representation. But every so often, we take a more detailed census, and this is our change, our formal change to report. It's now -- 35,000 is more representative than 30,000, which we used for a long time. So it's a little bit more of a consistent PI change, and not representing a sudden shift or a sudden increase in agents. So no to the driver of additional volume, but our independent Agency channel, overall, has actually been doing quite nicely, so we're happy with that. But don't focus too much on the change of number. You'll see that number going forward as a much more representative number in our PR and general releases.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And lastly, policy life expectancy had -- has been decreasing in Direct despite Snapshot and Home Advantage, which I believe are bigger contributors in that channel. Could you talk about that, and also what the driver of the increased life expectancy in Agency has been -- what's been behind that?","Glenn M. Renwick","Sure. PHA and Snapshot both remained positive, so unfortunately, when you have questions like this, it tends to be little pieces of data and sometimes hard to connect the dots, so I'll try to do that as best I can. We had taken a significant -- and we talked about this in past calls -- significant rating action in Florida. Now I point out one state, and that -- you might say, \"Well, just one state.\" Florida represents a significant chunk of our business, and therefore, it does matter. When those rate changes take place, which are very -- unfortunately, very necessary, they have a delayed effect on future renewals. And a large piece of the retrenchment on PLE, which we are certainly not happy with, is a result of our rate changes -- our necessary rate changes in Florida. We have sort of beaten ourselves up quite appropriately to see if there was anything that we were doing internally. And frankly, there were a few things that we were doing internally that also were destructive to our PLE. A couple of those were more specific to Direct than they were to Agency. So the results are as we report them, but I don't sense any systemic issue or major change between Direct or Agency. And as long as our rate levels remain adequate for, certainly our large states, I would expect to see those stats to reverse themselves and come back to the levels that they were at. That's not a -- anything other than my expectation, but the reason for the decline, primarily, a price shock. A little bit more accentuated in Direct, where we also had some things that we needed to fix with regard to build plans and some what we call onboarding activities, where we bring new customers onboard. Some things that we could do considerably better. All of those are either remediated or very close to remediation.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And the -- and since you brought up Florida, the bills in the Florida House regarding PIP, and the Senate, would those be good for auto insurers like Progressive?","Glenn M. Renwick","Though it's somewhat dangerous, I've made a career out of not speculating on political issues, but it's a very fair question. Florida PIP is not irrelevant relative to the state of the industry right now. So I'll say a couple of things. The House bill, I think, has more potential, from our perspective. Obviously, the people of Florida, the legislature will have to choose to do whatever they do. We do not tend to get particularly involved in legislative affairs. We offer our opinion and our experience and data where asked. The Senate bill does not do nearly as much as the House bill. And Florida has, since the Third and Fourth District Court ruling, changed a level of understanding of reimbursement for PIP that we thought was well expressed by the legislature in 2008, though now with these court rulings, something other than that, which is causing some degree of disruption. And frankly, we had made some moves to incorporate some language in our policy contract that we think puts us in a relatively better position than many. But the likelihood of reform, I'm not even going to give you a probability on that. I would tell you that if the House bill were the one to be ratified by the Senate [ph] and the Governor, then that would be more useful to us than the Senate bill.","Brian C. Domeck","Mike, this is Brian. You had also asked a little bit about the drivers of the Agency policy life expectancy increasing. There's a number of reasons, but one of the reasons would be we were actually getting more quoting activity in the preferred market or subset of policyholders that have a tendency and norm to stay with us longer. So that is, for us, a very good thing. And our agents are now quoting us more for those preferred-type risks.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My question relates -- I'm trying to figure out how good of a selector Snapshot is. I was wondering if you have any data you can share with us about the propensity or proportion of accidents -- 6-month customers or 1-year customers or 2-year customers -- what percentage of your accidents that you guys know come from new customers as opposed to legacy customers?","Glenn M. Renwick","Josh, that is very knowable. I don't know that at the level of specificity I'd be comfortable answering right now. I'll tell you what, we will almost certainly be talking about Snapshot in a meaningful way at our next meeting. And so while you can reasonably assume, as we have -- we and others have indicated that new business loss ratios typically exceed the renewal loss ratios, and therefore, there is a propensity for higher frequency in the first term on the policy. But all of that's just rhetoric. I think that can be answered a little bit more specifically, and frankly, it's a reasonable question. So why don't we sort of take note of that and defer that to June, when I could give you a bit more of an answer that would be of some value to you.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Let me try and ask it in another way which is less -- more direct. It seems that this quarter, Progressive opened up a pretty wide gap in terms of underwriting profitability compared with the competitors, yet we assume the average Snapshot customer is probably a lower-premium-per-policy customer than the average general pool customer. What might -- if you guys wanted to speculate, what might be accounting for this?","Glenn M. Renwick","Okay, all right. Perhaps I was looking for the statistical answer to your other one as opposed to general. Let me try to give you...","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I will take it, by the way, if you have it.","Glenn M. Renwick","Well, we have it. I just didn't have it top of mind. Let me try to answer your question, but give you several different points that are valuable. I think it's a little dangerous to jump to most recently reported results and use one explanation for their -- the deltas. I mean, I see the industry results as well as you do. Let me tell you one of the most important things that is happening with Snapshot. First of all, our units that we're shipping in Snapshot continue to increase. We have not seen a plateauing of that. So this is not, as in some cases, we come up and others come up with ideas that seem good, but they don't really hunt. Clearly, Snapshot is something that is definitely commercial grade. There's no question about that in terms of the units that we're shipping, the customers showing interest and the percent of new customers that this is affecting, specifically in Direct, and with the slight climb now in Agency. And I mentioned some of that in my letter. The most important thing to me is that the loss results match with the pricing. Your assessment that, frankly, we are giving relatively large discounts is an important assessment. It is extremely dangerous to give large discounts unless you have a very high certainty that you're matching the true loss costs. So now that we've developed a reasonable track record, and there has been some tuning -- but I would say tuning, not sort of mega-refinement -- to our discount structure, we are becoming very comfortable that we are matching our loss results with the pure -- or the pure premium is being matched, and things look good there. So we will continue. As you will see in some of our other statistics, it is possible that average premiums will decline for a little bit. The issue is are we matching the loss costs with our price. Answer so far, and so far is a reasonably good measure, yes. Are we seeing other things that we hope to get from that? The customers that are coming to us are disproportionately relative to other non-UBI -- and I called UBI here as Snapshot, usage-based insurance. They typically have prior insurance. We are seeing a grouping of customers who typically get higher levels of discounts tend to be -- or tend to have a higher propensity to come from carriers that are, let's just say, the 3 that are larger than us. We will get a higher percentage of those customers in the higher-discount tiers than we might in the lower-discount tiers or in non-usage space. We have now credible data that those who come to us through Snapshot and get a discount are experiencing a meaningful increase in retention. We're not going to give out those specific numbers, but when I say meaningful, it's not 10 basis points. ","We're finding that our advertising that we had -- actually, I'll say we even struggled a little bit in our earliest versions of advertising to try to get people to understand what the Snapshot concept was and the relative ease with which they could install the unit. We've probably had a couple that were not as effective. Two of our more recent commercials have helped with that a great deal, and a lot of the mystery and sort of concern seems to have gone away. A couple other things that I can throw in as -- since Snapshot surely is on people's mind is that the algorithm -- and I tried to reference some of this in my shareholders letter, the algorithm will continually be a work in progress for us. Obviously, we don't change it all the time, but we're always doing R&D to figure out new things. And it is very clear to us that more data, a better ability to analyze it, different uses of the components that we can now measure -- we mentioned some of those at the last IR meeting -- are actually going to contribute to a revised algorithm in the future. And I suspect that, that will continue for quite some time, as we get to use this data in more and more intelligent ways. We've also referenced in the shareholder letter that the intellectual property that we have has been reviewed and upheld at the patent office, including the issuance of a further patent, which is very, very directly describing what we're doing in the marketplace. So we're very thrilled with that. So Snapshot, in general, is working very well, and I'd say it's commercial grade. And loss results have matched with the pricing, and that gives us a great deal of confidence to keep pushing on this.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Heimmermann with JPMC.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess just on Snapshot, and I apologize if you've covered this before, but can you give us a -- and this is really following up on the letter where you talked about kind of the Agency distribution having kind of embraced this at a lesser rate than Direct customers. But I would just be curious, this -- is the Snapshot customer a customer that is predisposed to be a Direct customer more so than an Agency customer? I'm just trying to think about if that customer is more likely to be a Direct customer, is -- does that mean they're more likely to be somebody who would be attractive to Progressive anyways? I'm just trying to think about that dynamic as we think about the penetration of the product over time.","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes, that's a good question. I think that calls for some speculation, which in this case I'll give you mine, and that's what it is, so... I don't think the customer per se is necessarily someone who has a proclivity for one distribution or another. Most people want to be rated in their insurance for sort of who they are and how their driving behaviors reflect or could reflect in the premium. So I really don't sense that there's a structural reason why somebody would feel differently if they went to an agent versus direct as to their personal comfort with having their insurance rate reflect their driving behavior. I think that's pretty much uniform. Why -- the reason I made the comment I made, and having had a lot of years with agents is recognizing that as small business people, changes come to them. Some stick, some don't stick. I think agents in general -- and actually sort of probably would put myself in this category if I were one of them -- I want to see something get a little bit more of a permanency and a maturity to it before I put that on my customers, knowing that I'm the one that has to go back later and say \"Oh no, it didn't work. The company changed their minds,\" and I have to rewrite or do whatever.\" So I think there is a period where agents want to just get a greater confidence that this is something that they can rely on, and that they can offer to their customers with some degree of certainty that it's going to be in place for a period of time. Our ability to do that and use our Direct channel as a leading indicator to test that and prove that proposition is actually terrific, because then we can go back to agents and sort of say \"Hey, look, here's our data. I think you can start to feel a little more confident.\" And we're already starting to see -- it's still small, but as I predicted, and I'm happy to give you meaningful updates without necessarily specific percentages as the year develops, but I'll be surprised if we don't see the Agency adoption of this somewhat come up to parallel the Direct adoption simply because it's really a consumer benefit and doesn't have specifics to distributions.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then the other issue I was trying to get my arms around was just around the Home Advantage product, from the standpoint -- and I don't if this works to your benefit or detriment or maybe it doesn't matter. But obviously, Homeowners is now -- from an industry perspective is seeing a ton of pricing pressure. And it doesn't look like this is likely to be a one-year phenomenon, as a lot of folks in the industry feel like the product is structurally underpriced and the CAT experience of last year and late 2010 have probably weighed on that a bit. So I guess my question is, we -- your providers, do you get -- do you feel like what they're likely to do on the rate side is going to be in line with the industry or more or less aggressive? And how do you see their relative rate need or actions affecting the take-up rate for that product for the preferred customer, multiproduct customer?","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes. The carriers that we work with were all -- none of them were immune to the issues from last year, period. It'd be silly to suggest otherwise. However, to a degree I think that they were probably on the lesser side of that, which is nice for them. And they will need to react. That's clearly their decision to make, but they will need to react. And in fact, if we go back to the very first question that was asked about Direct and a little bit of policy life expectancy, there's probably a touch in there where we've seen some rate increases for our PHA that has changed their relationship in auto. So this is not something that is -- not intertwined, but all of our carriers are on top of it. We get nothing from them that suggests that they are any more concerned than any other reasonable homeowners company. And while they're taking some rate need, it looks like in all cases we have open and viable markets. And the good here relative to being able to offer that is far greater than the concern around rate. In fact, I want them to take rate because they're no use to me if they're not viable and profitable in meeting their own standards. And what's probably more important is that, frankly, you're going to see a lot of customers experience changes in their homeowners rates, which is potentially another shock that forces people into the marketplace in general to shop. So while there is some negative on the balance sheet here, there's actually a fair amount of positive from our perspective that we have multiple carriers. They're all open for business. In fact, we've added a couple of carriers, and we'll talk about that later. And our PHA strategy continues for us to be a very viable strategy. It continues to open up more of that preferred customer coming in through Direct and where we can offer it, through agents. Brian already mentioned, they're coming in through the Agency channel as well. And our retention continues to be great. So a long-winded way of saying, yes, they're affected. Yes, they'll take rates. Clearly there's a negative to that. It is important that they do that. They do it in a way that is meaningful for them and keeps them in business. My suspicion is we'll pick up something on the other side of the balance sheet there as other companies need to take rate and perhaps people reevaluate both their auto and homeowners package.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So fourth quarter growth picked up in both channels. It would be helpful, just in line with your commentary around Snapshot, if you could give us a sense of how much Snapshot might be contributing to the recent year growth. And just sort of more generally, you've talked about your advertising is starting to work, and I'm wondering if we primarily should be seeing this as something that would actually drive inbound quotes in sort of greater response rates in Direct and online.","Glenn M. Renwick","Josh, to the Agency channel, I would say very modest. I can't give you a quantification of it, but I would not say Snapshot was the driver of the independent Agency channel growth, which we saw nicely in the fourth quarter. I would suggest to you there that, that is probably more a result of other people's rate actions. And as agents are in the position to sort of see those almost on a daily basis when they hit, that they can change their placement or possibly even renewals. All right? [ph] That's a bigger driver that -- as you know, that is a comparative rating environment. So when there are rate changes, that sort of comes through very quickly, and agents can arbitrage to whichever carrier they think is appropriate as they're representing them. I'm sure they feel good about them, so if you have a rate that's beneficial, you're likely to get some business. I think we're benefiting more from that. With regard to Direct, I don't think there's any question that -- as I said earlier, when I try to put a few data points out there about Snapshot, our advertising for Snapshot in what we call sort of rivals in work on [ph] Flo, where Flo is actually sort of transposed into individual cars as a metaphor for the Snapshot device, that seems to have worked. Along with a little bit of reality built into our advertising, where we see someone plug the device in and say \"That was pretty easy.\" Surprisingly, that would seem easier in retrospect than they do when we're planning, but those clearly suggested to people that Snapshot is something that they should try. How much new business we get from Snapshot versus other advertising is very difficult. And while I could sort of ramble on, I'm not going to sort of say I can measure that specifically. I would say the likelihood of someone coming to Progressive and then showing interest in Snapshot -- just remember, they get a quote and then decide to take the device -- that seems to have been -- as I said, the unit shipment on that continues to go up. We haven't seen the plateau on that, so the level of consumer acceptance is very high. And as we showed in our fourth quarter results, our new prospects seem to be starting to gain some momentum. But I think that's more of a combination of both product, advertising and possibly even rate from other companies or perhaps people getting renewals with an increase.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it. I guess the one -- that's very helpful. The one follow-up I would make to -- I think this is -- in fairness, you probably already answered it. This is in part related to Josh's question. But it appears from what you said and what you guys have published publicly is that you're getting better than the average mix, and there's clearly sort of a better -- the calibration is positive on the selection side, then with retention in the long run, it should make sense. The question, though, is investors are short-term animals, and so we're all sort of trying to figure out -- isn't this, in the near term, I'd say the next 12 months, 24 months as you guys roll this out, should we be thinking about this as margin-neutral, dilutive or is it perhaps even accretive as we think about sort of the power of this model?","Glenn M. Renwick","I won't comment on your tone, but let me comment on sort of what I think is the [ph] -- should be responsible. It's accretive in number of customers. And I'm not being disrespectful in that answer. I think what I really need to focus on, Progressive needs to focus on, is more and more customers all the time and at the right premium. So when we offer these discounts, we would not clearly take a book of business and say \"Gee, let's just offer a big discount to it.\" That would be bullish. This has to be able to generate more customers, potentially -- and as I indicated earlier, the mix seems to be suggesting more than potential, a set of customers that we might not otherwise have gotten. I believe fully that this is so profound in terms of rating that is offering a level of segmentation that heretofore hasn't really been seen. Perhaps credit was the last thing that even came close to that. And as this gets traction, and we're not talking about just a few people, it will build on itself by reputation. And my suspicion is that the volume, as long as we're priced at our targets -- we have not changed our targets in any way shape or form. We'll accommodate Snapshot or we'll just say \"Hey, we'll subsidize for a while,\" or any of those sort of things. So I wouldn't be looking for change in margin based simply on Snapshot. As I said earlier, you might be looking and use some caution in interpreting average low -- average written premium. So we may have a new business coming on at an average written premium lower than we previously did. That doesn't worry me nearly as much as it would be if we weren't matching loss costs with the premium.","Brian C. Domeck","Josh, this is Brian. What I would add on is certainly there's the new customer traction. There's also the long-term benefit of keeping them longer, which we clearly have seen even in our initial data that those who receive a discount and participate get -- stay with us longer. So there is the long-term premium gains. And the pricing segmentation is very important, and we are always trying to price towards actual loss costs. And I think as we get closer and closer to those in terms of having those be reflective of what we believe loss costs will be, and if we can out-segment our competition and have greater pricing accuracy, I think in the long term, we win on that front. The -- and it's just continuing our emphasis on price segmentation, pricing skills, having a low cost strategy. And if we do both, we think our prices in the marketplace will be very competitive going forward.","Glenn M. Renwick","One other element, of course, that goes into the combined ratio is the expense ratio. So we fully appreciate and understand average written premium. I'd love to have that be higher because that gives me greater leverage on expenses. But as Brian indicated, retention is a much more powerful animal there, both to expense ratio and frankly, to long-term margin. So I will tell you -- you might be best thinking of margin as neutral because we're not compromising at all. The upside to margin may very well relate more to the retention story.","Operator","Our next question is from Vinay Misquit with Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question, just to follow up on Snapshot, just wanted to clarify the economics of the business. So for the existing customers who already have a Progressive insurance policy, wouldn't that be margin-dilutive for the good customers? And can you really raise rates for those drivers who you identify as being bad drivers? And then for the new customers also, wouldn't the Snapshot mean lower margins for the best drivers? And can you really raise rates or charge higher pricing for the bad drivers?","Glenn M. Renwick","I've answered this many times. Do you want to take a shot at that? All right. You ask a very, very, very important question, and one that I am going to answer as best I can for you. And it may be that this is one that requires a little bit more graphical support, so our next meeting might be even a better opportunity to do it. First of all, our existing customers are written under a contract that goes on, so we're not going to all our existing customers and changing their rate. That -- we simply don't have the data to do that. We don't have the driving scores. So when you implement anything, as much as we might like it to be different, when you implement something, you have to draw a line in the sand and say people going forward will be in this contract and get advantage at this price. We have no idea of the driving score of our installed base of customers, and they're not showing any great propensity to reevaluate or come back or whatever. They are free to do that. We do have some endorsement behavior, where someone says -- they see it on television and say, \"I like that.\" And of course, we will never withhold that from any customer. But that really is not a big issue. But if you extrapolated that and took a discount across the entire book, then we know what the outcome of that would be. With regard to new customers, we'll keep it relatively simple. And I said in my letter that I was no longer going to give the specific numbers, but let's say x customers come to us and try Snapshot and we offer no discount. X is considerably smaller than y here. Y would be customers that come to us, try Snapshot and get some level of discount. Those customers, we're obviously very happy with. The x customers, if 0 was the right answer, then we're indifferent. We would have sold them the policy at that anyway. But there is a good chance it wasn't 0, it would've been in our estimation plus-z. We understand plus-z. We understand that we have to price this in total to balance out both with the current book and the level of discount we give new customers. So we want to be able to give as much as possible, but we recognize we have a factor that we're not pricing for [ph], and over time, that will balance out. I would tell you that -- a way I've described it, and I don't know that it's worked particular well, but I've described it as D [ph] is important, but it is raining in the ocean, and we can make that up on a relatively small adjustment to the pricing we give across the book or in the discount structure. Hopefully that helps. If not, we will try in a more elaborate way in June.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That's certainly very helpful. My second question was on the new apps decline, and that declined by 2% last year. Just curious about whether that was more related to Progressive being more disciplined than peers. And are you seeing peers now raising rates as we saw, except in the fourth quarter of last year? And also curious just to what you're seeing with your largest direct competitor in terms of raising rates.","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes -- and Vinay, I'd certainly like to say discipline, but that's for you to decide. I have a little grid that is put together here -- I see Matt puts it together -- that is sort of growth and profitability. And obviously, you're all familiar with those kinds of grid and being in the top right, or in this case, is the place where you're growing and have great profitability. I once animated that grid because obviously everything depends on time frames, and it's amazing how few stay in that sector and how many go in and out of that sector. So the one thing I'd say to you is that growth and profitability clearly are an ordered pair. It's not always clear the time frame in which they're ordered. So we believe that we had rates that were appropriately set for most of the year. We did see some favorable development that probably was more than we expected. Nonetheless, we had the discipline to stay with those rates. In the early part of the year, we think shopping behavior was down, and we may not have had quite the conversion rate that we could have had, but that discipline seemed to pay off as we went closer into the fourth quarter and trends, which we think we had priced for, were being realized by others. Across the board, it seems that there is more propensity for rate increases than decreases. And as I mentioned before, it's possibly one of the reasons we're seeing an increase in volume in the fourth quarter. Did I get most of your question?","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes. One last thing, if I may. Your marketing spend and technology spend was up, especially within the Direct segment. Do you expect that to be on a rising trend, or you expect the expense ratio within the Direct segment to tick down this year versus last year?","Glenn M. Renwick","You want to take that, Brian?","Brian C. Domeck","I can speak towards the advertising spend. We do plan to continue to increase advertising spend, but that is always subject to our own assessment of the yield on that spend, and we've talked about that a fair number of times. But currently, we're pleased with the yield in terms of acquisition costs and cost per sale, as well as some of the other what we might call brand health measures of consideration and preference, et cetera. So right now, we feel good about our ad spend and we do plan to continue to have that increase. It may not increase certainly at the pace that it had 2 or 3 or 4 years ago, but we still plan to increase it. But we will always reevaluate that. And on the technology front, that's one area within our company that we actually have a pretty disciplined approach in terms of budgeting and allocation of resources, both labor and capital. And while that is expected to increase a little bit in 2012, we're keeping pretty good tabs on that, and it's likely to increase at a lower rate than our premium growth is.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, so this is a follow-up. Do you expect there to be a small amount of -- expenses should decline this year versus last year because of that reason?","Brian C. Domeck","Well, that technology cost would be across all business groups, so it could also show up in commercial or Agency, so it wouldn't only be in Direct. The other thing that I'd point out, at least in the first 6 months of this year, remember, and we've noted this, that due to the change in accounting for deferred acquisition costs, we will have in the first 6 months approximately $25 million of costs that are no longer deferred. Most of that shows up in the Direct channel expense ratio. Not all, but the vast majority of it shows up in the Direct channel expense ratio. So early in the year, you might see a level that might not be the same as towards the end of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple questions. On Snapshot. So if I'm insured by another company, can I just call Progressive up and say, \"I want Snapshot,\" and have it sent to me and become a Progressive policyholder under Snapshot right away?","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes, Michael. Let me describe the way it works. What you do is you could call us up, go online, go to an agent, same as any other way that you would approach us. You would get a quote based on all of the measures that we would use and previously have used and develop a rate. Let's just say for now, $500, sake of argument. You would then get asked \"Would you like to try to improve your rate through the use of Snapshot?\" You would say yes in this case, and we would give you a device i.e. we would give it to you in the mail, and you would follow up within a few days, and you would install it in your vehicle. We would know the moment you install it. And in return, you get to be able to see exactly what data is relevant to you on a website. And after 30 days of usage, we would say, \"Michael, based on your driving behavior that we've observed and the things that are important to us, we think that you could be due a 17% discount. And here's the deal we're going to make with you. We'll actually give you that 17% discount for the remaining term of your policy.\" We write 6-month policies, and at this stage, you've had a 30-day measurement period and probably a few days of some mail and stuff, so that maybe we're 35 or 40 days into the policy. So we would then give you that discount for the remaining part of your policy. We would continue to observe your driving behavior through the chip that you've installed, and we would require that you keep it installed. And at the end of that policy period, or actually, the required number of days that we offer you a renewal price at the expiration of your policy, we would then tell you, \"Hey, that 17%,\" -- is that what I said? Okay. \"That 17% looks good,\" or we go, \"It wasn't as good as we thought. It's really 15%,\" or maybe, \"It's a little better than we thought. 21%.\" Now I'm not being convenient in suggesting that. The fact is it doesn't change very much, so we want people to know that it's not like we're going to give you 17% and then say, \"6 months, so it's really 3%.\" We would do that if that's what it said, but that does not seem to be the behavior that we observe, so you would then get a renewal quote that would reflect the longer period of observation that we've made. At that point, we would say, \"That unit, by the way, has some value to us. You're obligated to return it to us,\" and that would become inventory for us to recycle to the next person at Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I see. Okay. Fair enough. I guess on Snapshot a little bit more. So the first stage of Snapshot, kind of to think about -- I mean, following to, I think, both Joshes' questions earlier is sort of taking premium per PIF down as you convert full fare customers, your own customers, and then the next stage is once you normalize for these lower sort of aggregate margins on this cohort that you're now charging a discount to but where retention is better, I mean, is that kind of how to think about the stages of profitability coming -- or the impact of profitability from Snapshot?","Glenn M. Renwick","I think that is fair. Let me go one step further, that ultimately, if we have greater insight into the true cost that individual should be paying and are willing to allow those that should be paying less to pay less, yes, we would have our retention. But those who should be paying more and are not, eventually, that will have to get recognized in the industry. Let's just assume losses are neither created nor destroyed. We're just trying to price to the individuals proportionate to their contribution to those losses. So if -- I'll say it again, if pure premium customers leave other companies and come to us, it is then likely they have been left with higher pure premium customers, and those rates will need -- their rates will need to reflect that at some point in time. So think about this as sort of a -- interjecting a very new variable, which is hugely disruptive, doesn't change the losses, but it reallocates the premiums.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just one last one on -- a question before was Direct. I think you said in the K, ad spending was up, quotes, new apps and life expectancy in Direct were down in '11. But then you mentioned also that in 4Q on a year-over-year basis, some of those trends saw an inflection, so an improvement. We don't really -- we can't really see that in the K or the discussion. Can you kind of talk about that stub period, 4Q, and kind of how these metrics changed versus the trend they showed on an annual basis?","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes, you are correct. You're not going to see PLE measures changed quickly. They are quite glacial changes, and that's by nature the way we measure them, and so on and so forth. I think I would just reiterate there, it really is the -- more stabilization of rate in Florida versus a shock. One of the things that I'd like --- I'd love to be able to avoid at all cost is shocking our customers, our base of customers with a rate change that is, let's say, greater than 5%. That's a shock generally to consumers, and we did that. Would had to do that. Others are doing it, and perhaps they're doing it a little bit even as we speak. I don't expect but can't eliminate the possibility that we have other changes that we need to make. And as we start to measure our PLE for customers that are now renewing or renewing into the new rate revisions that they've come in through, we should expect to see that policy life expectancy grow. And obviously, in the state of Florida, our average premiums will grow because we've taken rate. We also see overall a little bit of an increase in severities across the board. I don't think that's new. Most companies are probably seeing much the same thing. Relatively tolerable in bodily injury and a little faster than we've seen for some time in the physical damage and collision coverages. Frequency still tends to be a little bit on the downside. Personally, I get nervous about frequency. That can change quickly. Severity tends to be pretty reasonable and real when you see it. Gas prices might change a few things in the next month or 2. Who knows.","Brian C. Domeck","The only other thing I'd add to that, at least as it relates to the Direct channel, we are seeing more recently an increase in our conversion rate and -- which is fueling some of the new business growth. So whether that is reflective of our rates relative to other rates in the marketplace, I suspect so. I don't know all the rate changes that other folks have taken, but as you've seen in the industry, combined ratios have gone up for many carriers. So I suspect it's a combination of our rates relative to others in the marketplace has improved our conversion rate a fair amount, particularly in Direct. And some of the growth in both channels, whereas some of it is a reflection of either rate changes we've taken or competitors' rate changes. Because it's not necessarily every individual state is at these elevated levels. There are some states and subset states that are growing quite nicely.","Operator","Our next question is from Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Glenn, earlier you, I, think qualified -- clarified, I should say, the agency count increase from 30,000 to 35,000 as just a revised reporting number but not really a stat increase in the number of agents. I'm wondering whether Allstate's relationship termination was a little bit more than 1,000 agents in the fourth quarter. Is that a stepped [ph] change? Will that matter at all to independent agency companies?","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes, it does, and I recognize my answer there might seem strange, but we just -- we've used 30,000 for an awful long time, and a few of us were asking is that -- should we really go back and see exactly what the number we should use? So that number -- that answer was exactly that. You're asking now is the change or are other changes that are being reported from Allstate having any effect on the IA channels. I would tell you, to my knowledge, which I think is pretty decent, not in large enough numbers to really talk about here. But have we had agents come and ask us for appointments as independent agents to continue their professional careers? Yes.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's exactly what I was looking for. Second question, I guess you mentioned again in the letter or in the annual report that Australia is not yet a significant component to revenues. Is that going to change anytime soon?","Glenn M. Renwick","As a significant part of revenues?","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Glenn M. Renwick","No. No, it really isn't. And I don't mean to be avoiding anything there, but frankly, the revenues -- this is pointing out a lot of things for us, which is all fine. But I would really encourage you as analysts to one, take me at my word and I'll tell you anything that really is appropriate to tell with Australia, with volume or anything like that. But this is truly, at this point, a rounding era for most of what we're talking about. Having said that, that doesn't mean it's not something that we take seriously and important. Clearly, the indications that I've thought [ph] in profit, not necessarily just to promote our own position, but just how difficult it is to establish brand, get a flow of customers, match your advertising with your average premium, be able to be comfortable that your policy life expectancy is a measurable and reliable number. Those are critically important to a direct business, and I can't stress how important they are. And surprisingly, we're finding things in Australia that we found in 1992 when we started Direct in United States, and they take a long time to be able to go from a standing start to something meaningful. But the premium in Australia is really less than $10 million, so -- and likely not to exceed that in great proportion this year. So we won't really be spending a lot of time talking about something that is not much more than a valuable R&D investment for us at this point in time.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","No, understood. Is that consistent with your expectations, say, 3 years ago?","Glenn M. Renwick","Probably a little slower, but I haven't found anything that is shocking me. Probably calibration, we were a little more optimistic on certain measures than is turning out to be the case. But surely, nothing that is sort of like \"Wow! How do we miss that?\" kind of thing, not at all. And this is one where we have to have some patience.","Operator","Our next question is from Alison Jacobowitz with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Alison Jacobowitz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess 2 sort of follow-up questions, because a lot has been discussed. The one is, if I'm remembering correctly, I think in the shareholder letter you mentioned being virtually profitable in nearly all states. I know you've been talking about Florida a little bit here and there, but I was wondering if you can give us an update on that. And then to the extent you're comfortable, the trends that seem to have reached an inflection in the 4Q that you talk about, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing early in 2012, and maybe particularly, how it relates to the app growth in Direct being slower than you would have liked last year?","Glenn M. Renwick","Sure. Do you want to take profitability by states? Just as Brian sort of thinks through this issue there, we think of 2 different measures: one is 96, our target; and two, profitability being 100 combined.","Brian C. Domeck","Yes, in terms of profitability, certainly in 2010, we acknowledged that we had some profit concerns in some of our large states. And we took corrective actions, and many of those, which we mentioned in the past, were states that have the personal injury protection coverage, where we saw loss trends accelerating. We took pretty significant corrective actions in all of those states where we effectively raised rates a fair amount and that contributed to lower new application production in early parts of 2011. We then became much more comfortable with our rate level in these large states, including Florida and New York and New Jersey. The one state where we still have some fairly significant concerns in terms of profitability, the state I would mention would be Michigan, where we still have not been able to achieve an underwriting profit. We're still -- we've taken significant corrective actions, but we still may have a ways to go there. But certainly in the interim we have taken lots of rate there and new business production has fallen off as a result. The other state that had been of mention previously was Massachusetts, and we're pleased to report that that is getting -- in 2011, it was very close to being profitable on a calendar year basis for the year, and we feel good about our rate level there and look to be able to see that state growing again. Having said all of that, I would say we always need to stay vigilant in some of these pretty high volatile states. Florida being one of them. New York being another. Michigan will always be on our watch and monitoring lists. The loss trends and the environments tend to be very volatile, and we've seen this not only over the last 3 years, but if you go back 10 years or 15 years, these tend to be very volatile markets, where combined ratios for us in the industry have come up and down. Corrective actions, and so we need to sort of remain vigilant there. As Glenn talked about earlier in the conversation, it's one thing to be growing. It's another thing to be profitable, but having the ordered pair of both profitable growth, it's -- you have work diligently on that. So we feel good about our aggregate rate level. In the last year, our rate change has been relatively modest across the marketplace. Rate change in our last 12 months is something like plus-1% on -- in aggregate. But I'm certain there will be individual states where we'll have to take more corrective actions, but that's part of our discipline and what we try to do each and every day.","Glenn M. Renwick","And Alison, trends for the quarter, I'm not sure exactly what you're looking for there but I'd just give you a couple of pieces of color. I mentioned earlier that physical damage, severity trends are now a little faster than we'd seen for some time, which is okay. We priced to those. They're not sort of so ridiculous that they'll necessarily cause consumers to have major problems, but we're starting to see a little pickup in new car sales and all of that could be good from our perspective. The bodily injury -- the physical damage, as you well know, is not a big driver of reserves, so I'm not too worried about that. We just need to make sure that we get it into pricing at the right level. Bodily injury, which clearly is a big driver of reserves and pricing, seems to be manageable. The one -- and Brian hit it with almost all the states that he mentioned, one that really is always going to be something on top of mind for all carriers and auto is PIP. PIP sometimes has severities that we can sit and we can talk about, and then the real question is \"Well why is this happening?\" And unfortunately, that answer gets a little trickier. In Florida, there is some very real issues in terms of why that's happening right now because of some changes in quote decisions that have promoted a large number of claims that were, we believed, reconcile or sold and paid to be reconsidered, and that is something that the whole industry is facing. That's not a trend that you typically can anticipate or put into your pricing, so I hope we don't see a lot of that.","This year, gas prices might affect a little bit the monitor or the mileage driven. One of the comments that we made in our investor meeting is for us, this is actually trying to be alert to those frequency changes, possibly driven by exogenous events such as gas prices. We now have a very large sample of automobiles running around the United States that we can actually determine if, in fact, there are instantaneous changes in miles driven based on certain events. Or at least try to relate those as quickly as possible. So we feel great that we're in a position to have that early monitoring device, such as the Snapshot devices that we have out there. We still see a fair amount of advertising in the industry. I don't expect that to fall off, but it, in my belief, becomes harder and harder for those without a great deal of brand recognition to break into the significant consideration set. So we're delighted that we're there. And we're going to price as -- I threw in a chart of industry-wide premium growth and combined ratio, and you well remember when the industry was running at low 90s and hitting 80s on a regular basis. Those days have long since changed. And now that -- while I recognize everybody has their own goal, I suspect most companies are a lot closer to their acceptable level of combined ratio, and some possibly over it. The game gets a lot harder now. The tight road is really there, and a few points one way or another is not absorbed by the slack in the combined ratio, and that's likely to be overall a driver of premium growth. And most of this conversation to date has been us talking a little bit about what I think will be a meaningful offset to that overall premium growth driver for our customers, in that their ability to at least -- or our new customers to offset that with driving behavior discounts.","Matt Downing","Great. We have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question today is from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","I have a number of questions, but I'll limit myself to 2 out of courtesy. First, on the reserves, while I was looking at your triangles, normally I would expect to see the majority of the reserves from the recent or 2 most recent acts in the years. It appeared this year the great majority of the releases were '07 and '08 and up till now, those acts in years have shown very little development. So I was just wondering -- those years seem a little unusual. If you can talk about what happened. Why releases for such old acts in years and why it took so long for them to develop positively?","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes, fair question. That was about 50% of the release, so Brian, do you want to take that?","Brian C. Domeck","The large part of that favorable development, and in fact, a large part of our overall development was settlements on larger losses. So think of it as higher-limits policies, and those actually have a tendency to take longer to settle. So it's really closures on some of those older claims at less than reserves amounts, which is why they're showing up in '08 and '09 sort of acts in years.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Okay, got it, great. Was that CAT-related or is that just high-severity auto policies?","Brian C. Domeck","High severity. Bodily injury claims for the most part.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Understood, okay, great. And then just my other one is from what GEICO reported in the Berkshire results, it looked like they're at 100 combined this quarter, and I think they're a little bit high in the Q3 as well. I'm just wondering if you've noticed any change in their behavior. I mean, were those results a surprise to you at all? Or maybe you kind of expect it based on what you've observed from the market over the last year. Just wondering if you have any thoughts on their behavior versus yours.","Glenn M. Renwick","I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I hadn't noticed. You know what? I've -- and I mean this in -- much more serious than that comment. I think we're always better off just talking about Progressive and what we do. We know how hard it is to sort of be profitable over long, long periods of time, because it's the pricing decisions you make in very different periods. And sometimes, not GEICO-related, people can celebrate sort of volume and good profitability, but they're not really the matched pair. I'll let GEICO speak for themselves. It's a terrific company, and you look at their results over any long period of time, and I tell you, if you think about that top right-hand corner of growth and profitability, when I said I animated it to see the movement of people in and out, we would probably be the constant along with GEICO. So I have nothing but admiration for them, and that doesn't mean we're not daily competitors, but they can speak for themselves on the results.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Very fair. I guess, have you seen any signs that their pricing behavior early this year is different than it would've been 6 months ago, and that maybe they are reacting to their results, I guess?","Glenn M. Renwick","I will give you this. We have seen that a higher percentage of our customers coming to us now previously being GEICO customers.","Operator","Thank you.

I feel like a broken record, but we continue to be really thrilled with our results. I started off my letter talking about having 15 consecutive quarters of net premium written over time. And so to me, at double-digits, I should say. And to us, that is really incredible. And I start thinking about not just growth in premium because, of course, that's very important, but it can be influenced by trends or a mix of business. I started thinking about what we also talk about that is growth in units. And so I looked back and realized that, we've had nine consecutive quarters of double-digit growth in auto policies for us. So to me, that's equally impressive. We continue to be bullish on where we've come from and where we're going, and that would be a lot of what we're going to talk about today. Andrew is going to focus on horizon 3. He's our new Chief Strategy Officer, and he'll talk about how we're thinking about the future. And then we'll have ample time for Q&A with John Sauerland and myself. So thank you for being in attendance.","You're all familiar with this construct. We call it the 3 Horizons based on McKinsey's 3 Horizons. Today, I'm not going to talk about horizon 3 because Andrew will cover that. He'll also cover a little bit of horizon 2. But as you recall in the last webcast, John Barbagallo and Karen Bailo gave a really deep dive to all the exciting things we're doing in horizon 2, including small business, our BOP coverage, TNC, fleet, Smart Haul, just to name a few. We have a plethora of things that we've invested in a couple of years ago, they're really coming to fruition now, and we're very excited about that. But it doesn't mean that we won't stop thinking about more opportunities in horizon 2, we absolutely will. And we'll make sure that we capitalize on our brand, our acumen in terms of analytics, our segmentation strategy. But probably more importantly, once we get those plans together, the ability for 40,000 Progressive people to execute on those plans.","Speaking of execute, that's what we call horizon 1. And we've really -- for the vast majority of progressive people over this last couple of years, really want everyone to focus on executing horizon 2. Think of auto and home, bundled, monoline, but taking growth, increasing our market share. It's been something that we're surgically focused on because it can get exciting to think about the horizon 2 and horizon 3 opportunities, and they are, but we have so much to gain here, and I believe our strategy has worked incredibly.","For the next few slides, I'm going to show our net premium written growth over 10-year period with the exception of our property. I'll show that from 2015 when we took over a controlling interest in ASI. We will look at that, and then we'll look at our combined ratio, the orange line, compared to the industry, the gray line. So as you can see, this is auto for the last 10 years. We've had incredible growth, especially over the last four or five years. In fact, in the last 10 years, we have grown premium $15.4 billion, and that's over 130% increase. ","And probably more importantly is that we've had a delta, on average, of 8 CR points lower than the industry. That to me is really incredible, especially as we've been growing at such a fast rate. On the commercial side, same story, huge growth, especially in the last several years. In fact, we've grown over 150% and $2.7 billion in premium. More impressively is the fact that the difference on average of the CR between us and the industry is a full 18 points. That is incredible, and that has led us to really understand the segmentation in this industry and continue to invest in horizon 2.","Our property, our home has grown substantially as well as we've kind of expanded across the country. We're about in lockstep with the industry. But that's not satisfactory to us because we want to have every product to make money. We don't subsidize per products. So we will take and have been taking the time to roll out our next product model, continue to increase rates, have some underwriting restrictions and have some coverage changes to make sure that we try to set expectations for next year to be within our target profit margin. But again, looking at these over time, we continue to be impressed with our ability to grow and grow profitably, especially compared to our peers.","The combined success of our insurance products and our investment income has really made a strong ROE, as you can see from these slides. So what you're looking at here is, the blue bar is Progressive, the orange bar is the S&P 500 P&C index and the gray bar is the S&P 500. And as you can see, over a 10- and 20-year period, we have substantially outperformed all the index and the S&P, and that's really impressive. So we continue to be thrilled with those results. In fact, over the last five years, we've returned 55% of net income to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. ","As a reminder, how you think about equity or capital, I should say, as you think about capital, we want to make sure we invest in expanding the business as long as the long term, it reaches our financial policies. Under-leveraged capital, we return to shareholders. And we want to expect -- we expect a return on equity in excess of its cost. The importance of net income, EPS and ROE is never lost on us. But we view achieving long-term performance of these measures is stemming from our consistent focus on the primary elements of our business model. And that's, very clearly, grow as fast as we can at a 96. We have done this since we went public in 1971, so nearly 50 years. You can see from the data on the chart that, that formula works, and we'll continue with that.","So now I'd like to introduce you to Andrew Quigg, our Chief Strategy Officer. You've probably seen him on this stage a few times over the years, a little background on Andrew. He has a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics from Yale and an MBA from Harvard. He came to Progressive in 2007 as a Product Manager in the Agency, a division. And he's done a couple of states as a Product Manager in both agency and direct channel. After that, he ran our direct media business. And more recently, he was a General Manager of our customer experience organization in the CRM, and really focusing on retention. He's done a great job there. Last year, we named him our first ever Chief Strategy Officer. And so he's here today to talk about Horizon 3. Andrew?","Andrew Quigg","Thank you, Tricia. Today, I have the pleasure of sharing some additional details around Progressive's growth strategy. For our agenda, I'll first walk through our four strategy pillars and provide more details on the growth strategy framework, which Tricia discussed earlier. In this area, I'll underscore the mission of the strategy group, which I lead. Second, we'll discuss the important balance we are striking between being aggressive with the opportunities available to the company and our long history of using capital prudently. Finally will be our high level framework for evaluating the Horizon 3 areas of opportunity. ","So let's get going with Progressive's business strategy. Executives, investors and analysts, all discuss company strategy, but it can take on a variety of meetings and approaches depending on the context. Definitions for the word strategy generally fall in two realms. Broadly, strategy can be any plan. Narrowly, strategy can be known as a plan for military action. But neither of these really correspond to strategy in the context we're discussing today. I feel the topic was well examined in a Harvard business review article from 1996 by Michael Porter, appropriately titled, what is strategy? In this article, Professor Porter asserts that differences in performance between companies is the result of the many, many activities that companies undertake. A company can outperform its rivals if it executes similar activities better. This is operational effectiveness. An example of this is segmentation. Every auto insurer segments their pool of risks. A company can also outperform if they choose different activities than rivals. ","This is strategic positioning, a historical example for Progressive has been Snapshot. Progressive uniquely invested in Telematics starting in 1998 and continues to differentiate ourselves in this space today. Professor Porter also argues that operational effectiveness is necessary, but not sufficient over the long run for outstanding performance. This is due to the rapid diffusion of best practices through talent movement, consultants and benchmarking. Instead Porter and many academics believe that choosing different activities is the basis for prolonged differentiation in performance. In particular, Porter detailed a method of looking at the activities of the firm and how they reinforce the strategy, the activity map. ","Strategic positions are strongest for firms where the activity map demonstrates a high degree of fit and internal consistency. On the screen is the activity map for Southwest Airlines in 1996 from the Porter paper. Each circle represents a strategic position of Southwest that was different than at least some of their competition. As a low cost carrier, activities like automatic ticketing machines and quick gate turnarounds were important to keeping costs in check. However, not all of the activities were low cost if viewed in isolation. Southwest pay their employees more than others, recognizing high quality employees would help keep asset utilization high.","With that background, let's turn to Progressive's business strategy. We have four general strategy pillars at Progressive. People and culture, competitive prices, broad needs and leading brand. Our core values, purpose and vision also sit at the middle of these strategy pillars as a unifying focal point. Progressive has provided webcast over the years to our investors outlining additional aspects of our organization. The webcast provide a good overview of the additional activities and the fit of Progressive's activities. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2017, marketing and acquisition leaders discussed our leading brand and the supporting marketing tactics and innovations. In the first quarter of 2018, and our business unit controllers discussed operational efficiency from many different lenses, including how technology and automation play a role in reducing our expense ratio. In the second quarter of 2018, CRM President, John Murphy; and CIO, Steve Broz, outlined investments in relationships with our customers as we continue to refine our customer-centric approach.","In the third quarter of 2018, Personal Lines President, Pat Callahan, demonstrated how the speed of innovation and product development creates a competitive moat. In the fourth quarter of 2018, our CHRO, Lori Niederst, outlined how our people and culture creates sustainable competitive advantage for the company. And finally, in the first quarter of 2019, our portfolio managers, Rich Madigan and Jonathan Bauer, discussed how our investment approach supports our strategy pillar of competitive prices. The choices we make in these interlocking activities represent our unique strategic position, which is not as simple as low cost or focused on one segment. In my role, I have the fortune of interacting with external advisers, consultants and partners. Each of them views Progressive differently and believes that some aspect of this activity map is the most important. I know I speak for the entire executive team when I say that it is truly the internal consistency of all these activities that makes Progressive special. It is extremely hard to duplicate the success of Progressive by replicating one bubble without the full tapestry.","Along the bottom of this page are parts of our strategy that have emerged over the past decade and a half. Broads needs, in particular, became more pronounced as we entered into the destination era. We want to solve the broad needs of our customers over their lifetimes. This requires us to investigate the needs of our customers and adjacent areas where we can serve them. Broad needs also provides Progressive with an avenue for diversification as we look to disrupt other products and as we monitor changes in the mobility environment.","Tricia articulated this investigation of new products and services in Progressive growth strategy utilizing 3 horizons. We think of horizon 1 as executing on our current core products within property and casualty insurance. On the right-hand side, you can see that the market share we currently have today, only 8% of Personal Lines and 2% of Commercial Lines. We are fortunate to have ample headroom to grow. Horizon 2 includes expanding to adjacencies within property and casualty insurance. And beyond horizon 2, horizon 3 represents an opportunity to explore close-end opportunities to leverage our core competencies. We think of this area as generally being outside of property and casualty insurance. As an example of horizon 2, we have Commercial Lines. In August, John Barbagallo and Karen Bailo discussed how commercial -- the Commercial Lines business is expanding their addressable market from $14 billion to more than $50 billion.","On the right-hand side are the efforts underway in Commercial Lines. Some of these reflect improvements in our core Commercial Auto product, but a large part of the expansion is from new products, general liability and BOP that are horizon 2 initiatives within Commercial Lines. For horizon 3, the executive team decided to invest in a small group, the Progressive strategy group, to focus on horizon 3 in order to keep the vast majority of Progressive employees and resources focused on horizons 1 and 2. The vision for the strategy group is building and enduring Progressive for future generations, always growing. Our mission is to create lasting value by leading and establishing businesses beyond the core and supporting expansion of our property and casualty business. ","With that introduction to Progressive's strategy overall and the strategy group's mission within this, I'd like to turn to the important balance we are attempting to achieve in horizon 3. We have enormous growth potential as a company as we increase scope. We saw this play out in our acquisition of ASI, now Progressive Home, where we generated revenue synergies and leveraged our data footprint. On the revenue synergy side, you have heard over the past few years, how we've created additional opportunities to sell the Progressive Home product. This included expanding their state footprint from 27 to 44 states, adding thousands of agent groups and establishing the Platinum program. And finally, investing in direct sales through our Progressive Advantage Agency, adding an online quote-and-buy process and adding analytical triggers for our customers. In total, the impact is impressive as you can see on the right-hand side of this page.","As we abstract away from this example, our base of customers help us generate revenue synergies from new efforts. As a reminder, we have existing relationships with about 15% of U.S. households and hundreds of thousands of small businesses. Our proven ability to extend relationships is the first component of our growth value as a company. Possibly even more important is our data footprint. As an example, on the screen, we have two auto policy attributes and their impact on homeowners loss cost. We continue to find that auto behaviors are predictive of homeowners losses. In general, we see product upgrades at Progressive Home, including auto, methods and variables, are much more powerful than using isolated product information. ","To build on this further, we have historically seen our data footprint is driving data. What we found with Progressive Home is that we have responsibility data. Our data seems to be predictive of a number of behaviors. And our data footprint is larger than just our current insurance. We believe we have data on about 30% of U.S. households. When we combine our quote data, active customers and recently expired policies. This is the second facet of our growth potential as a company.","If we go back to our activity map, we can see that to execute on the Progressive Home synergies, we were able to leverage the entire network of activities and by reinforcing new activities, an ability to market additional protection to our customers and to leverage responsibility data for broad needs.","While growth potential is exciting to consider, we are very cognizant of the fact that we have a historic reputation for being prudent stewards of capital. Progressive has an excellent reputation for efficiently generating returns for our shareholders and returning capital. Our comprehensive ROE since 2010 has been consistently high, especially in the past few years, and we have returned these earnings to shareholders at a high rate. More than 50% of comprehensive income is returned to our shareholders. This reputation has provided the company with a solid valuation and low cost of capital. Continuing to add to these high returns is a daunting task that is ever-present in my mind. It is our goal that these additional business lines will add to these impressive results while growing the company.","We also know that diversification is inherently risky. As an example, Bain has produced some insightful research on growth diversification. Let me describe this chart. Along the left-hand side are different dimensions by which a new business can be judged. The dimensions are the 5 Cs: customers, costs, channels, capabilities and competitors. As the new business shares less and less of these aspects, they are defined as being further steps away from the core. Bain finds that each step away reduces the probability of success by about 60%. This work, and others like it has caused us to isolate certain factors like customers, channels and capabilities, as we think about new products and services.","To summarize, we see both immense opportunities for Progressive, and we'll continue to balance these with a sober perspective of the challenges. With that background, I'd now like to spend some time explaining how we will identify and execute on horizon 3 ideas. We think about high potential ideas in three ways. First is market attractiveness. We want to invest in horizon 3 businesses, where the overall market makes it more likely that we'll have success growing. We look at a number of factors here. Trends, we track a number of trends and have a subset of macro trends, which we believe will impact our industry and adjacent industries. Market metrics, factors such as size, profitability and market concentration, can be observed and evaluated for industries. Market dynamics, like Porter's five forces provide greater insights into the power structure of value chains. Next, we look at Progressive's ability to win. For any possible area, there needs to be a fit with Progressive. Here, we examine the fit with our strategic pillars and our activity map. We look at assets that we could leverage like relationships and data. Finally, we consider the proximity to our core and the likelihood of success. In the intersection of these two areas, we also need to find an unmet consumer need.","These horizon 3 potential opportunities appear at the top of our horizon 3 process. Our strategy process team, led by Navin Verma, generates and researches these opportunities. Once we have an area of interest and a consumer need, we have two approaches to execute that are not mutually exclusive. We have formed a corporate development team under Erwin Raeth to investigate external organizations that fulfill our ideas. We also have an internal growth incubator, led by Azadeh Hardiman to build new businesses. We believe building has a longer timeline, but with lower risk. We're doing a pause for a moment on corporate development, given that Progressive has not traditionally been an acquisitive company. ","We still believe that this will be a rare event. Beyond acquisitions, the corporate development team has two additional methods to engage with companies, strategic alliances and strategic investments. Progressive has a long history of alliances through Progressive Advantage. On the screen, you can see 15 Progressive Advantage relationships that stretch across many products. We continue to believe that our Progressive Advantage organization is a well suited path to meet the needs of our customers and provide income without capital requirements. An example of a successful horizon 3 product is life insurance, specifically, term life insurance. On the left-hand side, you can see our view of the market attractiveness. ","It has medium to low attractiveness from a market perspective. However, Progressive's ability to win is higher, given that it is approximate to our core and could leverage our pillars and assets. We also find, in our research, that many families go unprotected due to a complex research and purchase process. In addition, based on our brand, customers have told us, they can see us offering the product more than other leading brands. Finally, we've been able to work with a carrier to distribute life insurance products and have increased sales by about 10 times over the past eight years. In addition to protecting consumers, Progressive has generated millions in commissions and materially increased retention for bundled customers on our core auto product. In addition to strategic alliances, we leverage strategic investments in the corporate development group. ","As you may have noticed in our quarterly and annual reporting, we do own a small amount of nonredeemable, preferred securities in private companies. Today, these preferred securities represent strategic investments from Progressive. On the screen, you can see two of our representative investments so far in Upstart, our personal loans partner, and KeepTruckin, our commercial EBI partner. Strategic investments allow Progressive to better understand industry dynamics where Progressive has interest and better strategically and economically align with key partners. My purpose today was to keep you apprised of our investments, approach and progress in horizon 3. I hope the past 20 minutes have been helpful in providing this context. As we reach material milestones in this exploration, we'll certainly provide additional updates. To recap our conversation, we believe that we have a robust strategic position that has been underscored by previous investor presentations. We have generated impressive revenue and data synergies with Progressive Home and believe this will continue as we consider additional products and businesses. We balance this with a recognition that growth beyond the core is challenging, and we will continue to be prudent with our capital. Finally, we have our framework to evaluate opportunities and make them actionable, both through external and internal approaches. ","I'll now turn it back over to Tricia and John Sauerland for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Julia Hornack","[Operator Instructions]","Before we get started with questions from the conference call line, Tricia, I have received quite a few questions about the change in dividend policy we announced in December of 2018. So why don't you start with a little bit of that history and the reasons for that change.","Tricia Griffith","Absolutely, so the Board terminated the dividend policy that we had for many years in December of last year. Let me give you a little bit of background. So in 2007, we initiated a very formulaic variable dividend policy. And what we -- the three items we looked at, one was a full year after-tax underwriting profit. We multiplied that by our internal gain share factor. And that is a factor we used -- then we looked in growth and profitability across the board. And it is for our employee bonus that it's on a range from 0 to 2.0. And then Board would decide a percentage on that. So it would be the after-tax underwriting profit times the factor, times at that point 20% divided by the number of shares. And that's how we came up with the very formulaic dividend policy. ","We made a tweak in 2008 and we said that if comprehensive income was less than the after-tax underwriting profit, there would not be a dividend. And that was, although, just kind of a nuance was very important because in 2009, after the financial crisis, we did not pay a dividend. So it was kind of a prudent change to the dividend policy. 2010, the only change we made was we raised the percentage from 20% to 25%. And then in 2011, we raised it to 33.3% and that stayed the same until the end. We have done a couple of extraordinary dividends. In addition, in 2010, '12 and '13, and we gave $1 per share or an extraordinary dividend in top of the variable dividend. So as we started really growing in earnest around 2016 and going to the debt market occasionally because we needed capital because how fast we were growing. ","We started thinking about, does this still work? And the logic around it was that our shareholders would kind of be in lockstep with our employees. And that does work on a calendar year basis, but when we think of shareholders, we really want to think of how are we creating this enduring business? And does it always make sense, to have -- when we have a lot of capital, to give it back or when we need capital to give it back. And it didn't -- it really wasn't aligned. So we took a look, and we said we really want something that was a little bit more flexible. And so we spoke with the Board about it. They terminated the dividend as we know it in December of 2018. And for us, this really allows us some flexibility. And its flexibility if we need capital, its flexibility, if there's some opportunistic event that we might want in horizon 2, horizon 3, and so this is the first year. ","As you know, on a quarterly basis, we -- shareholders earn a $0.10 per common share. And then in the fourth quarter, the Board will discuss any variable dividend and that will be payable in first quarter 2020. We did a Q&A in December, I think -- I believe, in December of 2018, and that was -- that's on our investor website under stock and the dividend policy. So we did a bunch of Q&As, if you want a little bit deeper dive into that. But that really is the history of our dividend policy. It's evolved as we have evolved, but I think it's been nice -- it will be nice, continue to have some flexibility given our current state of thinking about so many growth opportunities in the future. John, do you want to add anything to that?","John Sauerland","Sure. The trigger around comprehensive income being greater than after-tax underwriting income, certainly, it was instrumental in 2009. In 2018, however, it was potentially an issue for us in that investment income was very low. And you may recall, it was a material sell-off in December, underwriting income was robust. Around a 90 combined ratio, growing 20%, but comprehensive income was very close to becoming less than after-tax underwriting income. And so we are in a place where we were potentially not going to pay any variable dividend or potentially pay what we ultimately paid, which was about $1.5 billion. And we think that sort of binary trigger there isn't optimal, either for the company or management or shareholders. So I think that's another benefit of moving away from the previous approach to the variable dividend.","Obviously, the dividend is part of a capital management plan. We've been fairly transparent in our capital management philosophy. Obviously, we have capital requirements from a regulatory perspective, 3:1-ish for auto, about half of that for property. On top of that, we can carry a contingent capital layer, both of those, generally speaking, grow as we grow. So we have additional needs for capital. That said, at this point, we are in a very good position from a capital perspective, and we will continue to follow the path we have, as Tricia noted earlier, around returning under-leveraged capital to shareholders in the form of dividends or deploying them in share buybacks. So I guess, in aggregate, as Andrew noted, I think our financial stewardship has been good over the years. We have, as Tricia showed, achieved fairly impressive returns on our equity and it is certainly our aspiration and intent to continue to do so.","Julia Hornack","Great. So Chris, can you please introduce the first caller from the conference call line?","Operator","The first question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar at Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","I had a couple of questions. First, we did see a moderation in auto severity this quarter. And at the same time, a little less favorable frequency. Could you maybe talk about both of these shifts and what you see as underlying causes for those?","Tricia Griffith","So are you referring to collision, in particular?","Yaron Kinar","I'm referring to -- I think it was even more broad than that. I think it was overall severity and overall frequency.","Tricia Griffith","Yes, the frequency, overall, was a little bit less, more in the 2% range. And severity is a little bit up. We look at it differently in collision versus PD. So collision was -- the severity was less than in prior quarters. And there could be a lot of reasons, but we believe our mix of business is changing from a preferred perspective. But on the severity front, we know that it is costing more to fix cars and the components of the vehicles continue to be more expensive. And so we relate a lot of severity to that in total losses, but the frequency is still in the range. It's a little bit less -- I mean, the frequency, the frequency is a little bit less. And that, of course, is really hard to predict. That can go up and down, but we don't see anything systemic.","Yaron Kinar","I thought that property damage already actually came in, in the quarter.","Tricia Griffith","The property damage -- may you repeat that?","Yaron Kinar","That property damage severity came in this quarter.","Tricia Griffith","Yes.","John Sauerland","Yes. I would sort of characterize it. So a point or two, quarter versus year, we don't normally view that as a material trend. It's tough to project as it is. But if it's 6% severity change for the quarter, 7.4%, year-to-date. We consider that to be a similar severity trend. And from what we can see, our severity trends are fairly consistent with those of our competitors. We obviously don't have full transparency there, but we have pretty good insight, and we think severity is in the 6% to 7-ish percent range right now. Frequency, down 2% to 3%. And that's generally speaking, what we are thinking going forward as well.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question is around the agency new application conversion rates this quarter. Seem to be a significant decline there. Could you maybe talk about what drove that?","Tricia Griffith","Well, I think there's -- we've talked a little bit about a soft market, and there's less shopping when people's rates aren't changing. And so if you look over the last couple of quarters, there's been either rate decreases or less increases, so less shopping. And so as we've talked about in the past, we continue to advertise, and that affects both our agency and direct to make sure that we grow and the growth is slowing a little bit. We believe our conversion is still solid based on when people do shop, we have a competitive rate. But yes, we definitely have seen a slowing down because there's either been rate decreases or less increases. And I think we'll have to see if that changes are not based on what we're hearing from the industry, as you just talked about, from severity.","John Sauerland","Just to add that... Sorry.","Yaron Kinar","I just would have thought that the lower rates would have driven lower new applications but not necessarily decrease the conversion rate of these new applications.","Tricia Griffith","Well, yes. Well, good version is usually based on -- is the rate. When you do shop, is it the right way for you and some people, if it's not significant, it won't convert.","John Sauerland","On a year-over-year basis, actually in both the agency and the direct channel, conversion has been up. And it's been sort of a highlight of our product model introductions. And I would also add that its conversions has been improving in segments that we're targeting. So we're targeting more and more preferred customers, especially in the agency channel. We've seen nice shifts up and preferred characteristics of the business we're writing, and that's predominantly driven by the new product models and the conversion that is driven by those models and that we're getting more competitive by introducing factors for the preferred end of the segment that are more competitive.","Tricia Griffith","Yes, I think the only one we haven't -- where we haven't grown new apps on the agency channel with an inconsistently insured, which we call Sams.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Gary Ransom at Dowling & Partners.","Gary Ransom","Tricia, you mentioned in your letter on Snapshot, you said that your program encourages customers to improve their driving behavior. That's a little bit different from what I've heard over the last several quarters of measuring for pricing, using Snapshot to measure pricing as opposed to changing behavior. Is there something behind that message that you're doing differently, either in your newer distracted driving measurements or in something else?","Tricia Griffith","No. Not necessarily. I mean, we use that, obviously, as our most predictive variable, but we also do want to encourage people to understand when, from a distracted driving perspective, as an example, when they are using their telephone, hands free, not hands free, et cetera, mostly for the safety of every other drivers. So we've always cared about it, and we've tested different things, whether it's beeps, start giving you the information right away. It's still -- it's mainly used as a variable. But obviously, we want to give the best drivers, the biggest discounts. And so both of those things important, it's understanding our rate to risk as well as of helping people to drive better.","Gary Ransom","Do you have any intention of changing your -- the Snapshot concept of you just measure for 6 months, and you're done and make it continuous?","Tricia Griffith","You know what, we're actually -- we talk about that a lot, and that might make more sense on the mobile device versus the dongle we have right now. So we're always talking about that. And I'm always talking about different ways with which to use that data, whether it be for claims, et cetera. So we're always kind of in discussion around that.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research.","Amit Kumar","I wanted to go back to Yaron's question on loss cost trends and maybe build on that. If you look at the frequency and severity data by quarter, it has been stable. But in the queue, you talk about additional pricing actions. So all those being equal wire, why not would that translate into additional margin pressure from here as we head into 2020?","Tricia Griffith","Well, I think that depends on each one of our products. Obviously, I talked about property, and we're seeing some high loss cost on property. So of course, that affects trends. So our focus right now is to get into that profitability and expand our products and our segmentation skills and make some underwriting changes. But I think what we will look at is the continued severity trends, understand those where we feel like we're in a really good position as we haven't, in certain areas, where we've thought that small decreases would increase conversion. We've done that. But we haven't done it to the extent that some of our competitors have. ","So as things change, we believe we'll have to -- our rates would have to change substantially. And we've always talked about that with our customers because we know our customers want to have stable rates. And so when we think about increasing rates substantially or decreasing rates substantially, for that matter, we try to make them stable. So that it will be less sort of a topsy-turvy. But we'll follow the trends. And we will, as we've said in the past, take small bites of the apple. We've always said if we increase rates, we want to be out ahead of it and understand 1 -- 3:1 is better than 1:3, we used to say, to take small, small bites, so customers stay with us because another big part of, obviously, our growth strategy is retention.","Amit Kumar","Got it. The only other question I have is on commercial auto. In the queue, you talk about the change in loss cost trend. You talked about the shift in the mix of business towards for higher tracking as one piece. Intuitively, as the book pivots and other pieces versus a monoline book grows, would that translate into a higher initial loss pick as we get into 2020?","Tricia Griffith","I wouldn't take 1 quarter or 1 month of commercial to be -- to something -- we feel like it's not a very alarming trend. In fact, if you look at our year-to-date, we're in the high 80s. So we feel very comfortable with that. And in fact, if you look at accident year, it's even better, about 2 points better. So what we do, again, we surgically look at every BMT, every state, new and renewal, and we watch that closely. We take rate when we need it. As evidenced by -- if you remember, back in 2016, Commercial popped up a bit, and we reacted quickly and got back in the track. So we watch new business. We watch our renewal business. We watch our competition. You saw the delta we had in the combined ratio on Commercial Auto in comparison to the industry. So we are on that very aggressively all the time as we see something change because a lot of this could be affected by macroeconomic trends, we are on that. So if we see loss cost on a certain BMT go up, and we believe that trend is going to continue, we will be on that with rates or changes or underwriting restrictions.","John Sauerland","I would just clarify that our loss ratios are always bottom-up. They're not top-down. So you mentioned a loss ratio pick going into the next year. That's not how we reserve. So we actually have average reserves for losses that adjustors set below a threshold. And above that, we use the adjustor's estimate for the loss. We also have inflation factors that apply to other losses in the average layer over time so that if we think generally, severity trend is X, we are baking that in over the course of the year. So we then -- when we actually incur claims and add that to our IBNR, that's how we derive our loss ratio. We are seeing more large losses. And as I'm sure you noted, and Tricia alluded to, we did take a reserve change on commercial lines. In September to reflect those trends. But again, we don't go into the year with a loss pick and then develop that, we take a bottom-up approach.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Mike Zaremski","This is actually Charlie on for Mike. First question, one of your competitors recently announced initiatives that cut its expense ratio. Do you feel your expense ratio or loss adjustment expense ratio can fall in the coming years based on any specific initiatives that you are undertaking?","Tricia Griffith","We always look to have competitive prices. When you think about -- what Andrew went over, sort of our cornerstones and our pillars, it's really important for us to have competitive prices. So we constantly look for ways to be efficient. And there's a few things that we've talked about in the past. When you think of LAE, we talk about just gain efficiencies through more estimates that -- we can do through photos, making it efficient and customers are happy with that. That works as long as there's no supplements, et cetera, but we've continued to work our way into having a higher percentage of losses settled in this way. ","We continue to use our technology to get out in front of that. In terms of expense ratio, we talk about that all the time and my team, we're headed into our objectives for 2020. And we're talking about how we think about both expense ratio and LAE and have a goal to reduce that over the years. I talked about that a few years ago where we wanted to get down to a certain percentage. We continually do that. Of course, you don't want to do it, as an example, with claims, there's that balance of having the right amount of people, the right amount of talent because you could reduce your LAE substantially. But if it increases your indemnity, then it's not worth it. So we look at that all the time. It's really about people. It's about making sure that people have the right technology, and we've obviously used some things on the CRM side with AI to make sure that when our customers call in for really simple needs. ","We don't necessarily have to have a person on the end of the line. That, of course, makes sense, and it's easier for the customer. And helps with expenses. But yes, that's a big part of it. We know price is big. We know that we have to be competitive, and we will continually try to make sure we do the right thing, but we reduced our expenses across the board. Our non-acquisition expense ratio, I should say, on the other side, because we -- in terms of advertising, we'll spend as much as we think we should to make sure that we have efficient use of our media. And if our level costs are too high, then we won't. But we've been really happy about increasing our media spend. So we look at that a little bit differently. We look at non-acquisition expense ratio.","Mike Zaremski","Got it. And then can you update us on the take-up rate for Snapshot? And what percentage of users stay on the program after the initial period? And whether there's been any changes in that rate recently?","Tricia Griffith","Yes. I think the -- well, the take rate on the direct side is much higher. And probably, I think, around 40%?","John Sauerland","40%.","Tricia Griffith","40%, it's single-digits on the agency side, we continue to work with our agency workforce to, kind of, to understand that. We would say, at any given time right now, our policies enforced, someone's been on the Snapshot program at some time, about 15% of our policy enforced would say that. So we're really trying to make sure people understand the discount, understand what we're looking for. A lot of people, it's just -- it's that they don't want to do it because of big brother. I think it's sometimes hard to explain from the agency side, partly because we give a participation discount. ","But when we have the data, we make sure that you can get either a 20% decrease, which is great, or you could get a 20% surcharge. And so I think some people that try it may know that they're not going to get the discount and that won't work out for them. But we think it's -- we think it's, obviously, a great rating variable. We think it's a great for society because hopefully, you do change your habits. But the take rate has been pretty stable, but much higher on the direct side.","John Sauerland","I would take the opportunity to add that In the commercial space, we now have an analogous offering we call Smart Haul, and our commercial business is still largely -- by far and away, largely agency based. And the take rate for the commercial business for Smart Haul has been far more promising than it has in the Snapchat side for the Personal Auto. There we are working with our agents to target the four higher transportation segment. So I think interstate trucking, those premiums are fairly substantial. So if you can offer a customer a material discount, and they're an independent operator many times. It's a material consideration for them because that's a business cost. And we're seeing great -- as in the last quarter, I had John Barbagallo share our commercialized precedent, along with Karen Bailo, shared some of the results from that program, which are very promising. Loss ratio is very predictive from the information that comes from the electronic logging devices. And we're providing, as I mentioned, significant discounts as well as, surcharges. But even -- given that, our loss ratio line, if you will, is still fairly steep. So we think there's tremendous continuing potential with our Smart Haul program in Commercial lines.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Greg Peters at Raymond James.","Greg Peters","In your comments, you mentioned the capital requirements for your property business being about half that for auto. And I'm curious if that changes your expectations about underlying combined ratios or combined ratio targets. And in your letter, you also introduced the ASL agreement. And I was wondering if you could provide color on that.","Tricia Griffith","Yes. No, I think that capital requirements are really from a regulatory perspective to make sure that we have the right amount in case of losses. And then I think John referenced briefly, when we talked about the dividend policy, we also have a self-imposed contingency layer in case things happen, should it be a big catastrophe or whatever. So our capital requirements won't change based on that. Our reinsurance does in terms of us understanding the ultimate loss costs. So we went into the ASL a couple of years ago. And basically, we wanted it help us. It doesn't prevent going over 100 clearly, but we wanted to kind of lessen the downside depending on if we have not just name storms because now that's part of the ASL, but it used to be 63 LAE and non-storm or liability. It's really just another protection factor besides our name storms, our 1 in 100 years name storms. So that's something that we've had for a couple of years now. Just more of a downside protection.","John Sauerland","And just to elaborate on the combined ratio part of your question there. We target, generally speaking, return on capital across our product lines in the same neighborhood. So you're correct in that if we have to have more capital around for property, we target combined ratios for property that are lower than auto. You might quickly point out that, that is not right now, our performance, and we're very cognizant of that. As Tricia mentioned in opening comments, taking actions to improve profitability in the property space.","Greg Peters","My follow-up question. And I'm using the words from your conference call about an environment where there's less shopping. I'm curious if you can tell us how you might adjust your advertising budget, considering that we might be in this new environment where there is less shopping, as you described it, from your consumers?","Tricia Griffith","Yes. So how we look at our media spend is really, we believe, if -- we have an allowable cost per policy. And if our cost per sale is less than that, we'll continue to advertise if we believe it's efficient. We watch, what we call, NP6, which is new prospects that haven't shopped us in the last 6 months, and then we watch conversion. As long as those numbers, we believe, are within the guidelines that we set, then we'll continue to advertise. We want to make sure that we advertise across the board of all of sort of our customer set. So we offer -- advertise a savings message, protection message for auto and home, and we watch those to make sure how good each commercial is, how good each digital advertising are. We have -- we do such deep analytics from our media spend that we will continue to spend as long as we think it's efficient and if not, we'll pull back.","John Sauerland","Yes, we think that some of the lower levels of shopping over the previous periods has been driven by the fact that many competitors have been actually lowering rates. We think that environment has changed, and we're starting to see far less rate decreases and more rate increases. And naturally, as customers receive rate increases, they're far more likely to shop than the rate decreases. So it's a dynamic environment. As Tricia mentioned, we manage spend very dynamically, even daily. And when we're seeing changes in the environment, we can react very quickly.","Tricia Griffith","We don't want to -- you don't want to pull back either. Obviously, we still feel really good about our spend. But you don't want to pull back because as the environment changes, you want to consistently be out there because people will have awareness of you and then ultimately, if they shop you, that would be a consideration. So we even see a couple of the trends or the turning point where some -- there is some increases. So we can't predict what's going to happen. But John and I often talk about and look at data and challenge ourself \"is the soft market softening,\" because we have seen a turning point from that based on what we believe are consistent industry severity trends.","Unidentified Company Representative","I'm actually going to take a question from the webcast now because it kind of builds on a question that Greg just had. The question is, what specific actions is the company taking to achieve underwriting profitability in the Property segment? Should investor -- why should investors, excuse me, be confident that Progressive will get this line to underwriting profitability, when that has been a challenge during the last several years?","Tricia Griffith","We -- let me start with the end one. If you know the history of Progressive, when we set up to do something we execute it. And so I referred to in 2016, when our trends went up and we were a little bit over 96. We got together. We made changes in our expense ratio, and we got rate, et cetera. And we nailed that in really a short period of time. And Dave Pratt, you're on the phone, you can add in. So what we've looked at over the last couple of years, obviously, if you take out cats, we're profitable. ","The catastrophes, especially wind and hail have been substantial. And so we are basically -- we're changing some of our underwriting guidelines. We're changing some of our coverages, some of our deductibles in specific states, where we see that hail and wind. We're rolling out our 4.0 product. We have it in, I think, three states now, maybe three more by the end of the year, and then we'll have an aggressive rollout in 2020. If we have to pull back a little bit on growth, we will. We obviously have reinsurance as well. And now I think the beauty of having the ASI Progressive is that we have the auto R&D in pricers, the home R&D in pricers, and we can share that data to really understand loss experience across different consumer segments. So for us, we have all hands on deck.","I will leave from here today to go down to St. Pete to Progressive Home. We are encouraged about what we're seeing. It takes a little time because some of these are annual policies. But I feel very confident we will get where we need to go. And as a reminder, when we think about growth and profit, we always want to do both. And this has been an amazing several years where we've been able to grow substantially and make a lot of money. If we have to make a choice and we never want to, profit comes first. So we do what we can to make sure we make our target profit margins.","Dave Pratt","Tricia, I could add just a little detail on the wind and hail comment, if that's appropriate.","Tricia Griffith","Yes, please.","Dave Pratt","Because you're right, if you look at our losses, the weather losses in the last few years have been higher than we had priced for. The non-weather claims in water, fire, theft, liability, et cetera, we've been right on our pricing targets. And so we've -- when we price for weather because it's so volatile, we can't really use our own experience from the last few years as a good predictor of next year's losses. So we rely pretty heavily on models to do that. The models for hurricane performed pretty well. But what we've found as we've dug into this problem was that most of the tools we had been using for severe convective storms, so thunderstorms that cause wind and hail. We're not performing well at all. And so we've done a lot of work. We've adopted a new tool from Karen Clark and company that we think, with some proprietary adjustments on our part is a much better predictor of future losses. And we're using that to guide our pricing in states with significant wind and hail exposure. So I feel much more confident going forward that we're going to have -- we'll be priced to the risk accurately. And then we'll manage our risk concentrations in areas that get a lot of hail, just to make sure that we don't have an overconcentration in a place where we don't want to.","Tricia Griffith","Yes. And Dave is down in St. Pete right now, and I'll tell you, he's got an extensive career at Progressive doing many of these things. And if there's anybody that can right this ship, it will be him. And really, we have all hands on deck. So my confidence level is very high.","Greg Peters","Great. I actually have a follow-up question, sort of related, but it kind of speaks to the questions and the comments, I guess, that Dave had about weather and weather data. But the question is, what do you think the impact to the company will be in the long-term from the risks of climate change?","Tricia Griffith","I mean, that's really hard to say. And clearly, we will continue use of reinsurance to, again, protect that downside. I think what Dave said is right on target with that question as well in terms of us understanding the models better and understanding how they affect our book of business. And so he said, we have some very specific work we've been doing on severe convexity in the last several months, we feel good about it. We'll continue to tweak those things, continue to -- if we have to pull back, have underwriting guidelines, et cetera. It's really hard to say overall, how it will affect us, but we'll do things to understand it better and protect ourselves better.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.","Crystal Lu","This is Crystal Lu in for Ryan Tunis. For our first question, can you please talk about what is driving the increased severity trends in the parts of your commercial auto book that are seeing higher losses? And why those drivers or characteristics are not impacting the healthy portion of your commercial auto book?","Tricia Griffith","I think the primary driver of a lot of the severity is medical costs, and they are affecting the book overall, whether it's auto or commercial auto, it's just more pronounced in the for-hire trucking.","Crystal Lu","Okay. And can you also talk about which parts of the commercial auto reserves you reviewed in September and which parts of the book are going to be reviewed in fourth quarter? And maybe whether or not you pulled forward any reserve reviews when you found some trends of increasing severity in certain parts of the book?","Tricia Griffith","Yes. I'm going to let Gary Traicoff, he's in the audience. I'll have him come up because he will know specifically what he's reviewing and, ongoing, what we're going to review. But I would tell you, just as he gets -- comes down here, we review a big portion of the book of our entire organization on a very frequent basis to understand that we're reserved. And when we think there's any trend that we see, we really want to strengthen the reserve. And that's why I wrote my letter this quarter to make sure that we knew we were strengthening because we saw those, and we wanted to get out in front of it. Gary, do you want to add?","Gary Traicoff","Sure. Everybody, I'm Gary Traicoff, Chief Actuary. With respect to commercial auto, we review roughly about 90% on the reserves in commercial every quarter. And bodily injury, for example, where we took the $25 million increase, we look at every quarter. So from the perspective of are we changing the ways in which we're looking at the reviews in terms of timing. No. We cover pretty much everything every quarter. The other 10% would be more of our smaller coverages such as collision, property damage, et cetera, that might be reviewed a couple times a year. In general, just to give you a sense as well, we -- across all of our products, we would look at about 80% to 85% of the reserves every quarter. So we are touching them multiple times through the year. And then most of our injury coverages, we will hit those four times a year.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks, Gary.","John Sauerland","I'll just add, while we're on that topic. Again, referring back to our last quarterly webcast, John Barbagallo and\/or Karen Bailo. I forget exactly which shared a chart with you all around commercial auto prior year reserve development from, I believe, 2012 through 2018 and showed what Progressive had developed and what the rest of the industry has developed. And I will give kudos to Gary Traicoff and team in saying that the Progressive dots were fairly close to the 0 line. Not always on 0, obviously, we're not going to be perfect all the time. But within 1 to 2 points every single year. This year, we're a little over 2 points year-to-date. And the industry was an average that was far greater, and in some years, was even experiencing 9 points of prior year development. That level of reserve accuracy helps the product managers in commercial auto price accurately. We also reserve down to, I think, a finer level than some of our competitors in that space. So again, that drives more accurate prices that makes us more profitable and more competitive in the marketplace. So we have had some development. It's a little higher than we've seen historically. I think the product managers in commercial lines in the appropriate areas are right on top of taking rate, as Tricia was mentioning, it is their job to do. And I think they've got great data to make sure they're doing it in the right place.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt with William Blair.","Jeff Schmitt","Could you provide us with an update on your efforts to move into the small business market? Obviously, a pretty big opportunity. But any details you can give on your growth outlook there?","Tricia Griffith","Yes. We see, obviously, the growth outlook we see as extraordinary, but it's really too early to talk about. So our focus is on the 30 million small businesses with 20 or fewer employees. And we just rolled it out in the agency channel. And so we're going to continue to learn. When we have anything to tell we will, but we believe that really fits in our opportunities and we're excited about it, but nothing really to tell yet.","Jeff Schmitt","Got it. Okay. And then just a question on catastrophe losses. They've been left out the last three or four monthly reports. And then looking in the queue, I think they're close to $160 million in the third quarter. It's obviously very useful to look at those sort of underlying loss trends with those backed out. But should we expect those to return to the monthly results? Or are they going to be sort of left out going forward?","Tricia Griffith","Well, we've had a long-standing sort of policy that we will put cat information in the monthly reports if it's 2 points or more on the combined ratio. And so that's been decades old. And so we doubt we'll change that. We feel like we're pretty transparent with the monthly reporting and with, obviously, we share a lot during this webcast. So the likelihood of us changing that, I think is low. We'll always consider it, but that's really kind of the -- where we delineate when we share it on a monthly basis versus a quarterly basis.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","Well, that really swept my question, but I do want to at least throw in a vote for including the information. Because that way we'll be able to have a better read on what's going on. I understand that you're not expecting to change it, but I did want to urge a reconsideration. I wanted to get your comments on the softening of the softening in personal auto. And to see if you can break down whether -- like how much of to be expected Progressive response is to maybe pull back on the modest rate decreases you've been taking or to anticipate improving top line growth -- or policy organic growth, I should say.","Tricia Griffith","Yes. I mean, we always look to improve on top line growth. We took really modest decreases across the board. And it really was to balance out that growth and profitability in terms of getting higher conversion. Just watching the competition and seeing the whole industry, when you combine everything, things have been pretty stable. And in fact, you have seen a couple of our competitors take a few small increases. And that's what we think about when we think about trends and we're watching severities. Like, okay, if this is turning, how are we positioned? And we believe that we're really well positioned because we didn't say, okay, we have this margin, let's take huge decreases to take on -- to take on growth or maybe not take on growth commensurate with those increases. ","We're very deliberate in understanding, okay, if we take a little bit, how does that convert to balance that great margin, but also that great unit growth. So we feel like -- and the softening of the softening, that's just John and I talking in the hallway because we're like, what do you think? And we'll look at numbers together. We are just going to watch that surgically. And what I would say is, we're in a really good position because we are -- we feel really good about our rate to not have to take huge increases. If we need to take increases across the board, we always will. But again, if we do, and the trend continues to be able to take smaller increases. And of course, I'll have the caveat we always say, that could be different in terms of states and channels and products, et cetera. Do you want to add anything?","John Sauerland","[Indiscernible]","Tricia Griffith","Is that good?","Meyer Shields","Yes. On my end, it is. I had a quick follow-up question, if I can. I was just curious, when we look at the responsibility relationships between auto data and Homeowner data. I was wondering whether the claims that don't necessarily reflect responsibility, is there any relationship there?","Tricia Griffith","We're just looking into that in terms of sharing data with, specifically, only and only Progressive Home with Progressive Auto. But we do see there's overlap. And so there's some interesting just components that we're looking at to better understand how to segment. So yes, there is a relationship. I don't have a lot to talk about with it publicly now, but yes, we're definitely seeing that sharing that data is gathering insights for both auto and home.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber at William Blair.","Adam Klauber","Could you give us an idea how the -- how your digital acquisition is expanding? Just any ballpark over the last three to five years, how much of your auto -- personal auto business is coming through the digital channel, whether it goes to your agents internally to sort direct? What was it like 3 years ago compared to today? And then where are you on the homeowners and bundled as far as your digital rollout?","Tricia Griffith","I would say, the acquisition on the digital side -- I can't tell you exactly percentage, has increased substantially over the years compared to when you look at mass media. We're assuming we actually -- you don't know if somebody sees it if they end up calling an agent. So we believe it likely helps the direct side more often because it may be a different kind of customer who's looking online versus going into your agent and kind of wanting to sit knee to knee for the that consultation. But I would say, it's -- I know that it's increased substantially. I don't know the exact percentage. ","And then with Home Bundle, we continue to change our message. So forever, it was auto. And our assumption was that when you bundled that it extended auto PLE. What we're finding is from -- when we do the ads where we talk about home actually or auto, that helps to measure that bundle. So I would assume that happens again on the digital side. It's hard to say because you have so many ads coming your way, what actually makes that happen. But we have increased on our spend in the digital portion of our media spend.","John Sauerland","To that, I would add -- by far the majority of our auto sales now are digital, and that has continued to climb, as Tricia noted. I think the other important trend there to understand is the majority of those are now mobile. So it's amazing to me, frankly, that so many people are willing to buy their insurance on their mobile device and that trend doesn't seem to be abating either. That trend has yet really to transfer to home as much. We're starting, as Tricia noted, to build the capabilities for people to efficiently quote and buy property insurance online. We're seeing some interest in the mobile space for property. But the property -- I mean, sorry, the auto trends are pretty amazing and very digital and very mobile.","Tricia Griffith","And I was talking about, he was -- John added on the acquisition side. And I think I was interpreting your question more as the advertising, which we, of course, equate to acquisition. But again, we believe that what we're spending with Home will eventually go that way as well. So for years, people didn't buy digitally. On our HQX, our HomeQuote Explorer, we now have Progressive Home, the buy button, in 12 states. We'll have 14, we're expected to have 14 by year-end. So just to continue to make it easier, have less questions, all those things. We're going to continue to invest in that because we believe that will go the way of auto and just trying to make it easy, especially if we have data that is publicly known that we can help to guide the coverage for your home.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore.","David Motemaden","Just wanted to get an update on the process improvements in the 5 states where you were addressing some of the BI severity on the auto side. And sort of how those are progressing? And when we should start to see any improvement there?","Tricia Griffith","Yes. So a couple of things. We've done some deep dives. And there's a couple of things that we've tweaked, nothing substantial. We really see that it is inherent in the industry. And in the spirit of transparency, as we've kind of looked and stepped back and we do a lot of audits across the board in our claims organization. I would say, it's likely now more low double digits. And so we see that even more in the five states that we talked about before. In looking at the industry, we believe that it's really just inherent with increased medical costs. ","We've also seen an increase really over the years in a attorney rep rate. Not necessarily litigation, but having the attorney there at some point in the claim, sometimes at the actual first notice of loss. When I looked back at data around March 2013, we started to see increase in auto countrywide. And I would say, from 2013 to now, there's been about 6 points of increase in ultimate attorney rep percentage. And so for us, we're seeing that. Obviously, when you have an attorney they need to get their fee, so it's going to be more expensive. And that said, we haven't seen a huge increase in general damages, more on the medical side. So we feel like it's more usage. We've seen more injectables, et cetera. ","So what we're really trying to dig into is, is this a trend? Is there something we can do about it? Because if someone's treating and they're with an attorney, we can't necessarily influence that. We always try to get out in front of the customer to make sure we take care of them and walk them through the process because it is very emotional when you're injured. But some people get attorneys right away, which does make the ultimate cost more expensive. Again, not necessarily litigation, but attorney repped. So we're working on those things all the time. But really, as we have watched the results come in for this quarter from the industry, it seems very consistent with what everybody is seeing in terms of higher medical costs.","David Motemaden","Got it. Great. And just switching gears. I noticed in the queue, there is just some discussion of a higher portion of bundled auto policies that have 12-month policy terms. Just wondering how you think about this going forward as you shift your mix more towards the preferred segment? Are we going to see this continue -- the 12-month policies continue to increase? Any sort of difference in profitability in those products versus others? And I guess, just how you view -- it obviously can enhance retention if your mix moves in that direction. But then it also kind of prevents or limits your ability to reprice as quickly based on experience.","Tricia Griffith","Yes. That's true if you were following us back in 1999 or 2000, but we are very cognizant of being able to be nimble when you have 12-month policies. One of the things when we went with Progressive Home in the agency channel is we wanted to make sure, for competitive reasons, too, that we could have yearly policies on the home for the agents, which was consistent with the other preferred companies that they were purchasing. We watch those very closely and make sure that -- especially because sometimes they'll get multi-policy discounts. We watch this closely to make sure that we maintain profitability and flexibility. We do have a higher percentage of those, which we think it is good when you're priced right. But again, we watch it closely, and we'll continue to likely talk more about that.","John Sauerland","One fact that I'd point out on that question. As Tricia noted, we had some bad experience back in '99, 2000, where we overweighted our annuals. And we learned from that. And today, we don't price our annual policies, generally speaking, at twice the 6-month. We actually price them higher than that to offset or mitigate the trend risk that you mentioned. So we are, yes, growing. It's still not a large percentage of our policies, and it's just in the agency channel right now where we have annual auto policies, and we think we're managing it pretty well.","Tricia Griffith","And I think, too, I just -- I've been -- I've had a couple sessions with some big agents. And we have been really for years, wanting to make sure that we're seen as the preferred company or 1 of their preferred companies in agency. And with that, for them to get bonuses, their loss ratio has to be within a certain percentage as well. So it's -- it behooves them to put on really good business.","Julia Hornack","I'm going to finish up with maybe another one or two questions from the webcast. The first one is can you quantify the improvements you've seen so far with Model 8.6 in the five states where it's been rolled out?","Tricia Griffith","Early read is that it's doing very well. Again, that's early, but we're happy with the results.","Julia Hornack","Okay. And then the last question I have in here is what is the growth prospect for commission income at Progressive? So this is the service revenue line in our income statement. This investor makes the assumption that it's typically a high profit margin and is given a high multiple by investors. So what will Progressive do, if anything, to highlight this expanding revenue stream of the company?","Tricia Griffith","Well, the commissioning that we get from a lot of non-affiliate carriers that we work with -- and I think Andrew talked about the life insurance company we work with, which is great. But we also offset that to make sure that we fund what we call the Progressive Advantage agency. So we use that sort of that contract spends to fund that. So we continue to grow that because we continue to grow. I don't -- we don't have actually any goal with that. It really is about making sure that we have the right amount of carriers for the customer base that comes into our door. And obviously, we want to be competitive with commissions based on the companies that our unaffiliated partners work with.","John Sauerland","Yes. So the commission revenue is great. You're right. Service revenues are becoming material. But I hasten to remind that the primary intent there is to keep those auto customers longer and to keep the most profitable auto customers longer. So the commission is great. We are also offering Progressive Home in that same space, but the primary intent is to, as we say, bundle and extend. Meaning, get more of the household into the Progressive family and continue to ensure we meet all their insurance needs for decades to come.","Julia Hornack","Great. That actually is our last question for today. So I'm going to give it back to Chris for the closing scripts.","Operator","That concludes the Progressive Corporation's third quarter investor event.

You may ask your question.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning, Glen. I was very encouraged by the last quarterly policy expectancy lengthening that you highlighted in the 10-K. How excited are you about that trend? Do you think that this is a breakout that suggests that Snapshot and other measures you\u2019re taking are working?","Glen Renwick","How am I excited about it? I\u2019ve been waiting for it for a long time, so I\u2019m actually pretty excited and I think the 5%, thereabouts that we\u2019re seeing in the trailing three is really quite indicative of what we hope will flow through. Lots of reasons for that, always hard to pin them down, but general excitement, absolutely yes. ","If you take a look at some of our published materials, you\u2019ll see that the average rate that consumers have seen over the last year, regardless of channel, agency and direct, is about a 4%, which I would tell you to think more in those terms than specific rate changes. So 4%, which means a good number of our consumers are still seeing rate changes that are on the high side of that, so as we mature into the rate revisions that we\u2019re now becoming even more comfortable with and rate levels that we\u2019re becoming more comfortable with, I would look forward to seeing while continued positives, maybe not quite in the 4 range but a closer distribution or a tighter distribution around the average, so we will potentially benefit even more so on retention, not losing those higher end or the right-hand distribution around the average of 4 last year.","So really nice movement getting our new product into the marketplace, getting a rate level that we feel very comfortable with, maintaining that. You might remember we said at our IR meeting we had a strong preference for three 1% changes than one 3% change. All of that really is a big part of how we\u2019re trying to make sure that retention is front and center in all of our thinking.","So nice to see it coming through. Frankly, I would tell you I\u2019ll be disappointed if that didn\u2019t continue.","Bob Glasspiegel","Okay. Switching gears, Bill, the first quarter we\u2019ve seen sort of a stressful investment environment. Are you--maybe you can update us on how the fixed income has performed and the stress lines in? Are you taking this as an opportunity to increase risk, or are you de-risking on the portfolio?","Glen Renwick","I\u2019ll let Bill jump in there.","Bill Cody","Sure. We are taking this as an opportunity to increase risk modestly. We\u2019ve increased the bid in the corporate exposure, a little bit in CMBS as well. Some areas we\u2019ve decreased risk, and that would be primarily munis because those have traded really tightly and very opposite to the rest of the fixed income markets, and also we\u2019ve reduced some of our high yield exposure because the high yield that we own has performed really, really well, to the point where it\u2019s trading at spreads similar to triple-B paper. ","So for us, we\u2019re in a good position to take some risk, and we\u2019re finding some more compelling opportunities to do that.","Bob Glasspiegel","Thank you.","Bill Cody","Performance-wise, we released our January numbers, which--our total returns. We\u2019ll release February in a couple weeks.","Operator","Just as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone.","Our next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Josh, your line is open. Go ahead with your question.","Josh Stirling","Hi, sorry - mute button. Good morning. I appreciate you taking the call. Would love to ask you a question about the status of Snapshot. Over the past six months or so, you guys have announced you\u2019ve been rolling out a new smartphone app, and I think at the last annual meeting you walked us through that you were iterating the pricing designed at discounts up front. I guess I was curious, just wanted a bit of an update on how many states you\u2019ve rolled these things out with, as well as more importantly what\u2019s been the consumer response, I guess both from the app, which feels like a different consumer interface and is kind of a question of adoption and comfort and just sort of more open-ended questions about that - you know, how consumers like the app and whether perhaps it\u2019s something we\u2019ll sell, and then separately on the discounts, what kind of lift have you seen from this? Is there impact in conversion rates and maybe on new sales? Thank you.","Glen Renwick","Yeah, we haven\u2019t done a little Snapshot update for a while, so let me see if I can hit all of those points and give you some flavor of what\u2019s going on. Starting into this year, we\u2019re still seeing our policies initiated with the Snapshot influence - discount, whatever it might be, to be faster than the rates of growth that you\u2019re seeing as we report on aggregate, so it\u2019s still our fastest growing sector. That remains true for a long time, but certainly even into January that was true. Starting to get a feel for what sort of mix of business is attainable. ","So I\u2019ll just give you a quick look here, not to confuse you with any numbers, but in our direct book of business, where we\u2019ve been able to offer Snapshot, and realistically there\u2019s only two states now, California and North Carolina, where we\u2019re not offering it, but over a period of time with a cohort where the Snapshot has been available, that cohort of business is now approximating about 40% of the direct business for places where it was available for some period of time. So think in terms of can the little train really take momentum? We\u2019re looking to sort of 40 to 50% in the direct channel.","I think I\u2019ve told you before, the acceptance in the direct channel far exceeds the agency channel, and with the new change that we made - it was very clear that we were hoping to see agency uptake on the--or the quotes include Snapshot with that discount [indiscernible] what I\u2019d call overly dramatic movement, but significant on the small base. Actually, we have some good news to report there. We actually introduced it into two, what I\u2019ll call higher average premiums states - Florida, Louisiana, and we\u2019re seeing the agent acceptance rates there, or the agent penetration into new quoting actually go up significantly, so probably approximating somewhere in the league of half to two-thirds the rate on our direct channel. So starting to make some traction there, and we\u2019re going to take a closer look. I think we did a better job of rolling that out to agents in those states who will take a close look at what we did well there, and make sure that we reinforce that in other places in the country. ","So net-net, pretty good sized penetration in our direct book, and I don\u2019t want to project what the threshold might be as to overall penetration, but to think in terms of more than half of the book is not unreasonable based on what we\u2019ve experienced to date, and now we\u2019re starting to see opportunities where the agency business perhaps is, yes slower, but certainly starting to close some part of the gap, so good stuff there.","With regard to the app, we\u2019ve discussed that. I want to make it very clear that we\u2019ve had apps that have approximated in one way, shape or form the activity for some time. That\u2019s not been an issue. The issue is really making sure we had an app that we felt had the data integrity that really matched with the in-car dongle, and we\u2019ve got to the point where we actually have that application and very comfortable with it. There are all sorts of stories, some of which I\u2019m not as close to as others, but you need to be able to determine the difference between a train ride and a plane ride and a car ride. You need to know whether the person got in the left door or the right door, are they driving, are they passenger. All those sorts of things are actually very important to us, so it\u2019s easy enough to create an app that does part of the job, it\u2019s very hard to create an app that does the--or gives us the level of integrity that we\u2019d be comfortable swapping out for the information that we get from the dongle. ","We think we\u2019re there. Unfortunately, it\u2019s probably going to take us a little longer to get that into marketplace than we might like. There\u2019s a fair amount of work to do on the IT side, but certainly in \u201916 we expect to see that roll out, but it may be for all intents and purposes in large numbers later in the year. I think we\u2019ve probably mentioned we have a relationship with GM and OnStar that\u2019s been a little bit delayed, but we expect to be marketing that more actively in about the midyear time frame. ","So Snapshot, for lots of reasons, continues to be something very important to us, not only as an indicator of the sorts of things that we think we\u2019ll do more of in the future, but it\u2019s really taking hold and you all know the power of Snapshot relative to a rating variable, so ultimately when we start talking about penetration numbers that are really in the range of that 40, perhaps even 50%, it starts to make a difference in terms of segmentation. So we couldn\u2019t be more happy with what we see, I just don\u2019t know what the high water mark will be. But we\u2019re going to find out, and I hope it\u2019s really high.","Josh Stirling","Thanks Glen, that\u2019s really helpful. I wonder if you could just touch briefly on your other big product development initiative, rolling out a combined homeowners product in the agency channel. Give us a sense of--I think you\u2019re live at least in a couple of states. It\u2019d be useful to have a little bit of color for how agency\u2019s responding, what kind of traction you\u2019re getting, and then maybe if you\u2019d be willing to walk us through what your goals are for the program as you look out over the next year.","Glen Renwick","Sure, and maybe I\u2019ll double team here with Tricia on a couple of points. Platinum is what we\u2019re talking about, and this is in short--I don\u2019t want to repeat things that were already written down, but in short it\u2019s the way that our ASI property business and Progressive come to the market, looking as if they are simply one. So let\u2019s not worry about the brand names, but the agents are seeing that as Platinum, we\u2019re in 12 states, we expect to be in an additional 22 this year, so that will give us some really nice penetration. Our goal is simple - our goal is to be a valid and almost significant choice inside the agency channel for those customers who want to bundle their auto and home together. We\u2019re comfortable if they start either way, but we really like the bundles. ASI is seeing about 50% now of their new quote volume being bundled, so we really--we\u2019re not going curtail in any way, shape or form mono line of either, but our real interest is in the bundle. We know what the effect of long-term retention there can be, so those things are great.","Our interest is making sure on the agency channel we offer a really viable option and a, as I put it, must-have solution for agents. We know we\u2019ve got a great auto product - I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any dispute on that. With ASI, we have a great homeowners product. We\u2019re going to work together to put that into a great package, and there is still work to be done so we don\u2019t think we\u2019re across the finish line. We probably never will get across the finish line, we can always make it better.","On the direct side, while ASI is not a big a player on the direct side, that\u2019s obviously a future option that we have for going forward. ","Tricia, maybe you could talk a little bit about the sales force and how we\u2019ve [indiscernible] the sales force to make sure that we get the message out as well as possible.","Tricia Griffith","Yeah Josh, I think to what Glen said, before I\u2019d say that, we really--you know, first of all, the second half of last year, getting the product out, the AT product was really important to get that preferred business and then continue with stable rates. Then we had to have both an agent and a customer value proposition, so we know we needed to add more commissions for these preferred customers, match policy terms. Then as we started to talk with our ASI partners, we realized we really needed to combine sales forces and have very specific sales reps that work with our platinum agents. So we\u2019ve just done that recently and we\u2019re very excited about that, and we continue to--we have 12 states out. We have continued to understand where we\u2019re competitive, when we\u2019re not what we need to do, and I think agents understand that.","We really want to make sure that we reward our agents not just with more commission but with preference, so when they choose us as number one or two--in fact, just this week John Sauerland and I are able to make some calls to agents that have reached some certain levels. We have hurdles to get over determining how many bundles you have in your agency, so while the data\u2019s in with 12 states, I would consider 2016 really the year of execution, understanding more and more about, again, how to get that low pure premium business and how to integrate the right sales force with these very specific agents.","Josh Stirling","Great, well we\u2019ll stay tuned. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Just as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone. Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. You may ask your question.","Ian Gutterman","Hi, thank you. I guess first just a quick numbers question. When I was looking at your stat surplus for the end of the year and your leverage, normally obviously you\u2019re closer to three times. This year, you\u2019re at about 2.7, which I\u2019m assuming is the homeowners change, obviously. Just when I back that, if I kind of took your normal auto premiums divided by the 2.9 to 3 times and solved for the rest, home was coming in at about 1 times levered. Is that a good proxy? ","Glen Renwick","John, jump in here. You\u2019re right - the 2.7, a little bit influenced by the home. We would probably prefer to run the home business at more like 1.5, and I expect over time as these things, sometimes you get a little bit off, but think in terms of we\u2019re going to try to maximize on auto at about 3 to 1 if we possibly can, where we can - it never works out perfectly, and closer to a 1.5 on the homeowners business.","Ian Gutterman","Okay, that\u2019s what I was wondering. Okay, great. Then on the reserves, I guess just first quickly on the January average development, normally--so I guess I\u2019m going back a tiny little bit here. There used to be big favor for leases in January due to sort of the catch-up from the prior December, and I recall you changed that process about three or four years to smooth that out. This January, we saw the lumpiness just in the other direction. Is it still the same process, or do we make a change in process back to the old way?","Glen Renwick","We\u2019ve got Gary here. I think the IB&R was the process change coming off the table, so I\u2019ll let him take it away. But the unfavorable that you saw in December, I would--I don\u2019t want to be cavalier about it, but I would tell you, don\u2019t be too concerned about that. If that had been February over January, then it wouldn\u2019t be prior year. It just happens that it\u2019s the calendar close and therefore you see prior year development come through.","As we looked at our January development for \u201916, there was really nothing that was surprising over the prior year, so we\u2019re pretty comfortable with that,","Gary, why don\u2019t you put some more details there?","Gary Traicoff","Sure. This is Gary Traicoff, Chief Actuary. To your point, about three to four years ago we did make a process change, and then the last few years looked fairly stable. What happened this past January was really due to more late reported claims that happened in December. They got reported in January, and if you think back to the end of December, we did have some storms come through, particularly in that last week or so. So in January, we just recognized more late reported losses, which was really the driver of the development in January.","Ian Gutterman","Got it, and Gary, while I have you, if I can clarify one other thing. I was looking in the K. On the reserves, it said our net reserve balance assumes that severity for acts in year 2015 over 2014 will be 4.2% higher for personal auto and 9.2% higher for commercial auto. I was trying to contrast that to earlier in the K when you talk about calendar year severity and give your frequency and severity stats, and the calendar year severity was, I guess, 3% for PD, 4% collision minus 2VI. If I sort of weight those, I get a very low single digit versus the 4.2 on the accident year. Is the difference between that low single digit and the 4.2 reserve releases, or is there some other way to interpret that?","Gary Traicoff","That\u2019s a great question. Related to that, when I think of calendar period severity, which is what the low numbers you were talking about, our calendar period severity that came through in the year was fairly low, particularly in VI, it was actually negative. That was really the driver of why our reserves developed so favorably in 2015. ","When we think ahead and going forward, we don\u2019t anticipate long-term severity will continue to be negative like that, so if we look at what we actually have booked in our reserving models, we are anticipating roughly a 4% severity going forward on liability. Now, that will include VI, PD, et cetera, so if you do all those cuts by state and by line, most of them are in the 2 to 6% range, but overall it rolls up to about 4. ","When I look at commercial lines, it is about a 9%. Some of that, though, relates to mix changes in the business marketing targets we have, so if you normalize for that, think of it probably closer to a 6% range or so, which was actually fairly consistent with our commercial line severity in 2015.","Ian Gutterman","Got it, and do you have something similar for that where the accident year frequency wasn\u2019t just used? ","Gary Traicoff","We did not report anything in there for accident year frequency. Typically though, calendar year and accident year frequencies are fairly well aligned. You\u2019re not going to have as much of a disconnect as you might have on the severity side, particularly with the VI and the long-tailed coverage.","Ian Gutterman","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Just a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone. Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask your question.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thank you. I guess back on the product, a couple of quick questions here. First, how PLEs looking so far with respect to the customers you\u2019re getting, and then on that also, I\u2019m just wondering, Glen, is there an opportunity here, given the consolidation we\u2019ve seen in the mass affluent market, that you could potentially go after that right now?","Glen Renwick","Brian, could you just give me the second part of the question again, the consolidation piece?","Brian Meredith","Sorry, yeah. With what we\u2019ve seen this far with the consolidation in the high net worth or mass affluent market from a homeowners perspective, is there an opportunity for you guys to really go after that, because I know agents are asking for new carriers there. ","Glen Renwick","Great. Let me take that first. I think we\u2019ve shown you at some prior IR meetings, and we\u2019re more than willing to show you as we get more and more information, that the bundled customer really does give us that notion of a meaningful - and I\u2019m going to stress that, a meaningful extension on our life expectancy. In my shareholders letter, I started to use some language that I think will become more common inside Progressive, moving away from policy life expectancy to customer life expectancy. I think you get that - it\u2019s really we are looking to at least a piece of our business, and I stress that - we\u2019ll still always do the pieces that we do well, a piece of our business being customers that actually stay with us in a reasonably long period of time--or actually not a reasonably long period, a very long period of time, and have multiple products.","So a way to think about that, so yes, we are seeing--yes, that was our hypothesis, yes, we\u2019re seeing it, and the data is solid and meaningful. I think quite frankly, we might even be understating the customer life expectancy yet, because we haven\u2019t seen that kind of customer for a long period of time. ","Something just internally, and this is just to give you a little bit of a mindset of how we think, we\u2019re starting to, and this is, I would say, something that 30 years ago certainly was not on our radar screen, what percentage of our customers have been with us for more than 10 years. Now, we have a meaningful double-digit, let\u2019s say around 15% of our customers that have been with us for more than 10 years. That wouldn\u2019t be a number that would impress USAA or State Farm, I\u2019m sure, but relative to the repositioning of Progressive, that\u2019s a number that\u2019s very important, and the type of customers that we\u2019re seeing go into that state of decade and decade-plus customers are the bundled customers, so nice stuff there.","With regard to your question on the high net worth, I\u2019m going to be very frank. We\u2019ve got a big agenda in front of us and we\u2019re going to probably play in something below the high net worth customer, just put it out on the table exactly that way. That doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t make some phone calls and have other people\u2019s product to sell to those high net worth customers, at least on the home side, but that\u2019s probably not the focus that we\u2019re going to add to our property business anytime in the immediate future, given the very large market opportunity there is for us that we feel very comfortable realizing.","Brian Meredith","Great, thanks. Just one other one. Any changes that we could think about with respect to your reinsurance program?","Glen Renwick","We\u2019ll go through the reinsurance renewal. Trevor\u2019s actually here, but in the June-July type time frame and--John, correct me if I\u2019m wrong here, but no, I expect that we will take reinsurance with our property business very, very similar to the way that we have taken it in the past, at least for the excess layers. We may and likely will reassess some small part of a quota share. That really isn\u2019t necessary from our perspective going forward, but in terms of the layers, we\u2019re not looking to take higher in risk any greater than we have taken in the past, or ASI has taken in the past, and that was never the objective. The objective is to get more customers in the door. We\u2019ll take a reasonable amount of risk, but we feel very good about the amount of risk we\u2019re taking and don\u2019t intend to extend that.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thanks for the answers. ","Operator","Thank you. Just a reminder, if you\u2019d like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may ask your question.","Meyer Shields","Thanks, good morning. I have a few questions just to understand your reporting. Let me use one example. So you have in the K, there are direct renewal application changes that were 5%, I think, for the year. In earlier quarters, it\u2019s 7%, 7%, 8%, so should we look at that 5% as just a modest dip from the 8%, or is there a bigger dip in the fourth quarter that gets us full year to 5?","Glen Renwick","Want to take that, John?","John Sauerland","Sure, I can take that. Recognize we do have a calendar year that in some years has more weeks than in others, so in last December of \u201914, you might recall we had an extra week. We put that in a December release for you, so. In that release, I think we also normalized the premium for the month for you to give better perspective there. I would not interpret that at all to be a dip in renewals. The PLE is what you should be looking at to understand trends in terms of customer retention, and as we discussed earlier, we\u2019re seeing good changes there. I think you\u2019re just seeing a reporting anomaly, nothing material.","Meyer Shields","Okay, that helps a lot. Thanks for clarifying. Second, if we look at the property side, so if I\u2019m doing the math right, you acquired $220 million of reserves and released a little bit more than 30. Is that sort of 15% a good representation of ASI\u2019s reserving philosophy?","Glen Renwick","No, I\u2019m going to sort of answer that a little bit more generically. One of the things that I am delighted about in the first nine months of being together is that we feel, and I think ASI feels that we have some skills to offer, and clearly they have product and skills to offer as well. But one of the places that we were able to actually dig in together is on the reserving side, and we now have an actuary that has been on our actuarial staff working directly for Trevor, the CFO of ASI, but also having very direct line or dotted line, whatever we want to call it, as an integral part of our reserving group. During the course of that nine months, we applied some different techniques, we looked at data a little bit more specifically to ASI versus industry data that had been done before. There was no right or wrong, there was just we\u2019re digging in, in a way that perhaps is a little bit more intense, a little more reflective of the way Progressive has done reserving. ","In this particular case, it turned out we had some releases. It could have been the other way. We would have adjusted either way, but I would tell you that the reflection of the releases this time is a little bit more from a highly intense review, overlaying some models, overlaying some techniques, looking at data, looking at it more frequently, and I expect going forward - obviously I cannot guarantee anything, but what I expect going forward is we\u2019ll be much more on a glide path of the kind of approaches that we take traditionally with our auto business, and I suspect the volatility will reduce. So probably one-time volatility that is reflective of that process, but frankly it\u2019s a great opportunity for us to really work together in taking a look. I have to say it\u2019s always nicer that it\u2019s a release, not an add, but frankly I feel much better that we\u2019ve had the deep study and everybody is very comfortable.","Meyer Shields","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Just a reminder, if you\u2019d like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Your line is open. Go ahead with your question.","Jay Gelb","Thanks and good morning. Now that you\u2019ve gone through the year-end 2015 process, I just wanted to get your updated views on why you feel Progressive is not being impacted nearly as much on the personal auto side as a result of increased miles driven translating into worse claims frequency trends, like we\u2019re seeing for essentially the rest of the industry.","Glen Renwick","Jay, I might challenge the right of the industry piece there a little bit. Notwithstanding that frequency was up, we\u2019re reporting sort of across the board 2, 2.5. I don\u2019t think that is dramatically different than the PCI reporting part of the industry. Fully note that there were a couple of very large and very notable competitors who know perfectly well how to calculate frequency, they reported high numbers, and that\u2019s just a fact. I can\u2019t necessarily know, other than at least in one case probably a mix adjustment that really needed to be made to sort of normalize those numbers, but I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re the anomaly on that relative to the industry.","With regard to--but to be fair, any time - and I mean this sincerely - any time we see anybody else seeing something that we\u2019re not seeing, trust me, the radar just goes off like crazy and we make sure that we\u2019re not the ones waiting too long to see that kind of effect. But as it\u2019s played through from an order perspective, we really didn\u2019t see a great deal in frequency. We didn\u2019t see any major trends. We saw it up a little bit in the third quarter, but for the most part that 2, 2.5, not bad. Now, remember systemically long term, we think maybe frequency is headed for a reduction for lots of reasons with vehicle technology. ","Miles driven, no question that that would be the usual suspect for increase in frequency, and to the extent we didn\u2019t see it as much as some others, I would also tell you that our most recent reporting on mileage increase related clearly to gas prices, we\u2019re starting to see the second half of \u201915--or we did see the second half of \u201915 be a lot less dramatic of an increase over the prior year than the first half of \u201915. Our most recent data points might suggest that we have hit sort of the threshold of miles to be driven. I think we\u2019d be better off waiting to the spring and summer to see if we get another spring and summer effect, but for the most part, the more recent data points we\u2019ve seen, up to and including January since we get very real-time data, is that \u201916 mileage is not dramatic, or not even different from \u201915 mileage, and we\u2019re seeing that even in the last data points of \u201915 over \u201914.","So the incremental, yes, there was incremental first half of \u201915 that was very measurable, quite notable, 3 to 5% on a month-to-month basis, but we\u2019re starting to see that level out. We still see in the mix of miles driven a little shift, about a 1% shift still to trips over 15 miles. We\u2019re not seeing anything dramatic in seasonally adjusted braking rates, probably not a statistic most other companies talk about, but something that we\u2019re particularly interested in. So net-net, the gas price change may have played its way through. I\u2019m going to say that with some ability to retract my statement next time we talk in May or whatever, so stay tuned. But I would just correct that maybe the rest of the industry didn\u2019t see the frequency quite as a high as perhaps an Allstate and Geico, I think are the two that come to mind when we see that, and certainly the two that took rate that was more reflective of that.","Jay Gelb","Glen, all the miles driven trends you were just talking about, that\u2019s based on Progressive\u2019s own data? ","Glen Renwick","Yeah, we use the Snapshot population to see if we can get--we\u2019re kind of nutty about this. We even look at it sort of daily, weekly, whatever frequency we can, because these are the sorts of things that for years we\u2019ve reported even to you, we don\u2019t always know what drives frequency. You don\u2019t always know what drives severity. Well, now we actually do have at least one proxy for frequency, and miles driven is something we can measure. So it\u2019s only a piece of the puzzle, but we\u2019re pretty obsessed with trying to get it.","Jay Gelb","I can imagine that. The only other thing I wanted to touch base on with regard to what some large writers of the industry and personal auto are seeing with regard to deteriorating margins, so if the frequency impact that Progressive is seeing is not inconsistent with that of the industry, why do you feel that Progressive\u2019s personal auto margins haven\u2019t been really impacted at all?","Glen Renwick","Well, that\u2019s probably a longer story, but let me suggest to you that - and we\u2019ve done this on many, many calls, I\u2019ve always said when we see situations that make us believe that rates will go up, we tend to take it early. It wasn\u2019t that many years ago that we took, and talking in aggregates is not always the best thing but it might work for this, we took rates up and frankly some of the trends didn\u2019t materialize to the degree that we thought. Our penalty there is that we actually grow a little slower with healthy margins. ","However, in more recent times we\u2019ve gotten to a rate level that we thought was appropriate, and perhaps others weren\u2019t quite at that level and therefore needed to take their rates up more. So the starting point matters, and that was sort of my point before. I like to think that we\u2019re trying to ride the crest of the breaking wave. We want to stay on the crest all the time. When you fall over the crest and your margins start to deteriorate, typically that\u2019s associated with a big hammer of rate, and we all know the implications of that to retention, to NPS, and to growth. The trick for us is really staying on that crest and, as I mentioned earlier, as opposed to looking at rate take by rate filings, which you could look at a premium-weighted adjusted basis, you\u2019ll see that the industry is about 2.5 to 3.5 last year, some exceptions to that for sure on the high side and low side. But I would always draw your attention to sort of what is the realized average premium, and you see in our case that was about 4% in both channels.","We have ways that I\u2019m not going to get into in great detail of making sure that we build in some trend into our rating factors as well, so that doesn\u2019t always come through in the published rate changes. So our objective is really to stay on that crest of the wave, and answering your question, it depends on the starting point, so we were not inadequate and didn\u2019t need to take a big rate increase, and we actually have been taking small bites of the apple and we\u2019re going to keep taking bites of the apple. My expectation is in the first quarter of this year, we\u2019ll take about probably the better part of a point, at least in our direct channel, and maybe close to that in our agency channel, so we\u2019ll always take that kind of a rate. I\u2019m not going to speculate for the whole year, but it might be sort of slightly below the 4%. ","Ian asked the question before about severities, and while we did have the fortuitous situation of severities going down and therefore we could release reserves based on the negative severity trends we saw, I will tell you one of the first lessons I ever learned in this business was people don\u2019t get less expensive to fix, so we certainly don\u2019t plan negative trends into our pricing indications, and we\u2019re much more likely to reflect the kinds of numbers that Gary talked about going forward.","So long way of saying, but our job is to stay on the crest of the wave, and the good news is that we are not currently in the position of taking a significant hammer to our rates, or haven\u2019t had to for some time, and if we can stay on that crest of the wave without falling over by taking small bites of the apple, that\u2019s our objective and that produces some very nice outcomes. ","Jay Gelb","That\u2019s great, thank you.","Julia Hornack","This is Julia. I just want to remind everyone that if you\u2019d like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone. While we wait to see if anyone else is calling in or has a question, I just wanted to make a quick housekeeping announcement, which is that for those of you who would like to join us at our investor day this year, we will be holding it on the afternoon of Thursday, October 6 in Mayfield Village, Ohio.

That presentation will be followed by a Q&A with our CEO, Tricia Griffith; and our CFO, John Sauerland. Our Chief Investment Officer, Bill Cody will also join us by phone for Q&A.

We are delighted with our first quarter results growing net written premium 16% at 88.8 combined ratio, really great start to 2019 especially after several years of profitable growth.","Today's webcast is going to be a little bit different than what we have done in the past. We have focused the recent webcast on our operational strategies and how they help us make investments to ultimately achieve our vision.","Today, we're going to talk about the investments side of the house. Before we get into that I want to step back a little bit and just make sure we are all clear on our overall objective function and now it's for both the operating side of the business and the investment side of the business. We want to grow as fast as we can at or below at 96 combined ratio as long as we can service our customers.","The great news is, we have been achieving that goal many times over the last several years, 2016, we grew 2.8 and net written premium 2017 another 3.8, last year 5.4 and comparing quarter one of 2019 with quarter one of 2018, we've already grown nearly 1.3 billion. What that has made us a huge asset under management for our investment firm to invest of about $35 billion and of course premium flow is one of the input to our investment strategy.","Progressive Capital Management or PCM as you look here called today is based in Norwalk, Connecticut. It's a 13-member strong a small but mighty team.","It's first talk about overarching risk. We want to balance our operating risk with the risk of financing and investment activities to have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance we can possibly underwrite and service. Within that the PCM organization has three mandates, Jonathan will talk about this; Jonathan and Richard will both talk about this a little bit later in more detail.","The first one, protect the balance sheet. The second, achieve a strong risk-adjusted total return. And the third one, support the operating business as we think about future endeavors. I think about Horizon 3 that I shared with you before. We tend to be more conservative on the investment side because we have chosen to lever the operating franchise because we see it as our most durable means for a really strong ROE. Our comprehensive ROE is measured by a business profitability and capital efficiency.","This Slide gives you a sense of how we look at comprehensive income. This is the pre-tax basis and it is the past five years plus the first quarter of 2019. And each of the bars you will see several colors, the blue is underwriting profit, the orange is investment returns and the small sliver of gray are interest expenses.","As you can see, the investment part of our company is very important and that's why I thought it was important to share with you a little bit more about our philosophy today. As you can see for 2019, it's actually over 50% of our comprehensive income.","We don't have an exquisite comprehensive return on equity goal rather, it's the natural outcome of our operating goals, our investment mandate and our financial policy. So again, operating goal, grow as fast as we can into 96, investment mandate, have a strong total return on our investment; and our financial policies that we shared with you before and that is maintain a 3:1 premium to surplus and then have a contingency layer of capital for unforeseen things that could happen and then have no more than 30% of our total capital comprised of debt. When we have those three working together which we have for many, many years, we are able to earn an attractive comprehensive return on equity in excess of our capital structure.","So now I'm going to get to the heart of the matter and that is to introduce you to Richard and Jonathan. So, they both started out many years ago at PCM. They started out as analysts and quickly moved into the portfolio roles. They both report to Bill Cody who you've met before, so we thought it would be nice for you to meet two members of his strong bench.","Richard Madigan has his BA in Accounting from Boston College and his MBA from University of Chicago. He currently leads our structured product portfolio and he served on the strategy Council that we developed several years ago, and so works closely with Andrew as think about the future.","But first, I'm going to introduce to you Jonathan Bauer. He has his BA in Economics and Political Science from what we Ohioans call the school of North in Ann Arbor and he has his MBA from Columbia. He leads our corporate bond portfolio and he takes the initiative to think about technology strategies to make sure that PCM organization is efficient and effective.","Jonathan Bauer","Thanks Tricia.","Richard and I appreciate the opportunity to give you a more detailed understanding of who Progressive Capital Management is, what our strategy is and how do we fit into the larger organization. To start with, it's important to mention that we only manage the money of Progressive. We do not take in any outside funds as we believe it could distract from our core mission. As of March 31, 2019, we have 13 investment professionals who manage just under $35 billion in assets. That $35 billion is composed of $32 billion in fixed income and $3 billion of equities. We manage the fixed income portfolio on an active basis, while almost the entire equity portfolio is passively indexed to the Russell 1000 Index.","If you look back over the last 10 years, you can see a sharp increase in our assets under management, especially over the last three years. One of the benefits of investment management is the scalability of the business. As you can see, we have only added three members to the team even though our assets have more than doubled. However, that scalability does have limits, and as Progressive grows further, we will continue to make sure we have adequate resources.","Before we go any further, we thought it might be useful to review what the sources of our investment funds are. Starting at the bottom of Progressive's capital stack is our shareholders' equity which comes from the company's retained earnings. Next up is our preferred stock. Progressive issued $500 million of preferred stock in March of 2018 to support our operating growth. Above that, you can see our deck. Some of you on the call may have participated in our two issuances in 2018 as we came to market in both March and October.","Finally, the last two contributors to our investment portfolio, first is the float we make on premiums, next is the reserves we have in place in our insurance business. All of these funds flow up to our fixed income and equities portfolios. I would just point out that the size of these boxes on these slides are for illustrative purposes and are not the actual size of the category.","Now that we've talked about the sources and growth of our portfolio, let's talk about our investment returns and where you can find the components of our returns in our financial statements. We manage our portfolio on a total return basis. So, what encompasses that total return? First is recurring income. This flows through our operating income and comes from the interest income that we earn on our fixed income portfolio and the dividend income earned in our equity portfolio. This is one component of our total return.","Second on our slide is realized gains or losses on both portfolios as well as holding period gains and losses on equities. Now what does it mean for a gain to be realized or unrealized? We realize a gain when we sell a security at a price above where it was purchased. A gain is unrealized when a security is trading above the purchase price, but we have not sold again. As you can see, these gains and losses flow through our net income. I do want to point out that it was only last year in which holding period equity gains and losses started flowing through our income statement due to changes in accounting standards.","Moving on to the last component which is unrealized gains and losses on fixed income. This is not something that you would see on our income statement, but instead flows through our comprehensive income. As stated earlier, we measure ourselves by our total return, which encompasses income realized and unrealized gains on the fixed income portfolio.","I have mentioned earlier that we have 13 investment professionals. On this slide, you can see how we've structured the team. We have four individuals including Richard and myself who report up to Bill Cody, our Chief Investment Officer. The four individuals are broken up by corporate bonds, structured products, treasuries and short-term, and economics and financials. Beneath these four people, we have a team of portfolio managers and analysts who help to drive our strong performance. It's important to note that this is the current structure of the team. But as I will speak to you later in the presentation, rotation through different sectors is a core tenant of our investment philosophy.","While our team is small, that has not prevented us from achieving outperformance versus the overall market. While our compensation is not driven by outperformance of a benchmark, we thought it would be useful for demonstration purposes to compare us to the index that most closely matches our investment constraints. As you can see, there has been consistent outperformance on a three, five and 10-year basis. And on the following slides, I'll provide you some of the broad hallmarks of our group that we think have helped drive that outperformance.","We think there are certain aspects of our investment team that are unique compared with other fixed income investment managers. The first one, I would want to point out is our flexible mandate. As mentioned earlier, we measure our performance based on our total return. Therefore, our purchase and sale decisions are in no way influenced by the book yield of the security. We have the ability to purchase both high-grade and high-yield securities as long as we ensure that our overall portfolio rating does not drop below A plus. While we showed our performance versus an index on the previous slide, that was purely for illustrative purposes. Our security selection and asset class allocation are in no ways meant to match an index. Further, the size of our different portfolios whether they be corporates or mortgages are in no way fixed. So, we can adjust them based on the best opportunities that the market provides us.","As I mentioned earlier, a core tenant of our team is the rotation of analysts and portfolio managers through different sectors. So why do we do that; don't we give up a lot in terms of specialization? We think the rotation adds a significant amount of value to the organization. And in fact, this rotation is something similar to what occurs on the operating side of the business.","To begin with, it offers each individual a fresh look at the risk-return potential of different portfolios. Through this rotation, individuals get a better sense of relative value across different asset classes. While it's a daunting task to get up to speed on a new portfolio every few years, we think it actually helps with both recruiting and retention as it offers a continually challenging position to highly motivated individuals. We feel this rotation not only benefits the entire organization through improved performance, but also creates a deep bench of future leaders for Progressive Capital Management. As Lori mentioned on the last call, part of our culture is to promote from within and this rotation allows individuals to prepare for greater responsibility in the future.","The final component to our unique structure is our incentive system. To begin with, one portion of the incentive compensation is based on Progressive's overall gain share score. As I mentioned earlier, our first goal is always protect the balance sheet and we are incented to do so with such a significant component of our incentive compensation coming from Progressive's annual performance. The other important piece of our incentive compensation comes from the group's fixed income total return on a one and three-year basis versus a group of other fixed income money managers with generally similar constraints.","We point this out for two reasons; one, to show that the team is encouraged to be long-term focused in their thinking and investing; and two, that all members of the PCM team are incented by the group's total return not based on their portfolio size or their individual portfolio's return. Therefore, no one is incented to purchase assets that do not benefit the overall performance and everyone is encouraged to assist other team members because it will end up benefiting them in the end.","We feel like we have created an integrated path within the organization. Our unique strategy helps to drive outperformance which generates more capital for the operating business. This increased capital provides a base for further operating company growth and increases our assets under management and then the whole cycle begins again.","Now, we mentioned on the previous slide the flexibility in our mandate. However, that is not to say we don't have strict constraints in order to manage risk in our portfolio. On this slide, I will talk about some of our more important guidelines. We have a limit of 25% of Group 1 assets in our portfolio at any time. So, what does that mean? Group 1 assets include equities, non-investment grade bonds and preferred stock. The total amount of these three types of securities cannot equal more than 25% of our entire portfolio. Why did these securities get put into Group 1? We view these as our most volatile assets and also the ones most likely to incur a permanent loss of capital. Therefore, it makes sense to have a limit in terms of how much they represent within our portfolio.","We mentioned earlier that we have the ability to buy both high-grade and high-yield securities within our portfolio. That flexibility has benefited our performance over the longer term. However, that capacity to invest in lower-rated securities is not infinite as the weighted average portfolio rating must be at least A plus across the portfolio.","The constraints also extend to our interest rate risk. Our duration is an indicator of how much interest rate risk we're taking in our portfolio. The allowable range for the portfolio is 1.5 to 5 years. However, for individual securities, we will invest out to 10 years. At the end of the first quarter, we had a duration of 2.6 years as we believe there was a higher probability of rates increasing rather than decreasing over the intervening 12 months.","Finally, we feel it's important to have limits on how big any individual position can be in proportion to our shareholders' equity. The limit is 6% for municipal state obligation bonds, for investment-grade bonds the limit is 2.5% and 1.25% for non-investment grade bonds and preferred stock. We believe it is imperative to prevent one idiosyncratic investment from impairing Progressive's capital.","We've gotten the question from investors like yourself many times regarding yields that we're seeing in the market. So, we thought this chart showing yield opportunities in the U.S. fixed income market might be useful. The Y axis of the chart shows market yields on offer, while the X axis shows the total market size of these different asset classes, where you see the blue numbers is the post-crisis median yield for that individual asset class. As you can see, for many sectors that they are at or above their post-crisis median yield, a big driver of that increase has been the increase in treasury rates across the curve over the last few years.","We thought it would be useful to highlight a few of the market yields available on sectors where we have exposure, starting with high-yield corporate bonds, investment-grade corporate bonds, commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and treasuries and municipal bonds. We mentioned earlier in the presentation that our flexible mandate allows us to invest up and down the credit curve. So, when we make the decision to invest in high-yield corporate bonds, what are the characteristics of those types of investments? We look to invest in companies that are high-grade quality. The reason that they may be high-yield is that they have more financial leverage than the rating agencies: Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch might be comfortable with. This provides us with an opportunity to purchase these investments at attractive levels and many times when the companies improve their balance sheets down the road and get upgraded, we see a strong incremental return.","Many times, we also find interesting opportunities within the industries that are penalized for previous issues which no longer exist. The most recent examples in the post-crisis period have been the automotive and housing sectors. Most importantly, what we want to get across is as you look at that table at the right, we only focus on the blue boxes. We're focused on avoiding investments in businesses that we view as weak even if the financial leverage seems relatively low.","Taking it one step further, let's look at a couple of examples of high-yield investments. First up is a BB rated non-cyclical business. The reason why this company will be high-yield is because they have high financial leverage that won't conform to rating agency high-grade standards. However, we view the leverage as sustainable. We could earn 275 basis points, or 2.75% more than treasuries. This would be about 125 basis points of incremental pickup over an investment-grade company. Potential outcomes for this type of bond is an upgrade to investment-grade. We would see about an 8% increase in the price of the bond. There's the potential for no change in price, but we would still get to earn the incremental compensation. And third, would be the potential for company underperformance driving a 4% depreciation in the bonds upon a downgrade. While possible, for the companies that we tend to invest in, we do not see a high probability of that downside outcome.","Now let's look at one more example. Instead of a non-cyclical BB rated name, let's assume we buy a more cyclical B rated issue. In this case, the financial leverage might look optically high because the industry has just recently bottomed. Therefore, the company's EBITDA or cash flow is at a cycle low. On this type of investment, we would expect to in the current environment to earn about 400 basis points or 4% over treasuries. That would be 250 basis points, or 2.5% over a similar maturity investment-grade bond.","In terms of potential outcomes, we could see an upgrade in ratings to BB. This could occur just by the EBITDA, or cash flow normalizing as the industry recovers. In this case, we would see both price appreciation and 400 basis points of incremental coupon. If we see no change in the business, we would still earn an incremental 4%. And in a downside scenario, we'd see an increase in financial risk because of depreciation in both ratings and price. I should mention that an investment like this one tends to occur earlier in the economic cycle as opposed to where we are now 10 years into the cycle.","And with that, I have the pleasure of passing it over to my teammate and partner Richard Madigan.","Richard Madigan","Thanks Jonathan.","So, Jonathan walked you through how we're set up as a group, how we think about value, our performance over time, and how we think about opportunities in corporates. Now I'm going to spend a bit of time going into more depth about how we approach portfolio construction and securities selection including one example in commercial mortgage-backed securities before wrapping up and moving to Q& A.","Most basic question that we ask ourselves on a regular basis at PCM is, do we want to take more interest rate risk or credit risk? And as is the case with most questions, the answer is typically, it depends. In general, we look for asymmetric risk-reward relationships in which we believe the upside is greater than the downside.","As fixed income investors, we are particularly sensitive to downside scenarios and will generally look to stay away from low probability with high severity downside situations. We'd like to say that the upside takes care of itself if you're focused on protecting the downside.","This chart plots the path of the 5-year treasury note against Progressive's duration positioning over the last 10 years. As a reminder, duration is a proxy for how much interest rate volatility we are willing to take on. As Jonathan mentioned earlier, we have a guideline of 1.5 to 5 years on our duration, 1.5 would be taking the least amount of rate risk possible and 5 would be the most rate risk, mathematically putting our midpoint somewhere in the 3.25 range. As you can see in the chart, we've been lower than our midpoint and in fact very close to our lower bound of 1.5 on taking interest rate risk for quite some time, for the very similar reason that U.S. interest rates have been historically low coming out of the financial crisis.","You can also see that our duration positioning has come up more recently as the Fed has increased rates and moved toward a more neutral policy position. While we are closer to our own duration midpoint of 3.25, we're still short of that mark. Key indicators that we watch closely to inform our duration positioning include inflation, a multitude of economic indicators, rate movements themselves and Fed commentary. As always, we will be watching these indicators closely in 2019 and beyond to inform how we position our duration for rates going forward.","In addition to interest rate risk, the other major question we ask ourselves constantly as a group is, how much credit risk should we be taking on? And the answer once again is, it depends. It depends on where we are in the economic cycle, where valuation, also known as credit spreads are and it depends on the capital needs of the company.","This slide shows our Group 1 assets as a percentage of the portfolio over the last 10 years which is roughly the length of the current economic recovery. As a reminder, our Group 1 assets are a rough proxy for our general risk appetite because Group 1 contains our most risky assets, high-yield bonds, preferred stock and common equities. Coming out of the financial crisis, valuations were quite attractive.","As you can see from the chart, we maintained a Group 1 exposure very close to our 25% constraint for a number of years. There are some wiggles in there which were mostly related to intra-year capital planning activities like share buybacks and our dividend payment, but for the most part, we saw it as a good time to take risk from the standpoint of both valuations and the economic recovery. As the economic recovery is continued, risk assets have performed well as expected and valuations are no longer as compelling as they once were.","Additionally, there's the risk of a downturn at some point during which fundamentals and valuations will both likely take a hit. We don't know exactly when that will occur, so we've taken some chips off the table in advance. Our Group 1 assets have steadily come down over the last several years and we're currently running at 14.3% of the portfolio as of March 31. We're defensively positioned right now. And we hope to capitalize on more attractive valuations when markets get cheap. And they always get cheap at some point often very fast and without warning. We want to be ready for those type of opportunities.","Turning now toward our portfolio in aggregate, we thought it would be helpful to show our portfolio composition against the widely followed index, the Bloomberg Barclays Intermediate U.S. Government Credit Index. There are few differences that I would point out between our portfolio and the index. The first of course is that our portfolio is really the output of bottom-up security selection, not the result of top-down asset allocation. While we do discuss relative valuations across asset classes frequently to inform where we should put our resources in the short-term, our portfolio remains a bottom-up fundamental portfolio.","Turning now to a few examples of how our portfolio differs from an index. I will first point out the allocation to U.S. treasuries. In the index, treasuries make up 60% of the portfolio whereas cash and treasuries made up 39% of our fixed income portfolio at March 31. Second, you can see in the highlighted orange box that we have a significant exposure at 26% of our portfolio to securitized products. Securitized products, also called structured products, are bonds that are backed by common loans such as car loans, home mortgages, credit cards or commercial real estate mortgages. I am personally biased because I oversee securitized products for Progressive, but I believe that we have great domain knowledge in this space and it will likely continue to be an important asset class for us over time.","Finally, I'd like to point out the duration differences. The index currently has a duration of 3.9. That would be at the longer end of our duration range of 1.5 to 5 and we would be taking on higher than average interest rate risk if we were to map to the index. As you can see in our portfolio, our current duration is 2.6 resulting in lower than the index interest rate risk. You can see the contrast between our portfolio and an index even more starkly in our corporate portfolio. The left pie chart shows the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Intermediate Corporate Investment-Grade Index and the right pie chart shows our corporate portfolio as of March 31.","The first major difference you can see is the difference in allocations to financials. The index has 40% financials exposure while our corporate exposure is 23%. We do broadly see value in financials and we take targeted risk to financial institutions through both our corporate portfolio in the 23% you see here and our preferred stock portfolio where we think there are number of attractive securities.","The second difference I would point out is our exposure to consumer non-cyclicals. Consumer non-cyclicals are a broad category containing things like healthcare and consumer packaged goods. We have spent considerable time researching both of those industries and we feel great about our 30% portfolio weighting versus the index weighting of 15%, particularly as we get closer to the end of a long economic expansion.","The last difference I would point out is our smaller than the index exposure to the energy industry. We have approximately 3% in energy versus 8% for the index. The rationale for our smaller exposure is that we're very mindful of the volatility of commodity price movements and our inability to predict those movements. As a result, within energy, we skew toward stable subsectors like pipeline assets. While our positioning limits our upside during commodity price spikes or risk-on markets, it substantially helped us during the big high-yield and energy sell-off in 2015 and '16. As mentioned previously, we are focused on protecting our downside and we worry less about giving up a bit of upside in euphoric markets. I haven't shown duration on this chart, but our duration is lower than the generic index. As a reminder, we manage our duration at the aggregate portfolio level the rather than at the individual asset class level.","I thought I would spend some time describing how we think about security selection in two of our major portfolios, corporate bonds, which Jon overseas and structured products, which I oversee. They include things like asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities.","If I were to summarize our corporate bond strategy, I would say that we're looking for great businesses with great management teams and stable industries. So how do we do that in a bit more detail, first, we look at the industry structure. All else equal, we prefer more mature industries with some level of consolidation, stable pricing power and no major threats from emerging technologies. When we look at management, we look for a strong track record of doing what they say they are going to do. We will not invest in companies with known questionable ethical track records. We have in fact sold securities after attending meetings or conferences with management teams that left us uncomfortable.","Management compensation is a powerful tool that directly drives behavior. We look to ensure that management compensation is aligned with stability and conservative debt management and not with a specific accounting metric that might encourage lender unfriendly behavior. EPS and sales growth, those are examples of broad compensation metrics that could encourage things like large M&A activity which is generally a negative for bondholders. Cash flow. cash flow is where the rubber hits the road for the credit investors. We either look for stability over an economic cycle or strong tailwinds in the cyclical recovery. Cash is king. We love the Benjamins.","Predictable capital allocation policies. Management has a number of choices in capital allocation. They can invest in the business, pay down debt, pay dividends, pursue share buybacks or pursue M&A. We prefer debt paydowns or business investment first and we look for predictability and stability in dividends, buybacks and M&A.","Performance during the financial crisis. We have a great built-in stress test for how companies perform in a sharp downturn. If it's available, we always look at performance during the financial crisis even if the business has changed since then. It's a great data point.","Finally, as Jonathan mentioned earlier, we look for catalysts that could drive credit performance. One key catalyst that comes to mind is whether the company is a potential acquisition target. If they are a strategic target for well-capitalized competitors, that's great. That could cause their bond prices to rise potentially significantly. If they are target for a debt fueled type private transaction, that would generally be a negative.","Another asset class that's very important to our portfolio is structured products which I rotated on to and have overseen since 2016. Again, structured products sometimes referred to as securitized products are bonds that are backed by cash flows from everyday assets, things like car loans, home mortgages, commercial mortgages or credit cards, everyday stuff in the real economy. Because not everyone on this webcast may have the same level of background in structured products, I thought I would use a simple example of car loans to help visualize how these securities work and how we think about them.","Structured products typically start with a product we're all familiar with in our daily lives such as auto loans. In the case of this example, the process starts with a consumer purchasing a car and taking auto loan. Millions of buyers purchase cars every month making this an important market. Auto loans are typically extended by a bank or a consumer finance company such as Ford Motor Credit. The banks and finance companies have a choice. Do they hold these loans, or do they sell them to free up capacity to make more loans? When they sell them, that's where structured products come into play.","When enough loans are made, the bank or finance company sells those loans into a trust. The trust receives the cash flows and security on those loans and then the finance company working with an investment bank creates and sells bonds to institutions such as ourselves. These bonds are typically enhanced by various forms of what is known as credit protection to shield them against defaults and losses in the loan portfolio. It sounds complicated, but these products have long track records and work well through the ups and downs of the economy.","So, what do we look for when we evaluate a deal? First, we look at the reputation and track record of the issuer. How long have they been in business; how have their assets performed; do they do what they say they will do? Next, we look at the underlying asset class. Car loans to prime buyers had been a very dependable asset class. But contrast to autos might be something more esoteric like aircraft finance or shipping containers which are considerably more difficult to analyze and predict. Next, we look at the underlying borrowers. We look for quality and reliability and statistics such as FICO score, income levels and geographic diversity.","And finally, we look at the structure of the bonds themselves. Structured products are typically issued with built-in credit protection. The most simple example is the bond ABC example, I have highlighted here. In the case of a typical deal, bond A would be senior to bonds B and C, in case the trust started to incur losses from defaulted car loans. If you make bonds B and C large enough, bond A can survive even the harshest stress test which is what we look for.","Last point I'd like to make about structured products can be summarized through a simple example. Unlike corporate bonds in which we are analyzing one company, structured products often contain hundreds or even thousands of underlying loans and mortgages. As a result, we have to rely more in statistical testing to underwrite the credit quality. And as Mark Twain was rumored to have once said facts are stubborn things, but statistics are pliable. We couldn't agree more and we reflect that in our analysis.","This chart shows two-illustrative normally distributed borrower pools that might exist in a typical securitized deal. Both of them have a seemingly identical creditworthiness as shown by an average FICO score of 740. If you knew nothing else, you would think these are both high-quality borrower pools. However, it's not the average that we are after, but rather the dispersion of the FICO scores and the size of the left tail which represents the lower FICO score borrowers with higher default risk. As you get below the roughly 660 or so FICO scores subprime cut-off, that default risk rises exponentially. So that's were you're exposed as a lender. In the left chart, FICO scores have a wide range from 580 which is considered deep subprime to 900 which is pristine. You might think that having pristine borrowers in your pool is a positive, but that merely helps the average of the pool without improving the loss potential of the lower quality borrowers. Mark Twain would probably furrow his substantial brow here. The right chart has a much more narrow dispersion. In other words, all FICO scores are closer to the average than the left chart. The pool ranges from just under 660 that rough subprime cut-off, to just under 860. While this pool doesn't have any 900 FICO score borrowers, statistically speaking, a 900 FICO score borrower isn't much different from an 800 FICO score borrower in terms of probability of default. So, we would strongly prefer to invest in case 2 which contains a significantly smaller left tail and probability of sustaining material credit losses.","Now, I'm going to run you through a quick example in commercial mortgage-backed securities which I will refer to as CMBS going forward. There's a lot going on in this chart, so I'll try to break it down for you. Before I describe this slide, the punchline is that we like to deal on the left and we chose not to purchase the deal on the right. CMBS is really a tale of two markets. The depiction on the left is an example of the single asset single borrower market which is a fancy way of saying each deal contains only one property and that property is often a very high quality such as Trophy New York City office building on Park Avenue. Loans are typically also backed by large sponsors such as publicly traded REITs or other large well-known real estate investors.","That depiction on the right is an example of a conduit. Conduits are deals that contain multiple loans usually more in the small to medium size range. Properties and conduits can range from things like regional malls, to suburban offices, to self-storage facilities. Sponsors can range from high-quality sponsors, to small local real estate investors.","If we were to stop there, it would seem to be enough to convince us that the single asset single borrower market is of much higher quality and it typically is. However, it gets a bit even better from there. The single asset market is also known for its lower leverage which results in more protection against losses. By way of comparison, if you look at the skinny blue bar on each chart known as the single A rated tranche, you can see they are protected from losses from all of the bonds and the equity beneath them. In the case of the single asset deal, the property's value would have to go down by a stunning 68% before the single-A tranche lost money. In the case of the conduit deal, the bonds are protected from a loss of value of 47%. Now both are substantial cushions, but think back to the quality and resiliency of the underlying assets. On the left, you have that Trophy New York City office building backed by a deep-pocketed sponsor. On the right, you have a set of lower quality properties with lesser-known financial backers and therefore more volatility and more downside.","So, is this all too good to be true? Why not? Always just buy the quality single asset deal. Well, if you look at the numbers circled on the track, these show credit spreads that you receive as investors and you do get paid more to hold the conduits bonds, higher compensation for high risk. In the case of the single asset deal, you would receive a spread of 100 basis points or 1% over LIBOR. In the case of the conduit, you would receive treasuries plus 215 basis points or 2.15%. While you're certainly getting paid more to own the conduit, we believe the better risk-adjusted return through both economic ups and downs is in the higher quality asset. You can either eat well by getting paid more to own the conduit bonds or sleep well by owning a single asset deal. We prefer to sleep well at this point in the economic cycle.","So, how are we positioned now? As mentioned in an earlier slide, our Group 1 risk assets are at 14.3% of the portfolio relative to our 25% constraint. That's on the low side for us as you saw from our 10-year chart. Cash and treasuries make up 36% of the total portfolio and 39% of our fixed income portfolio. And our interest rate exposure is lower than the midpoint of our duration range.","In short, we feel that we're conservatively positioned and ready to take advantage of market opportunities as they present themselves. What will we be thinking about going forward? First and foremost, we will continue to support the company and its mission to grow as fast as possible at 96 or better combined ratio. Second, we're watching the risks out there, things like unexpected inflation, or signs of an economic downturn. And we're always mindful about what we're focused on, it's unlikely to be the actual problem. Black swans absolutely do exist in our experience.","And finally, valuations are fair at best right now. These things can change suddenly as they did in 2015, '16, and December of 2018. We will focus on staying nimble with the goal of going on offense and buying cheap securities when others are playing defense.","So, in summary, we believe our team is rock solid. We have significant investment experience through economic ups and downs, we have a great culture, and we're tightly integrated with operating business. Our mandate is clear, support the business. We do this by focusing on protecting our balance sheet first while pursuing the best risk-adjusted returns we see in the financial markets. Our model is flexible. We can shift the portfolio rapidly when we see opportunity and we're focused on generating total returns without having to worry about accounting or other metrics.","And finally, our compensation plan is simple, company gain share and our performance against our peers. We'll work toward the same common goal of generating one aggregate portfolio return.","Thank you very much for your time. And now we will pause and transition to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Julia Hornack","[Instructions] Joel, can you please introduce our first participant from the conference call line please?","Operator","The question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Mr. Kinar, your line is now open.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. My first question is around severity and then I have a follow-up. So, with regards to severity, I clearly saw an up tick in the BI severity in the first quarter. And physical damage severity is also continuing its creep up. I guess, do you have any thoughts as to what's leading these increases now of all times as opposed to say the last I don't know a year or two years, three years? And what actions could you take in order to offset some of that other than raising price?","Tricia Griffith","Yes. on the physical damage the portion of it, we are still seeing the component parts are more expensive. So, that continues to be pretty clear as cars get -- as the technology gets more advanced. So, we can price that pretty quickly. On the BI side, what we did is we took kind of a deep dive into that trend. Mike Sieger, who is our Claims President has a group of people and they did a deep dive and have narrowed down the BI severity to seven specific states and specifically we look at segmentation and claims like we do in product, specifically soft tissue, attorney rep claims that aren't litigated.","And we're actually seeing the special damages increase, not the general damages. So, think of general damages as pain and suffering, the specials as medicals. So, what Mike and his team are doing is they're taking another deep dive right now into those seven states to understand and have hypotheses to prove or disprove so they can take action, are the specials, is it more frequency of bills or more severity; is it the fact that we've grown a lot, so newer people? So, more to come on that. But Mike is all over it and literally we've gone through a lot of data to understand that BI severity so that we can correct any actions from our process improvement perspective.","Yaron Kinar","Got it. Okay, we'll keep track of that I guess as we've. Then my second question is around PLE. So, I think in the 10-Q you mentioned that you've made some targeted underwriting changes in the new product model and that's what's some of the PLE erosion. Can you maybe explain what you're trying to achieve by these changes? And I don't know if you'd be able to quantify what portion of the PLE decline came from those changes specifically?","Tricia Griffith","I touched about this at a little bit in the last call. A big portion of some of the decline in PLE was the process change that we made. And the reason we did it was for our lifetime underwriting profit goals. So, we had process in place. It was basically a timeframe that you could renew without a lapse. And when we looked at that timeframe, one, we thought it was too long because we were able to tell that those customers were not profitable. And when we narrowed it down, one, we're more consistent with the industry; and two, we make money on those customers. So, we knew we would lose those customers and that would decline in PLE. And I think two, and I can't necessarily quantify specifically, but we have our usage-based insurance and as we continue to evolve that model and we have people that are surcharged, they tend to leave as well. So, a couple of different components. But the process change was the biggest component. We should see that diminish a little bit after the second quarter after it's gone through the book.","Yaron Kinar","Thanks so much.","Tricia Griffith","Thank you.","Julia Hornack","Joel, if you could take --","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Mr. Phillips, your line is now open.","Mike Phillips","Thank you. Good morning. I want to hit on I guess my first question on the other side of the loss side and frequency. And this is not a new topic obviously, but you said in the past that that you don't price for the frequency changes, the favorable frequency. I guess I want to understand that a little bit better, if that's what you said and kind of why not if long-term trends and short-term trends are still very favorable, kind of talk about why you're choosing not to price the latter, it's what you meant by that?","Tricia Griffith","What we don't do is we can't -- there are so many macroeconomic trends that go into frequency. So, severity we can pretty much pinpoint what we think is happening, where frequency, it could be vehicle miles driven, it could be our mix of business on the book, it could be gas prices. So there are so many things that go into it. It's hard to have the specific input. So what we do is, we watch that trend to see what's happening, but it's much more difficult than severity. Do you want to add anything?","John Sauerland","Sure. Yes. We absolutely price the frequency. We have a frequency assumption that's forward looking to some degree driven obviously by the past. I think our previous statements have been that the frequency assumptions we made for forward-looking pricing weren't as big of a decrease as we've seen. So, we didn't price for the level of decrease in frequency that we've seen, we have been assuming smaller frequency declines in our pricing. But not again as much as we've seen recently.","Mike Phillips","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. Second question on the commercial side, commercial auto, can you talk about what you see in terms of different loss experiences for I guess your core commercial versus kind of the ride-sharing business?","Tricia Griffith","Yes. I mean commercial also has five different what we call BMTs. So, it is across the board from a tow truck to a sand and gravel hauler. So, they are very different across the board. And TNC is a higher frequency I think because they are in more of an urban areas. So, I can't give you specifics on that. We're look at that specifically with each of the BMTs, the TNC will look at state, we look at especially in the bigger states where there's a lot of construction going on. So, it varies dramatically. It would take me quite a while to go over it. I am going to have John Barbagallo who runs our commercial business attend the next webcast because I think he can go into a deeper dive on how we look at that product from a profitability perspective and a growth perspective.","Julia Hornack","Thanks Mike. Joel, can we get the next question from the conference call line please?","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Ms. Greenspan, your line is now open.","Elyse Greenspan","Thank you. My first question, Tricia, in your Shareholder Letter, you mentioned that there are some signals of a softening personal auto market. I was just hoping that you could just give us a little bit more color on what you are seeing and how you guys are kind of trying to combat that and just kind of policy growth thoughts given expectations that the market could be a little bit softer?","Tricia Griffith","Sure Elyse. So, let me give you sort of a little bit of the punchline. But, let me walk back and walk you through how we have been thinking about for the last couple of years because we have a lot of tenure at Progressive and we've seen hard and soft markets come and go. So we're just seeing less price movements, so whether it's less rate take or actually many companies are taking slight decreases, so there's just less shopping. So, people are satisfied with their rate, less shopping.","But let me walk you back a couple of years ago because as we have this robust or have continued to have this robust growth in profit, what we wanted to do is we wanted to take a look and say, okay, during times where there was a soft market, what are the things that we did or didn't do that we would want to do differently in this next market. And of course, things always change, so it's never the specific point in time. But a couple of years ago, we did -- about 1.5 year ago we did a deep dive into saying, okay, what would we do differently and sort of kind of gauged that around our operational strategies to continue on this growth. Because we really enjoy this great growth and profitability and we wanted to continue and we want to set ourselves up to continue that. So just recently as we've seen less rate take in the market, less shopping in the market, prospects are a little bit more challenging to get where we have great conversion now., so that's what has enabled us to continue to grow. We got together our group of people, Pat Callahan, our Personal Lines President, got together just to have a summit to say, okay, what -- how are we going to get out on front of this while we're in this really great position to continue this? So clearly, we continue to increase our marketing. And we're having a lot of unique marketing where actually you'll see something new next week from us with our specialized lines of motorcycles in particular product that a new campaign we are excited about. And we're looking at different ways to market in different areas to get the customers that we desire.","On the agency side and I wrote about this a lot in my letter, we've done a lot of investments for the agents and we are really trying to focus on agencies that we believe can continue to help us grow that may be haven't grown as much as other ones and work with them on our product and our systems to have them sell more Progressive, making Progressive number one or two in their firm.","And the overall, I think when we think about combating the soft market, I think about what we talked about for years. And that's the whole destination era strategy. Obviously, we invested in homeowner's company and we have many other unaffiliated partners that we work with, so making it easy for our customers. So HQX we have a Progressive home buy button in eight states now and we have other unaffiliated partners we work with to make it really easy to buy that home and connect it with the auto.","We also have and we talked about this a lot. When we talked about the destination era, a lot of people that are going to graduate ultimately they have an auto and may be a renter's policy now they are going to graduate. So how do we market to them? We have metrics that we look at in the destination era that we look at auto plus another product. And when customers have more products and they are able to have our service and on the claims side and the CRM side and they like it, likely they're going to have more products. And if you compare the auto plus one metric from March of this year to March of 2018, we're up about 8.5%. So that's actually just kind of scratching the surface. Pat's team and actually teams around the company are working on, okay, what do we do? And we're just seeing slightly softening, so we want to really get out in front of that to continue to set ourselves up to ensure a profitable growth for some time to come.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That's very helpful. My follow-up which is I want to go back to the severity conversation from earlier when you had mentioned there are seven states that have really kind of been a red flag for you guys. Are those states that you've grown -- that the growth was greater in over the past few years than other states that would may make you think that maybe it was greater growth?","Tricia Griffith","I would say about half of them are. So, yes, we have grown so much in every state. But yes, there are couple of larger states where we have grown tremendously and that's where we are really taking the deep dive to understand and create hypotheses to get our arms around it.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks Elyse.","Julia Hornack","Thanks. Joel, can you take the next call from the conference call line please?","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Mr. Zaremski, your line is now open.","Mike Zaremski","Hey, thanks. Follow-up to one of the previous questions about the targeted underwriting changes that will continue through the second quarter. Are those changes behind some of the underlying loss ratio improvement and I think the last quarter on the call I asked you guys about that. You said it was due to business mix changes. And I'm curious if this is a major component to that?","Tricia Griffith","These are really more process changes. Our underwriting is a little bit different. It would be a portion of it, I don't think it would be a huge amount. A lot of it is our ability to make sure that we care about expenses deeply. Our mix of business continues to change. I didn't mention this when Elyse asked the question, but we are seeing our agents more and more floating us the preferred business that we are starting to come to enjoy. So, it's a portion of it, I wouldn't say it's a major portion of it.","John Sauerland","And most of our underwriting activities are focused on incoming customers. The process change that Tricia mentioned was the renewals, so obviously in force customers with us, but the predominance of our underwriting efforts when we talk about them over the past I don't know five years or so have ensured that we are getting accurate information from people coming in the door and risks whose intent is truly to ensure.","Mike Zaremski","Okay, great. And my last question is regarding your ambitions to grow into small business, commercial, and BOP. In terms of the playbook, I'd be curious, is the majority of your current commercial auto book, is that sourced through brokers? And two, in terms of the BOP business you are selling today, are you privy to the underwriting and loss ratio data that is ultimately going on to the third-party paper that you're using? Thanks.","Tricia Griffith","So, the majority of the BOP already now is from unaffiliated third parties. So, we just rolled out our -- and sold our first policy on Good Friday for our BOP coverage. And we're going slow as we want to understand the system implications et cetera. So, we have it in Ohio handful of agents, we're going to add on more agents in May and then continue the roll. So, it would be slow and methodical just to make sure that it's a good process for the agents, a great product for the customer et cetera. So, slow and steady. What we're happy about is that we invested in this a couple of years ago because we think -- as we think about Horizon 2 initiatives, this is an important piece of it. And again, John Barbagallo will go into detail in the next webcast on what we're doing and commercial. We don't use the data from the other companies those who inform us of what we do. We bifurcate that data.","Mike Zaremski","And your commercial auto book today -- it's commercial auto, is that sourced mostly through brokers?","Tricia Griffith","Commercial auto -- I get what you're saying. Through our independent agents, yeah, the majority of our commercial auto business is -- does go through commercial agents. We rolled out there BQX, the soft launch of BQX a couple of months ago, which is BusinessQuote Explorer. So, we'll continue to have more direct and online, but right now I'd say about 95% of ours goes through independent agents.","John Sauerland","In terms of premium for first quarter was about 84% of premium went through independent agents. So, a slight majority.","Mike Zaremski","Thanks so much.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks.","Julia Hornack","Thank you. So, I'm actually going to take question from the webcast right now. So, this question is from a current shareholder and their question is, what is Progressive's view on investing in alternative asset classes, specifically private equity?","Tricia Griffith","Do you want to take that Jonathan? Okay, we'll have Jonathan Bauer answer that.","Jonathan Bauer","Sure. Thanks very much for the question. We take a very thoughtful approach to all of our investing, at the moment, how we've currently decided to split it out is public equities that we index as I mentioned before, actively managing fixed income. Within that fixed income portfolio, we focused on having more liquid securities as we mentioned in terms of mortgages, treasuries and corporate bonds. We always stay open to looking at other opportunities in terms of alternative asset classes. But, at this point in time, we felt that we'd prefer to stay in more liquid asset classes and have chosen not to invest in private equity.","Julia Hornack","Great. Thanks Jonathan.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks Jonathan.","Julia Hornack","Joel, can we take the next caller from the conference call line please?","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt with William Blair. Mr. Schmitt, your line is now open.","Jeff Schmitt","Hi, good afternoon. Question on severity, it was 7.8% in the quarter, looks to be above the industry or at least at the high-end of the industry, and I think it had been running below for you guys fairly recently. Do you have any sense on what may have driven that shift?","Tricia Griffith","Well, we don't have the industry quarter results yet, so we'll compare after that. But there is the three components that we talked about, the BI severity specifically soft tissue in several states, the physical damage or severity in terms of components and car parts. And then PIP severity went up a little bit based on, I talked about this on the last call on a Supreme Court case with the industry lost in Florida. And that's the main piece. We'll continue to watch it and watch what happens in the industry.","John Sauerland","To that I'd add, we are looking at a quarter and maybe you've seen a couple of other reads from other companies for the quarter. If you look over the long-term, I mean decades or even years, generally you see our severity trends track fairly well with the industry. We are also the subject to the same inflation trends for parts, for medical services et cetera. Where you see our trend diverge from the industry is on frequency. So, our frequency trends have been going up less than the industry over the longer term, or more recently going down more. And we think there's a lot of things that go into that, but certainly we think our pricing, segmentation goes into that, the underwriting efforts that I mentioned previously as well as our shift to a more preferred end of the customer spectrum. So, over the longer term, I think you'll generally see our severity trends similar to the industry, we think if you look over the longer term, again, frequency is where we find the advantage.","Jeff Schmitt","Okay. That's helpful. And just one more on the Robinson's segment. Could you discuss how growth looks there versus the year ago and what your outlook is?","Tricia Griffith","Yes. Growth continues to be strong. We're growing the fastest in Robinson's I think in both direct and agency by a lot. We only have about 2.5% of the home market with our PHA and our Platinum agents. So, we believe that there is a lot of runway there. And we have our agency and team working with our agents to make sure they think about us when they are thinking about auto and home bundle, but that's a place where we continue to be really bullish on our ability to grow and grow substantially which of course the more we have that preferred segment relates to frequency. So, we're really excited about that.","John Sauerland","And on the direct side, obviously we've been putting a lot of new products in place or new methods of coding, our HomeQuote Explorer is a great example where we're making it easier for Robinson's to either graduate to Robinson's with us or come to us as new customers, our advertising mix has shifted toward messages that are geared toward that segment of the population. So, that's helping drive business there. And as Tricia mentioned, getting agents to change behavior around whom they think are Progressive best serving, it takes a while. And we've seen that shift she mentioned earlier in agents coding us we think their most preferred households. Within the independent agent channel, we actually find a lot more potential for Robinson's growth than the direct channel. So, we're really excited about that.","Julia Hornack","Thanks Jeff. Joel, can we take the next caller from the conference call line please?","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Mr. Shields, your line is now open.","Meyer Shields","Great. Thanks very much. Tricia, I was hoping you could comment on whether the growth that you're seeing in Robinson's sector implies that all else equal Progressive is less vulnerable to market competition than five years ago or some prior period?","Tricia Griffith","Yes. I mean it's hard to quantify, but I would say that's one of the reasons why we chose to invest in ASI and invest in relationships with other unaffiliated partners. We know from data when customers have more than one product, their likelihood to stay is longer, their stickiness is better. And we wanted to be -- as part of our strategy, we wanted to make sure that -- and I think you said this in a webcast, I think John Sauerland said, we want to be able to say, yes, we got that, we can get that for you. And so whether it's on our paper or not, yes, I do believe you are less vulnerable if you have more and more products and services that can take care of as many consumers as possible.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. Second question, unrelated. Is the shift to the Robinson's having any impact on the average claim settlement in the legacy non-standard book, in other words, is it changing the mindset of claims adjusters?","Tricia Griffith","No. I mean I would say our claims adjusters and this is I think a little -- couldn't be different than what I've heard from adjusters who are coming from other companies. We focus on every customer whether they are Sam, Diane, Wright or Robinson and make sure we give them the best service ever. So, I don't believe that Robinson's affect the Sam's. Of course, a lot of the Robinson's have higher limits, so that could be a dependent factor as well, but I don't think that has an effect.","Meyer Shields","Great. Thank you very much.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks Meyer.","Julia Hornack","Well, that actually appears to be the last question in the queue. So, Joel, I'm going to hand the -- I'm going to hand it back over to you for the closing scripts.","Operator","That concludes the Progressive Corporation's first quarter Investor event.

So I'm curious, then, whether the forces which have caused the combined ratio to run well below 96% are more temporary in nature. I guess, for example, perhaps, there's an element of \"corrective actions\" following the combined being above 96% in the first half. I know you guys have talked about expenses as well. And I have one follow up.","Glenn M. Renwick","Okay. Fair question. Our rates, clearly, I tried to outline that really extensively in some of the communications, but we've clearly corrected our rates in the midyear. So that is earning through and earnings through at levels that look like we'll be well suited to meet our 96% or below. I wouldn't personally read too much into, like, a January number. There were -- winter months are interesting at best. And in some cases, we had some winter weather that was a little more typical and some that was quite atypical. We even had events that probably took out a, for a large part of the population, almost a weekend's worth of driving. So we don't know if we'll ever be able to sort of get to the point of being able to say that was 0.5 point or 0.25 point or even a couple of points. See, we think we're priced at about the right level for going forward as the nature of rate revisions, you tend to be a little bit spiky, you take a rate revision and by definition, you're taking those rates up to a level that is slightly higher than you might want to if you could bleed the rate level in over time. So -- and I don't want to get too technical here, but we're priced to a midpoint of the rate revision. And so in the early phases of a rate change, we are likely to see a little bit more of an earned premium. As the earned premium comes in, we're likely to see losses, perhaps, reflect a slightly better combined ratio but over the length of that rate revision, we would expect to meet our 96% or below target. So I would tell you, we're right on track but think of the maturing of a rate change. So we take it up a little bit, it matures through. And we're now coming into -- and I don't want to overplay this because the results will be the results, but we're starting to come into a little bit more mature place in our rate revision. I'd add a couple of points to that. So it means that people who are about to renew are now going to be renewing into the rate revision they were last on. And that's an important point because they don't see the quantum jump in rates, which they see the first time after we've taken rate changes. That's sort of what I mean by the maturing of the rate level. We also would expect to see, from the time we've taken our rates, competitive actions that start to make the competitive nature of the rate change a little more favorable to conversion. Did I get at your question?","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, that's very helpful. And then lastly, I noticed that policy holder life expectancy levels for the full year 2012 are well below the levels for the first 3 months of 2012. So I think that implies there was a sharp drop-off in 4Q. If that is correct, what were the drivers and what are the implications for the coming quarter? I guess, for example, does that translate into, perhaps, a sharper PIP decline?","Glenn M. Renwick","Okay. Actually, Brian has something to add, I think, to the past question and probably carry right on to this one.","Brian C. Domeck","Sure, Mike. The only thing I was going to add to Glenn's comment for your first question, a lot of it is sort of the earning in of rate change that it improves sort of the loss ratio. The other thing I would say, which we referenced in the letter and the like, particularly towards the last half of that last year, we did reduce our advertising spend, which was influencing the expense ratio. We have since, at the beginning of the year, come up to more comparable levels to a year ago. So in January, we did ramp up our advertising more so than what we had in the second half of the year since we were more confident in our rate level. And the other thing I would -- which we talked about before, at least in the aggregate, when you look at the aggregate combined ratio, keep in mind some of our specialized products, there's some seasonality in terms of the losses for our specialized products for like, example, boats and motorcycles, much less usage in sort of the winter months. But for the auto perspective, most of it is the rate-change related. In terms of your question related to policy life expectancy, a large part of it -- and the decline in future rate changes we took. And we know every time we measure it in terms of retention rates and renewal rates, et cetera, when we take rate changes, there is a negative effect on that. What I would say is most of the rate changes and most of the significant rate changes we took were more in the late second quarter, early third quarter timeframe. Not all of them, but most. And most of those, as Glenn has mentioned, have cycled through the system such that subsequent renewals will not see as big a rate change as they might have seen in the last several months. So I can't clearly predict what the PLE change will be, but certainly, the decrease was a reflection of the rate changes that we made.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is it -- am I correct in saying that there was a big drop off in 4Q, though, even though you started raising rates in 2Q and 3Q like you just said?","Brian C. Domeck","Yes, the retention rates, since policies for auto -- our 6 month policies, each and every month our cohort of policies are renewing. And so each and every month, yes, we have started seeing lower renewal rates than we might have previously seen. So that would be contributing to the deceleration of policy in force growth, as well as certainly, the rate changes have influenced our new business conversion rates.","Glenn M. Renwick","Just to be clear about that, some customers might see the rate change the day after we make them, and some may see them 6 months after we make them. So it takes a full 6-month cycle, actually, it's even longer than that because there's a little bit of a delay from when we take them to and they are effective for renewals because we quote renewals quite a way in advance, so without getting more detailed on that cycle, I'll just tell you, our cycle now has gone all the way through.","Operator","Your next question is from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","The question I'd like to ask would be -- because obviously, we're talking about the PLEs coming in, conversion rates coming down from the cyclical exchange rate taking. When you look across other larger companies, they also seem to be shrinking units while they're raising pricing and people are still talking about severity. So the first part of this is really just do you still think severity is systemic and this is an issue that's going to work its way through the rest of the system? And then, the question is, when we think about some of the lagging competitors, regional, provincial, perhaps, I'm not asking by name. But broadly, is this something that you think will lead to an increase in the rate base at those firms over the next 6 to 12 months? Or is this going to be a slower story to play out?","Glenn M. Renwick","Let me see if I can get to some of those pieces. Clearly, I think we were pretty clear about what we saw and how we discussed our need for rate last year so the real question sort of becomes, what do we see now? And I would -- let's break it down pretty simply. Frequency, I would tell you not much of a story for frequency. It's sort of -- it's really benign. And if you put a range around not much happening to plus and minus 2, you probably capture everything we know about frequency by almost every coverage, and you're probably even closer than the 2 -- plus or minus 2. So that's good, but it can change at any point in time, so as you know, we watch that very closely. Severity is -- you'll see from our most recent publications, sort of 5 is a number that you can reasonably hang on to. We have some belief that maybe in the bodily injury range, there might be some reason to believe it's a little less than 5, 4, 5. It gets really hard to sort of split hairs on that. What's driving it for us, it seems to be the litigated and non-litigated, but attorney-represented soft tissue claims, and there we're seeing just a little bit of a difference in the general damages or the settlement ratio relative to special. So we sort of have a sense of what we're looking for, sometimes, that can be hard to find, we kind of have our eye on the right things. But I think, for your takeaway, think about severity, trend or inflation, if you like, sort of 4 to 5, and you can put that on collision, you can put that on PD, and you can put that on PD and you can put that on BI. And I think that's how we see the world for right now. To the extent that we are the size we are and have a representative book of business, it would be very unlikely, although, no one ever seems to match perfectly with your estimates of frequency and severity. We are generally all within a relatively close range. If others are experiencing the same sorts of things we're experiencing, and I would just say it's hard for me to see why they would not be, then, it's up to them to decide that their objective function is. But we all know where interest rates are. It would be very hard to sort of think you could openly subsidize a lot of trend in your underlying book of business. And how and when they take rate is sort of their business. I don't think it's hard to trace the bread crumbs of the last 4 or 5 months. You've seen quite a few companies make announcements about their relative rate levels. We track rate level, pretty much a scatter plot of every rate revision we can see for every -- every competitor. And it's clear to us that rates are generally on the rise, but in some cases, more dramatic and other cases, not as dramatic. We're looking closely at all results that are being reported. And we don't know what others will do, but we would be reasonably expecting there are still some rate changes to be taken in the marketplace if people are acting on the same data that we think we're seeing.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's great. That's helpful. The other thing I'd love to just briefly touch on is if you guys can give us an update on your sort of your general thinking on Snapshot. Both, obviously, and sort of iterating the marketing messages you've learned, things over the past year in terms of both how you think you can sort of better position this suite to your customers, it would be great to get some insight on that. And I think we'd also be interested just generally in sort of what your current thinking is on licensing and what kind of response you've had from companies now that you've been positioning sort of your offers with the broader market for a couple of months now.","Glenn M. Renwick","Josh, could you just quickly give me your first part of the question again?","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes. Most specifically, I'd love to get a sense of what you think you've think you've learned about consumer interest in the product and how you're going to iterate as you, obviously, you're keying up a new campaign that we're all dying to see. We'd love to understand sort of some of the product that goes behind it and how do you think the message in media evolves.","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes. I think I tried to put some -- for me, at least, if I say things like some of the most exciting things I've seen, that's like, that's about as wild as I get in my commentary. So Snapshot is truly amazing for a lot of reasons. One is, it is a lot more consumer-friendly because it's a little bit more causal. They relate to that and some of the variables we use, which are a little more car-related. So no issues there in terms of acceptance. We get about -- and these are going to be numbers that you can reasonably rely on, but they will be not necessarily perfect at any point in time to the changes. About 35% of our new business in direct is actually opting to take that, so it's a good percentage. The number is closer to a 10 in our agency distribution. But of very recent times, very recent being, this year, we have actually done again one more push to our agents to see if we can get them even more excited about this proposition. And of recent times, we have had somewhere in the range -- and I don't know the exact number here, but my range will be good enough for this conversation, about 8,000 of our agents actually take us up on a Test Drive which, for us, is very exciting because when they've actually got more of a tactile feel for the product and what it does and how to install it and so on and so forth, we think they're more likely to be confident to be able to push that notion onto their customers. Last results continue to be -- I mean, the data is just so rich. We do sense that we will have product modifications. I think I forecast that even a year ago, that we're going to have to sort of figure out how to bring this into the fold of the greater product. So heretofore, it has largely been a discount and we're going to have to sort of integrate that with the product. I alluded to that in my letter. So lots of work to do, but how do we feel about Snapshot? It's here to stay. There's no question about that and how to use it, there are some drivers and not a small number, that really do get a significant benefit. And as a segmentation variable, it's just clear. It's just so powerful. I mentioned in the letter, so I'll just try to anticipate things that might be on your mind, that Test Drive didn't meet expectations, that's true. And it might've been our expectations that we're wrong. I will tell you that those who have taken us up on Test Drive, we do get at least some of the other statistics that we wanted to understand a little better, of those that take a Test Drive, will they actually put it in? Will they do the whole Test Drive? Will they actually quote after their Test Drive? And are they the sort -- is there some sort of proxy even in their taking it, that tends to suggest that they may be the people that are eligible for a fairly significant discount. We've actually got some pretty good data on that. So while the numbers are not as great as we would like, the calibration and the metrics now are actually quite exciting for us. And yes, we do have some new advertising and probably, if we had to critique ourselves, what we believe is that a lot of consumers sort of understand the notion. I gave you some statistics in my letter. They attributed with Progressive, but they haven't quite yet figured out why are you talking to me. And we will try to do a significantly better job and it will be a little bit more aggressive job in some advertising that will come out early April timeframe, where we would try to make it a little clearer for consumers -- actually, I'll take that back. We're going to try and make it a lot clearer for consumers, sort of the difference between if you're a good driver and you're not, the implications to your rate. So it will be pretty much a little more in-your-face advertising in that regard. And we hope that people will get the clear notion that Snapshot is a solution to a real problem and they'll need to determine whether that's a problem they want to solve. I think your follow-on was with regard to licensing. We've been clear, starting mid-last year, that we intended to license this. We made our commitment to put out some of the details of licensing before the end of the year. We've done that. And I'm just going to sort of probably end there. I will say that we are very conscious of many efforts going on that are not necessarily under the terms of our licensing agreement, and those are best left for us to deal with at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from the Vinay Misquith with Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question is how do you plan to use pricing as a tool for generating growth? Do you plan to use -- do you plan to reduce price? Or are you waiting more for competitors to take rates up in order to generate growth?","Glenn M. Renwick","Vinay, I'd tell you that we price to our cost. So we don't try to price per se. We know exactly how to get growth. But unfortunately, it is that very important combination of growth and combined ratio, and I tried to take a little more time this year in the Annual Report letter. And so that's the combination and frankly, it's the only acceptable combination that works for us. So let me try to be specific to your question, we took rate because we felt we needed to and that best represented our view of current and future costs. We're happy with the rate. There are places, almost inevitably, where we get -- did a little bit off, a little bit over, sometimes a little bit under; and there are some places that we will take some adjustment, but it's less about, specifically, the competitive environment, it's more a reflection of whether or not we are matching price with our costs. So we have actually taken a slight decrease in Florida and in Texas. And these -- Florida, specifically, was a very tough state last year with things that were quite one off situations. PIP was going in a very different direction. We saw a new legislation in PIP. So there were some changes we needed to make in Florida, a lot of moving parts there. And to get that exactly right would have been more than heroic, and we will fine tune there. That's what we do, we fine tune. Second is how do we get growth? We continue to really create a high demand function. And while I don't want to get too far out ahead of the results that were published, I would tell you that our demand, specifically on the direct side, is actually very strong. So the first half of the year or the first 2 months of the year now had very strong demand. Our conversion, because of rate level, is not what it had been at the most optimal point of rate competitiveness in the marketplace. We sensed that we're coming closer to that sweet spot, and it is a function of the age of our own rate revisions coming closer to the midpoint pricing and some competitive action and hopefully, some yet to come. So in short, I'd answer, we generate demand and we're doing really well at that. I'm actually very happy with the demand function, specifically on the direct side. Agency, there's a little more tardiness to the equivalent numbers from last year, but we're in the right ballpark there. So demand, I'm happy with; the maturing of the rate revision, I'm happy with. It may be yet another month or so before we're in an absolute sweet spot. We'll never know that until that after-the-fact. And competitive actions, everything I'm seeing in the marketplace would suggest that the rate will come to us. And if our conversion rate goes up 1 tick or 2, we would be in a very advantaged position.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Just as a follow-up to that on the conversion rate, historically -- and I know that Progressive is very smart. You dropped pricing only if you can grow PIF. What if we actually don't see the conversion rates improve? Would you be willing to let the combined ratio slip more towards the bottom end of the range?","Glenn M. Renwick","Say what you mean by bottom end of the range. Higher?","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Closer to 90 versus 96. So let's say that you don't see...yes. So if you don't see the conversion rate improving would you, then, say that it's a more competitive environment and we'd rather go for profitability versus growth?","Glenn M. Renwick","I'm not -- I'm just not going to go there. We have a great product, we have great marketing and very clear objectives. We want to grow profitably. So I know what you're asking and that just isn't really on the table right now. There's no reason to believe that we don't have a product that consumers want. And as our price point comes in, we think that -- well, they're asking for it, I know they're asking for it already. And while I'd love to have a conversion rate a couple of ticks higher than we currently have, my bet is that we'll see that a lot more, then I'll have to take an action to, say, let's just cheap terms, sort of, eke out more profit. I'm here for a long run with consumers. And I don't want to take that kind of action here for a long run with them. And we've said our preferred form of growth is new policyholders. So I wouldn't be banking on that.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, just to follow-up on that a little bit, Glenn, so it sounds like -- my initial question was going to be, if you want to grow but you're not advertising, how are you going to grow? But it sounds like what you're saying is that there's like a tide level of rate in the industry that's not quite where you feel like it needs to be. So interest is high, but the rate level in the industry is just not quite at that point of where you'll start getting that sort of conversion. I guess, my only question would be, what happens if that doesn't happen right away or this year or in the next 6 months? I mean, are you willing to just continue to let PIF recede until the market kind of clicks with where you think it needs to be? And then, I just have one follow-up.","Glenn M. Renwick","First of all, we're not pulling back on advertising. My letter, to the extent that I clearly indicated that in the second half of last year, and I think your analogy of a tide tells me you're getting this point, we pulled back in the second half of last year. But as I said, there was no good reason, as we were seeing entering this year, to get off of a run rate that's more comparable to the first part of last year. So advertising, we're back on the gas on that. And we have a very valid product and a valid conversion. We're not -- this is not like we're not converting a lot of people. We're still making a lot of sales. A tick in conversion means a lot. I'm betting that, that will come back to us from all the reasons that I've described. So that it's -- to ask the question, how long would we sustain that, is sort of an impossible one to answer. We're always looking to refine things in the marketplace, even at the time -- this is a little more detail than you probably want, even at a time that we took rates up, when we know we have customers that are coming to us, that are not going to meet our profit targets, we also take some other underwriting restrictions. There might be build-plan type restrictions, we may have some early filters that we apply. And as we get rates, we're also able to go back and evaluate those filters. So there's actually a lot more going on than just rate that can help us grow. And I don't see any signs, and as I am seeing data coming in, that would suggest that we're on the wrong track for getting our units back where we'd like them in a reasonable timeframe.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And I guess, just thinking about it, and I know you've talked about inputs, which make sense, and I mean we, unfortunately, kind of focus on the outputs on the earnings side because that's kind of what we see. But if we're here and you're kind of looking at this sort of 96 combined and you reiterated that as kind of an underlying component of your operations and the sort of tide notion in the industry is something you can't really predict, and the portfolio stays where it is. How should we think about what allows earnings to kind of make that gesture back to like '07 levels? If that's something that you think about, or maybe it's not.","Glenn M. Renwick","No. And there's one other point, too, as I broke off. I'll come back to that. But one other point that I broke off, and it's an important point so I'm going to reiterate it. Renewals are a big, big, big chunk of what we do and people renewing into the rate level that they were previously on -- that was a point I made in an earlier question, that becomes a very important point. So just to your first point. Earnings, it's -- not a day goes by that anyone here is not focused on all the same kinds of things that you care about, we care about the same things. We're just trying to be abundantly clear of saying how we will get our earnings. And having a very clear objective function, which is why I took the time in the letter to reiterate that, there's nothing -- there was no new information there, that was a clear explanation of what we already do. We are, everyday, focused on trying to grow our book of business. We want to be a growth company, grow our customers. We have an absolute threshold constraint of a 96 combined ratio that is not something we will violate. And that will be the driver of the operating part of the business. As we will support that with another huge part of our earnings stream in investments, I think we've been very clear about our philosophy in investments. So while instantaneously, we may be in a low interest rate environment, we think operationally, we're in a very good place. And while I kind of hate coming into the year without the momentum that we came into last year, my hope is that we don't have the inflection point this year that we had last year and that momentum will build from here on out. So we're going to continue to be a very strong operating company, grow on the basis that we've given you, and when opportunities for investment income are even stronger than they are now, and I think we had a pretty strong year last year, that will be an absolute delightful add-on.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I want to follow-up a little bit on the investment question, in that how much did you re-examine or think about changing the investment strategy given the low interest rate environment? And I guess, sort of, the second question is somewhat related. Would that change if we have a different type of reporting? We're looking at financial instruments forcing the equity portfolio results on a mark-to-market through your income statement. And would that change how you think about your investment results? So 2 parts to that question.","Glenn M. Renwick","Bill, why don't you take the investment strategy part of that, and..?","William M. Cody","Sure. We think about it every day, and we're always looking for ways to improve our total return of the portfolio, not necessarily just on book yield or a GAAP yield because we do run it on a total-return basis with our goals of protecting the capital of the company and protect our underwriting business and enter as much as we can. So it's always that balance of are we're getting paid to take some of the risks that you need to take to improve your returns. So we could easily increase our yield or our investment income by moving out the credit curve or moving down our credit or out the yield curve a bit. But to us, our judgment is that, that's not the best way to reach our long-term goals of boosting our total return. We're very mindful of the fact that even for a small increase in rates, whether it's treasury rates or the spreads on non-treasury products, at the current low yield levels, that will produce a negative total return pretty quickly. So we constantly evaluate it, but our philosophy, our goals always stay the same. What Glenn, I think, was referring to earlier, is that the environment changes, and I think we all know now the environment's pretty tough with very, very, very low yields. But if that environment changes and there were more opportunities for us, we would take a bit more risk. Our duration is at the short end of the range, and it's been there for a while, again, to protect capital and not to take much interest rate risk. And our credit quality is high and we feel good about how we're positioned and I'd love it if rates were higher and then we'd sell more opportunities. But that's not the case. So we're not going to stretch and try to hit some artificial yield, low yield, or some number.","Brian C. Domeck","And Paul, this is Brian. On the second half of your question, no, I don't think changes in accounting would change our strategy at all. Bill mentioned our objective function is on a total return basis, that's not going to change. The fluctuations in the equity markets, they're already reflected in comprehensive income, which are in the income statement. And we had previously recorded our comprehensive income well before the change this year, have it more reflected on the income statement. And yes, if it all flows through the income statement, it will create a little bit more volatility in earnings per share, absolutely. But on a comprehensive income basis, which we think is a better measure of all in, there's no change.","Operator","Our next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Glenn, in past Investor Days, you've talked about different customer segments that have different retention tendencies. And I was wondering if you could talk about how the different segments' retention rates were impacted by the rate increases you took in the middle of last year.","Glenn M. Renwick","Sure. I can do that. I'm not going to do it with great specificity because that might be something others want to know as well. But unfortunately, it probably was across all what we call our CMPs, don't worry about it, just call it customer segments. And to the extent that if there was any slight bias, it would be towards the upper end of the client that we actually would like the most and the ones that stay the longest. So again, it's a bias that they're in the data, it's not sort of a jumping-off-cliff kind of concern. But our more preferred customers, clearly, are showing that they don't like the rate volatility. I don't think anyone likes rate volatility. But sort of across the spectrum where there's slight bias towards the preferreds. I would also tell you, just to sort of at least give a nice piece of good news there, I remarked on demand and relative comfort with demand as we see it through the first 2 months of this year, and I'm doing that relative to prior years for the first 2 months, because this is a high period, anyway. We're actually seeing a slight skew to more preferred shoppers in our Direct channel as well. We also put out, and I commented on this, mobile applications -- we've really quite enriched our mobile applications. And while putting 3 by 3[ph], which is 3 vehicles, 3-driver capability on mobile, it's also given a notable shift towards -- it's not huge numbers, but a notable shift towards more preferred customers quoting on mobile devices, which is great. On a personal note, it would be very hard for me to do a 3 by 3 on my phone, but that's probably more eyesight-related than anything else. But it's very clear that people -- and we are getting now a absolutely meaningful percent of our shopping coming in from mobile devices, whether it be iPad, iPhone or Android devices.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And when you talked in the letter and earlier during this call about the free trial falling short, was that just in the number of people that wanted to use the free trial? Or was it different steps in the process to conversion that also did not meet expectations?","Glenn M. Renwick","No, mostly, the top of the funnel. And it's worth repeating because this is sort of important because we're going to take another shot at this. Really, the top of the funnel, and that's why I said maybe our shortfall was really on making this real for other people, like compelling enough reason for me to go out of my way to try it. Insurance isn't necessarily the most engaging topic, period. So for people that actually engage in an insurance-related activity when they're not really highly motivated to do so, that puts a fair onus on us to make the move. But of those that came through the funnel, and we did have, probably, already estimates how many would actually install the device. Remarkably, people do take this and then, never actually install the device -- and that's important, than complete the full trial period, then, actually get a quote after the fact. We had estimates of all those things, obviously, when it's brand new, you have nothing but an estimate. But in many cases, we were very close. In some cases we were able to show that we were conservative. And in others, a couple under. But in aggregate, pretty nice. So we're not worried too much about once you're in the funnel, the kind of dilution effect that gets you down to the point of taking your quote and ultimately, realizing a discount. The funnel looks good. Now we just need to fill the funnel at the top with a lot more consumer demand, and that's going to be tricky. It's just not something that is buying a Coke, it's very different. We're going to have to make it very compelling for people.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I have 2 questions, one very short term and one very long term. On the short term, at the risk of sounding foolish, January was, as far as I can tell, the first January where you lost customers. Can you quantify whether the ad spend was high in January or low, the degree in which the tide had -- receded over the rate filings? And just making such a leap, if January is the wrong month, let's look at February and forward.","Glenn M. Renwick","Advertising in January was -- it turned out the actual amount spent was a little less than the January last year. But that is more an actual versus sort of budget versus a plan to do something. There's probably some media purchasing that would've happened prior to that, so don't read too much into that. We're back roughly at the spend levels of the prior January and our realization of interest, I think, I've already said, is pretty strong and you can take that through January, and even stronger into February. But let's not talk too much about February at this point. Results will be out in some couple of weeks. So it's mostly -- you're right, PIF's falling in January, no one's happy about that. But that is really just the same story that we've had several times in this call. You've got the rate revisions coming through, you've got people renewing into it. And for the most part, we're now through that cycle. That will be the biggest reason. Brian, anything else to add on that?","Brian C. Domeck","Yes, advertising, as we've mentioned before, we ramped up to higher levels starting in January, ended up, to me, spending a little bit less than last January. But still, at pretty high levels. And more into conversion, conversion influenced a depressed new business production and a little bit on the retention side.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And on the very long term, if 5 years ago, you would ask me how much of the market would be net driven, I would think it would be very high. Today, GEICO's probably about 8%, you're about 4%. I assume the whole industry is less than 20%. That kind of surprises me in retrospect. Is the market getting saturated? Why are -- is there a higher percentage of traffic for buying auto insurance going through the Internet right now?","Glenn M. Renwick","Probably a fair question. I don't know that we view it quite the same way. Of our Direct book of business, an extraordinarily high percentage is Internet. So your numbers -- I know where you're coming from on those, but we are probably very oriented to having our customers deal with us online. We believe that's a sweet spot for us, external reviews of websites and so on and so forth, believe that's the sweet spot for us. So of that Direct business, and you know the mix there and you see the vectors have changed over time and certainly, they're a little less dramatic now than they were when you introduce something. But call it 55, 45, a little in the favor of the agency channels, a split that works. So even if you say 50\/50, what you probably should take away for, you say short term and long term, consumer behavior has switched pretty dramatically in a fairly short period of time, but you might conclude that it's stabilizing in terms of how they want to buy, with an intermediary or without an intermediary. You might conclude that. I don't think there's any need for us to conclude anything. We just want to make the options available and be able to be pricing different between the channels. But of the Direct channel, a very significant percentage is Internet-driven for us. So you can sort of do your own math on that 50% in significant percentage. And I also just alluded to the fact that mobile devices are a nontrivial, I should give you some indication, let's say, more than 15% but not 25% of our Direct business. So that's a pretty big chunk. And of the people that shop or quote on their mobile device, about 60% of those are actually, then, consummating the buy on the mobile device. The remainder, it's phone or they go to the Internet. And of that percentage, actually, it skews a little bit more to the pick up the phone. So you've got some really interesting behaviors, and I think it's probably a little too simple of a segmentation now to say it's Internet or intermediated. The Internet can be a combination of a lot of different things. We actually have people start on the phone and finish on the Internet; start on the Internet, finish on the phones; start on a mobile device, finish on the phone. And lots of different combinations. But frankly, we are largely orienting ourselves to be indifferent but highly, highly attractive for people who want to use some form of technology to get their insurance quote and sale. I don't think long term, when you say long term 5 years, you go out even further. It's hard for me to imagine, even in the agency world that, that is not the trend that will dominate.","Brian C. Domeck","And I think agents themselves are also figuring out how to use the Internet to build their own business. So it's not just oh, it's only the Direct channel that's using the Internet to market to customers. So whether it's the shift to the Direct channel per se, I'm still pretty confident that lots of shopping will occur in the Direct channel, but the agents as well are using the Internet to their advantage and we try to help support them in that regard.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, and I guess, I mean, maybe it's the same answer, but is there any reason for me to believe that Direct net sales are being saturated?","Glenn M. Renwick","I don't think so.","Operator","Our next question is from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","My first question is on the January results. I think historically in January, we tend to see a trend where there's very high favorable development and a very high accident year. And I think the interplay with that, as I recall, is December claims that settle in January get recorded as development. This January, we saw a little bit the opposite, you actually had some adverse development in a very favorable accident year compared to historic January. So I guess, I'm wondering, one is -- are those 2 related. Is somewhat the better underlying accident year in January related to the lack of favorable development? And I guess, the second part is, sort of, why didn't we see the traditional favorable development from December?","Glenn M. Renwick","That's a good observation. Brian, you want to?","Brian C. Domeck","Yes, I'll make some comments and then, Gary, feel free to chime in if you like. You're right, in the past several years, we have seen a fairly significant amount of favorable development, particularly in 2010 and '11, less so, actually, in 2012, and partly because we actually changed some of our reserving methodology. Because we saw all the favorable development in past years, so we actually changed how we set some of our reserves for each of the months, et cetera. So we intentionally tried to improve our loss reserving methodology to avoid large swings of favorable development from previous years. So think of it, we set current reserves for each of the months and so in terms of the aging of the inventories. So some of it was process change, intentional process change. And then, secondly, for just to comment on this January, which is where we saw some unfavorable development for the month, about $11 million, about $4 million or so of it was in Commercial Auto, which is an area where we actually had unfavorable development throughout most of last year. So a slight continuation of that in the Commercial Auto side. And some of it, on the bodily injury side, a little bit of a higher reopen rate on bodily injury. But I wouldn't wait a lot on just the 1 month development. But certainly, trying to avoid the large favorable development that we had in the 2010, 2011 timeframe, we actually changed processes to try to improve that. Gary, feel free to add any other comments.","Gary Traicoff","Yes, I think Brian gave a nice summary. We've changed our process in terms of how we're setting our aging factors, more closely try to align on a monthly basis. So it's a little hard to compare to the prior years. And then, as Brian pointed out, within January there was a couple areas that were -- came in a little bit higher, not by much, Commercial Auto $4 million, and a little bit more of reopened activity on the BI.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Got it, that's very helpful, actually. And my other one is a bit more whimsical, Glenn, but I'm just wondering, any thoughts -- I know this isn't a near-term issue, but I'm guessing if anyone studied it, it will be you guys. Any thoughts on what the Google car or driverless cars means long term for the auto insurance industry? I mean, I know it's not a tomorrow thing, but if 10 years from now it's a high penetration of total cars on the road, is that a bad thing for the auto insurance industry?","Glenn M. Renwick","Well, we don't take that as a whimsical thing at all. We actually have a great deal of focus on those things, and excuse me if I don't say everything that we think we know. It is critically important. Ultimately, the size of this industry depends on, sort of, really good estimates of future frequency, to some extent, severity, which is harder to do. So we are very, very active in tracking almost all elements of automotive and road safety that can affect frequency. And in fact, maybe, I'll regret saying this, in our upcoming Investor Relations meeting, I think we'll give you some insight as to how we think about those problems. We probably will not give you any conclusions relative to significant future breakthroughs, including autonomous cars and then, the like. We are actively involved with not only universities but OEMs and other subject matter experts. We take forecasting -- future forecasting very seriously and actually, have some very strong positions on that. I would tell you that while I believe the 50-year trend of reduced frequency in auto accidents, which is from a societal point of view, a great thing, will continue. I don't think that takes much of a brave person to say that. The real issue is with the slope of the line, are there any discontinuities? The autonomous car will emerge a lot faster than it will see population on the roadways. The technology to do an autonomous car has been around for a while, we're now seeing them, we'll see a lot of talk about them. The real issue is exactly how they are able to be part of the fleet of vehicles on the road in America and that is probably not something that need keep anyone awake for quite some time. We'll take you through a little bit of our methodology and thinking on how we actually do things that are a little bit more tangible and give you a look at some things that we've done in the past and then, I think, we'll give you some insight into our methodology and thinking and you can well consider that the autonomous car or even approaching connected vehicles, connected intersections those sorts of things, you can assume that we are looking at them, we may not be as forthright with all of our predictions.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","I guess my instinct is, if you're willing to address it is, in the sort of immediate term, when it's a small part of the population, it's probably a benefit from the better frequency. But if it ever got to a tipping point where it was a large part of the cars on the road it's probably a negative, just because it destroys so much demand because frequency would fall off a cliff. Is that the right way to think about it generally?","Glenn M. Renwick","I think that's a very fair scenario. And I say scenario because it takes a lot to sort of have enough of that tipping point so that the population of vehicles all behave in a controlled manner. But also understand, there will be a level of threat and issue that, frankly, boggles your mind. Very few networks, very few connectivities work 100% of the time. And what does that really mean? What does it mean in terms of liability? Who has liability? What does it mean in other potential issues for insurability? There are elements of that model that might create opportunities for insurers and certainly, there are opportunities for big data sets. So I would say to you, yes, but you might be surprised when you add the complexities of what that means, including even the network reliability, it has all sorts of tangential issues.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","As user-based technology gets rolled out to more -- more and more insurers use it, but longer term, does that have the potential to depress pricing in the better drivers and ultimately, depress margins for that segment?","Glenn M. Renwick","I think if we sort of start with the premise that the entire -- if one company had the entire book of business, the net premium wouldn't change. But the distribution of premium between sort of the better drivers and the less very good drivers might very well change. The whole fundamental concept of segmentation. So you could very much assume that those who are pure premium or real premium, let's just call it their real best estimate of what they should be paying, yes, should go down. I think we have more than enough evidence to suggest there are people on the road today that are paying a little bit because they're indistinguishable from other people like them that deserve a lower rate. So margins go down, percentage-wise for us, it wouldn't change. Absolute value, yes, it would change. And that delta would get pushed to people who are higher consumers of lost costs and better assign the premiums to those individuals. But unless there was some overlay factor that reduced losses in general, I wouldn't assume that the market changes a great deal at all, it's a reallocation of the cost. Take that onto a competitive marketplace and you can apply the competitive dynamics of knowing the information before your competitors and so on and so forth, something that obviously, we're very intrigued by.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Right, right. So -- but that would assume, then, the heavier users of lost cost will have to pay more for insurance down the road to compensate for the better drivers paying less for insurance. Is that right?","Glenn M. Renwick","That's fair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And another question. Just sort of a numbers question. Looking at cash flow from operations at the parent. In the last 2 years, it's come down from roughly $1.1 billion to $670 million. I guess, why is that, and should we expect that to reverse going forward?","Glenn M. Renwick","Brian, you want to take that? Give us a second to catch up with your specifics.","Brian C. Domeck","Are you talking about from the cash flows, from the consolidated statement of cash flows? From the parent? Well, the primary driver of cash flows is some of the underwriting profit. And so underwriting profit, obviously, the margin was a little bit less than 2012. I would say that's the primary driver of it. It's just sort of -- the underwriting profit is the primary driver. So if -- as margins change, that would be the primary influencing of it.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then one more, just a quick detail question. When I look at the reserves, it looked like you had a prior year favorable development of $85 million for the 2012 calendar year. In general, is that coming from more recent or older accident years?","Glenn M. Renwick","We'll let Gary comment on that.","Gary Traicoff","This is Gary Traicoff. That's coming from mostly older accident years. 2011, we developed unfavorably, and that was mostly on the Auto BI, as the severity cost increased. As we've talked about from the older years, we had favorable development. And we've adjusted our factors by aging to try to get a more equal distribution going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from John Hall with Wells Fargo.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Glenn, you take a lot of organizational pride in your customer experience in the claims process. And I guess, Storm Sandy is the largest event that we've seen since you've been distributing homeowners through the Progressive channel as it were. Just wondering if you could offer us some sort of a report card or maybe, some observations that you could take away for from the performance of your homeowners partners from that event.","Glenn M. Renwick","Thank you for the first comment, because you're right and we don't do it just as a nicety. It's really very genuine. And your question is a great one, I'm not going to be able to give you as good an answer as you might like. Feel free to ask me again on that. The reason I'm saying that is we're doing that study right now. We do know that our NPS scores dropped as it related to our PHA experience. And I guess, we shouldn't be overly shocked about that because of the nature of people sustaining a significant loss. What we need to know is, was that drop somewhat consistent with overall themes, was it specific to us. And I mean it, please feel free to ask me again, but we're doing that exact question for ourselves to assess a little scorecard on our partners and how they manage through a specific event. We have had other events and we have had post-action reviews on those events. And our early indications would tell us, notwithstanding the NPS scores not heading in the direction that, obviously, we'd like, or staying stable. We would add -- the earliest takeaway is that, in general, our partners performed very well.","Operator","Thank you. And that was our final question.

","It's my pleasure to introduce to you our CEO, Tricia Griffith.","Susan Griffith","Good afternoon, and welcome to Progressive Second Quarter Webcast. We are thrilled to be able to talk to you about the investments we've been making for and on behalf of our customers and our customer relationship management group. If you read my letter to shareholders, I outlined several other investments that we're making on behalf of our customer on the claim side. ","We've been talking about for a couple of years, and we are excited to tell you that a lot of the things that we had in place were come to fruition, and we're really pleased with how they're coming along. But before we get to that, I have to mention an accomplishment that has been over 10 years in the making, and that is getting our #3 ranking in the private passenger auto back. ","It's been a lot of hard work, and we're really excited and thrilled to be able to celebrate this accomplishment. And of course, it leads us to get even closer to our ultimate vision of becoming consumer's #1 choice. So we're really proud of that accomplishment, and I want to take just a moment to thank the over 36,000 Progressive people for their hard work, their dedication and their commitment to our core values. I want to thank our shareholders for their confidence in us. And ultimately, I want to thank our customers that were so privilege and honor to serve. ","So let me set up the day. You will have seen in this construct before, this is the third time we've talked about it. This is what we call our 4 cornerstones. Our core values, who we are; our purpose, why we're here. Our purpose statement is true to our name progressive; our vision, where we're headed, I just talked about that becoming consumer's #1 choice and destination for auto and other insurance; and our strategy, how we're going to get there. We focused a lot on the strategy because that's really kind of the meat of how we will achieve our mission. We have 4-strategy pillars. ","Today, we're going to hit on 2 of them. The first line is meeting the broader needs of our customers throughout their lifetime. We want to be available, where, when and how customers want to shop and be served. You're going to hear a lot about that today, because really not about us saying, here is what we're giving to give and customers you kind of figure out how to work with us, we really follow the customer. We'll continue to evolve, as technology involves and customer's needs evolve. The other pillar we're going to talk about is maintaining a leading brand, specifically experiences that instill confidence. ","When the customer calls to add a policy, add a coverage, have a claim, at the end of that experience, we want them to say, I'm so confident, I made the right choice when I chose Progressive. That is so critical to us. And so those 2 wearily be on the footprint of what we're talking about today. I'm going to have two of my direct reports in tagteam this deep dive session into our customer relationship management our focus. ","John Murphy, you haven't met in before, but he has been around for Progressive for over 25 years. The majority of his career was spending claims, and I've known for decades. He lived around the country in many high-level leadership positions and ultimately, before becoming the President of CRM, ran our customer service centers. ","When I met John and have watched his career along the way, what I really noticed about him is his passion for the customer, and his ability to always kind of see what we needed to do to continue to innovate and be more creative. And he has done just that in CRM. He has been in CRM as a President for 3 years, and I'm really thrilled to be able to have him highlight what he has been working on. ","He will tag team with our Chief Information Officer, Steven Broz. You've met Steven before in this setting. Steve grew up in the Product Group, ultimately going into GM of our personal lines. He has also been in IT as a project Manager and claims is a process Manager, and now he his leading ID for the last couple of years. ","You might ask why I have these 2 together. It really is about establishing how we work at Progressive in terms of the business and IT, and we're really handing together. When we think about investments, especially with the customer. And you'll see how when they speak, we just -- we all the things that are about our business, and we don't separate that. In fact, we often recall the technology company that happened to sell insurance, and you will see that technology the underpinning, but it's not separate. It is together, and that's the thing what makes our whole team really powerful that we look at everything together to make sure that we continue to profitably grow. I hope you enjoy reading in the shareholders letter. We're very proud of our results for this quarter and actually year-to-date and more proud of the momentum we have and the excitement about the opportunities that lie ahead office. ","So with that, John Murphy come up and join me and talk about what he has been working on, the results of that and just going forward how we think about our customers.","John Murphy","Great. Thank you, Tricia, and good afternoon, everyone. Over the past 3 years, we've been on a very deliberate journey to customer centricity. No longer just auto an insurance company, but instead a customer company that really specializes in insurance products and services to meet customers needs where as they long as they have them. ","To fuel ongoing sustained and now accelerating growth, we've may retaining our existing customers as large a priority as acquiring new ones. And that business mandate is really the catalyst for the changes that Steve and I are going to discuss today. So we're going to start with some foundational adjustments that are attended to position us really well near- and long-term for success. And then we will refresh you on our preferred measure of retention, policy life expectancy as well as how we think about it and approach it. We'll spend much of our time on the technology-related investments that we've made for or on behalf of our customers, going across the lifecycle, while also giving you some insights into how we choose what we're going to invest in. And then finally, we're going to share how customers are rewarding us for the improvements that we delivered. And I think, you will see that the return on these investments has been really substantial.","Now historically speaking, sustained improvements in retention have been elusive for us as they have been for many others. Knowing that we wanted to see both significant and sustainable progress going forward, we felt it necessary to make some foundational adjustments to position us to deliver in that matter. ","Now this list that you will see here is far from comprehensive, but we want to give you just review into few meaningful changes that we've made. We're going to start with our company-wide mission. So we've long had this objective to become #1. Our excellence in marketing and new business acquisition practices have really allowed us to appeal to large segments of consumers and increase market share. ","Previously, our company-wide mission to become consumer's #1 choice for auto insurance. And this is how we've evolved. To become consumer's #1 choice and destination for auto and other insurance, this current statement really reflects the understanding that in order to become a destination insurer, we must have the products and the services to meet customers needs as they move across the insurance journey. We must go beyond new business, where we've been best-in-class for many years and deliver a more compelling comprehensive customer value proposition that really allows us to become the true destination insurer. And so to this end, we made some major changes to our business, products and services. ","So as you know we've made the purchase of ASI, an acquisition that we have been extremely pleased with and we've rebranded at Progressive home. With Progressive home, we have broad geographic coverage in both the agency and direct channels and are position to offer the sophisticated rate segmentation that is really been the hallmark of our auto product for coverage that protects our customers most valuable asset. This acquisition has been instrumental to our substantial Robinson growth and the mix shift that we're going to talk about later in this presentation. ","Now of course, to fulfill this destination vision, we needed to offer a breadth of products so customers didn't need to look elsewhere. So we expanded our product to include many products that were in demand, meet the most broader needs of our customers and ultimately extend policy life. We refer to these as our advantage products, and sales are on the climb. In fact, they are up more than 40% relative to this time last year.","Now we know customers have higher expectations of brands that they engage with frequently. They expect an easy experience, one that really recognizes who they are, respects their time and makes recommendations that are right for them. So we enhanced our service offerings to deliver what's important to both our current and our future customers, inspiring trust and instilling confidence that they chose the right insurer. As we stand here today, we believe firmly that we can now meet customers' needs throughout their lifetimes. ","So our vision and the tactics to broaden our vision, we're an important first step. But what the vision changes came and need to really look within to assess our organizational structure and ask ourselves whether or not we were set up to achieve this vision. Historically, customer relationship management organization was the operations arm of Personal Lines and thus heavily focused on new business acquisition. But in order to create parity among consumers and customers and to position CRM to serve as an advocate for our customers, our organization became a standalone business unit, now also reporting to pressure. ","And by adding experience design responsibilities to our traditional delivery role, we can really embrace the and CRM and focus our time on starting, deepening and extending many more customer relationships. This customer focus leadership has allowed us to really challenge traditional beliefs to generate healthy debates and ultimately to create better solutions for customers who trust us to meet our needs not only our purchase, but throughout the ownership experience.","So with the new organizing principle and sponsorship of customer first conversations among our entire senior team, it became clear that we have to have a single definition of the ideal customer experience. So next I'm going to talk about this unifying experience -- effort that we referred to internally as our target customer experience.","Now the functional nature and alignment of our business groups has really allowed us to optimize the experience within our individual areas. But as a result, the experience is not been quite as cohesive as we moved across the life cycle. So to generate much greater consistency, we created a single vision for how we take care of customers. Our target customer experience provides an end-to-end view, and it goes across the brand by service and claims functions, while applying to all channels contains a common definition and experience Northstar for our collective design teams to pursue. ","This was drafted by senior leaders representing each business function. It has really strong buying as a result, and it serves to inform our technology investment strategy. In just a few minutes, Steve is going to talk about some of the specific investments that we've made with this is our guide and with the intent of delivering easy, personal and caring experiences. ","So now with an expanded view -- I'm sorry, with expanded vision, new organizational structure and shared experience strategy, the final piece for us was really to expand our capabilities. So these are functional processes and people-related investments that were intended to create a customer-centric environment, where we can really excel for the customers that we are so privileged to serve. We created a customer experience design organization to really lead these efforts. We had a digital expertise to enable self service and allow our customers to engage when, where and how they choose. ","We invested in data science and predictive modeling to guide interaction frequency and content, and we enhanced our voice of customer platform, providing real-time and robust insights to inform our hypothesis. We applied the testing approach in rigor that has been so effective for us in acquisition to the servicing experience. And with the development of research and testing lab, we are able to quickly understand the effectiveness of personalized treatments. We found opportunities to leverage newly imported skills to build applications that capitalized on these learnings quickly. Examples that you heard about in the past, include chai or homegrown chat capability, which really leverages our artificial intelligence and the customer relationship assistant, which allows a contextually relevant and personal experiences going across engagement channels. ","And we've grown our in-house agency. We refer to that as a Progressive Advantage Agency, not as to expand our multiproduct service offering. And by integrating the ASI insurance operations, we are going to be able to deliver a truly bundle experience for the Robinsons. ","So to this point, you've heard about a handful of foundational adjustments that we've made to really position us for success. We enhanced our vision to reflect our ultimate destination and expanded our product suite to meet the broader needs of our customers. We adjusted our organizational design to elevate the importance of the customer relationship taken an end-to-end view to ensure both consistency and across the journey, and we've added capabilities that provide deep insights, analytics and testing to enhance our experience delivery efforts. ","And we've made a lot of progress during these past few years, which for a company of our size and scale is markedly fast. As you come to expect from Progressive, we make a commitment to something, we execute and we make it happen. Now with solid operating plan is critical to increasing retention, but there is this cultural element that we're driving hereto. Operational excellence supply to discrete transactions are not just really key moments in successful long-term relationships, and we are seeking a really, really long lasting relationships. In fact, we're pursuing relationships lasting for decades. We've moved beyond individual policies and now think about households, the relationship that we formed and that was that's been in placed in us to protect our customers most valuable assets. This cultural shift that we're driving is really built on a foundation of our core values, integrity, always doing the right thing, golden rule, treating people the way they want to be treated and excellence, and never ending pursuit of constant continuous improvement. This encourages our folks to stop and ask, am I solidifying this relationship? And am I performing in a manner that will generate a relationship that's going to last a really long time, in fact, even decades? As a company who reviews data and goal setting, we choose to set an aspirational target around this relationships. And since 2015, we've seen a 33% increase in the number of households that have chosen us to stay with us for a decade along. ","Now our decade customer measure is a motivating organizational metric, but the true KPI for our customer retention efforts is policy life expectancy. So I'm going to refresh you on the measurement and talk about how we approach driving it. So policy life expectancy is really the average length of time and new customer states with us. PLA describes our retention efforts in one number, taking into account mix and tenure. Let me remind you of the calculation. On this graph, the blue bar shows retention results by month. Each point, on the orange line, reflects the past 12 months and then we calculate that area under the curve, the result is the average time that we expect the new customer to stay. ","Now you've heard us refer to PLE in the past is our holy and in the Destination Era, this is truly our currency. So to improve PLE, our strategy leverages the 3 major drivers of retention, and we pursue process and systems improvements to try and change the shape of this curve. The 3 major drivers of nature, nurture and price. Think of nature is the mix of our customer segments. We talked about the Sams, Dianes, Wrights and Robinsons in prior meanings, and they have very different PLEs. ","So we are able to positively shift overall PLE by significantly growing the longest retaining segment, which for us is the Robinsons. Now nurture is about the experience we deliver. Through advancements here, we can give customers reasons to stay with Progressive longer and thus create even greater value. ","Now for many price or product competitiveness is the reason they choose a company, choose to shop or choose to stay. On our last call, we talked about the gains that we've made in operating efficiency that we use to generate a pricing advantage. Next quarter personalized President, Pat Callahan is conduct about segmentation. So for today, we're going to focus our comments on nature and nurture. ","So again nature is the mix of customers. And the graph on the left shows policies in force growth by segment of the past 5 years. The broadening of our product suite and the distribution of those products through multiple initiatives, including platinum, our enhanced independent agent program, HomeQuote Explorer or online HomeQuote aggregator and the Full-service Progressive Advantage Agency have helped us grow all segments, while the Robinsons segment in particular is growing the fastest and has been accelerating. ","On the right side of the page, you will find the PLE relativity is by segment and considering that the Robinsons have a much longer PLE, our efforts to shift mix are both really worthwhile and also really paying off. ","Now nurture is the experience we deliver. And when we design experiences, we do so from the customer point of view, considering the 3 notions they tell us they value, easy, personnel and carrying. Insurance can be complicated, as you know. So execution for our customers just can't be. So we develop processes and tools to enable self-service, while also educating or outstanding customer care consultants to operate in an advisory capacity when customers look for guidance. Easy to understand and easy to execute, that's where we start. And we know that individual wants and needs can significantly. And many large organizations really struggle to move beyond a single experience overall. But for us by using internal and external data, leveraging our systems and predictive models, we're able to really know our customers so that we can personalize it scale. And then caring comes down to our people, our culture, our values and our overwhelming desire to fulfill the promises that we make to be here when our customers need us and to always do the right thing. When we deliver on these 3 things, we're able to instill confidence and trust and ultimately extend customer relationships. ","Now the graph on the right shows the contribution that our nurture experience improvements have made to lifetime earned premium over the past several quarters. We didn't measure this prior to 2016, but we're able to now. And relative to that first quarter in 2016, we've increased our contribution 18 fold. Now we know our experience contribution because we conduct controlled experiments that allow us to measure our specific impact. So before Steve talks about the investments we've made to generate retention improvements, let's spend some time talking about how we measure the impact of these nurture enhancements and decide ultimately what we'll invest in. ","Hypotheses are informed by extensive research, voice of customer insights and our business experiences. Taking a page from our acquisition playbook, we conduct rigorous calls testing using an AB framework, which allows us to then validate, which process changes, tools or treatments are truly valued by our customers. Now those resulting in a behavioral change are the things we choose to invest in. This combination of art and science is how we make decisions. Customers tell us where they want to go. We test, validate and then go there. ","So now I'd like to invite Steve up to talk about some of the technology investments that we've made to really help drive the experience. Steve?","Steven Broz","Thank you, John. Good afternoon. Let's kick off our discussion here with the Slide that John shared a few minutes ago. Becoming a destination insurer for our customers requires an investment in product breadth. Adding products to our portfolio allows us to meet the broader needs of our customers over their lifetime. And if you look at the PLE data on the right here, it's clear that no product is more important to add than homeowner sending. It increases auto PLE more than any other additional products we sell. ","Going back to the graph on the left, John rightly pointed out how much Robinsons have grown. I just want to add another piece of here which Diane's on the Wrights are the largest customer segments in terms of policies in force and seeing growth there is important too, because they are the Robinsons of the future. We've been talking about Robinsons a lot, so let's talk about where Robinsons come from. ","Some Robinsons are is a fully bundled customer. They bundle their home and their auto from the moment they join Progressive. For these customers, it's really important that we're really good at marketing to prospective customers and consumers. Many Robinsons come through graduation. They start at Progressive with either auto policy or their home policy. And as their needs evolve overtime, they have the other policy along the way. ","No matter how they get there, we call all of the groups Robinsons. And to be clear, the second line on this diagram is the largest source of Robinsons for us. Those who first buy their auto policy with Progressive and later by their homes, and this means that marketing to current customers is every bit is important as marketing to potential customers. ","Whether you're current customer or potential customer, we believe you should be able to buy homeowner insurance the way you wish. Just like we do an auto insurance, we offer home insurance through the independent agent channel, online at progressive.com or on the phones at 1-800-Progressive. We'll cover each of these channels separately. But before we do that, let's take a step back and look at the homeowners and auto insurance industry as a whole. ","What you see here our 2017's private passenger auto and homeowners insurance premiums segmented by channel and by customer segment. One opportunity really stands out for us. I would say more than half of the total premium is Robinsons. This is another reason why homeowners insurance is such an important piece of the product portfolio. ","Furthermore, more than half of that premium is in the captive agent channel, an agent that -- channel we don't do business in. So our goal is to move that premium to the right. We believe independent agents are well positioned to compete with captive agents for this market. After all, their local just like captives, and we would argue that the offer a better customer value proposition. ","Captive agents represent one company, and our independent agents represent multiple companies, truly looking across their companies for the right combination of coverage and price for their customers. ","We think direct can take share from the captives as well. Specially, as digital natives come of age and begin purchasing their first cars and their first homes, and be honest a homeowner's insurance product is long been dominated by agents, and as that product adapts to perform better in the direct channel, we think the direct channel will grow significantly here as well. ","John talked about the customer journey and investments we have made all along the way. We won't touch much on brand today to learn more about that, you can look back at our fourth quarter 2017, investor event or talked about branding at great length.","But let's start talking about buying specifically, buying homeowners insurance so that we change the mix of our customers to those customers that retain longest. Both channels are important, but let's start with direct. If you look at industry premiums, we can see that across the industry, direct, the direct carriers have a much lower share in homeowners than they do in auto insurance. In the long run, we believe these numbers will converge. And it's not because private passenger autos are going to go down, because homeowners insurance is become more direct. ","We look forward to leading the industry in this change and taking more than our fair share of that growth. One of the key investments we've made to increase and direct homeowners sales is HomeQuote Explorer, or HQX. It launched in March 2017, and its goal is to really make shopping and buying homeowners insurance online intuitive and simple. ","Some of the ways that those are shown here. In the top box, it says info we found, and that just highlights in order to make the quote easier and faster for our customers, we some data. We don't that data to be secret from our customers, so we give an opportunity to see what we found and to verify its accuracy. And below that you can see sections on wall construction and roof type. And here we try to use clear visuals and concise language to help customers through some questions that can be a little tricky for them. The more we keep them engage with the quote, the more they can answer the questions they need to, to move through this quote the more successful this funnel is for us. ","Finally, we take all that information and we compare rates across multiple carriers to find the right price and the right coverage for our customers. And in true Progressive form, we returned the rates of all the carriers even when Progressive is in the lowest. In this case, you'll see Progressive Home, second from the right, with the second Bottom line for us is we believe no other offering gives customers an option to enter the information just once and so quickly and easily get rates from multiple homeowners carriers. And the impact it's had on our ongoing home of the sales has been dramatic. We've seen big increases since HQX and elevated in the first quarter 2017. Our strong branding has made us -- long made us the leader in online homeowners quotes and HQX simply made that sales funnel much more efficient. We all believe this is a fantastic return on our investment. ","HQX is also given us a nice feature to promoting our ads. The 2 TV ads that are featured HQX have been year-to-date, and they both done a nice job driving new auto and home sales. We think there is room for improvement here. We have a couple of carriers, who had a buy button on HQX, which allows the customer to buy the policy online and with carriers add that functionality, we see an increase in sales of about 10%. We're thrilled to say that Progressive Home added it's first buy and its first date in May. We're excited to bring that option to customers to be able to buy Progressive Home policy online and thrilled to add the direct capability to Progressive Home, formerly ASI and continue to extract value from that acquisition.","Some customers, as I said earlier, they want to buy the home and auto at the same time. And for them, we have multiproduct It's exactly what it sounds like. You can quote your home and your auto in one seamless quote and buy them both too. In this case, it's important to note that our home quote here is connected to HQX. So these guys the same HomeQuote taking experience that we just reviewed. ","The results here have been fantastic too. It's another investment that's produced great returns for us. We've seen multiproduct coding, homeowners sales increased dramatically in the last 2 years. And finally in the direct channel, we'll talk about the option for customers, who want to call. They might call because they want to start a quote or they might call to finish a quote that they started online. In any case, when they call, they end of contacting people in our in-house agency, the Progressive Advantage Agency. ","And the results here are truly amazing. And the truth is that for most people insuring their home is insuring their most valuable asset. And they get some confidence from talking to a real person and knowing that someone understands their needs and has taken the time to match their needs to the right carrier, right coverage and the right price. ","Technology is certainly help this growth. If you look at this inflection point in 2017, that's when we turned on HQX and improved the sales funnel dramatically through technology. But with that being said, none of this would be possible without the great work that John and his team has done. They started this team from scratch. They it up overtime and scaled it up as well, and these results couldn't happen without their great work. ","Now that we cover direct, let's switch to independent agents and talk about our results there. You can see in the independent agent channel, the Robinson sales and have grown at a very healthy rate. Unit sales up more than 6x in the last 2 years, policies in force have nearly tripled for Robinsons and the independent agent channel. ","One of the key drivers, and John mentioned this earlier, is the product -- is the broad geographic distribution of our Progressive Home product. You can see in 2013, Progressive Home was in about 24 states and was called ASI then, of course. And in 2018, Progressive Home, we're happy to say, is in 45 states. To be fair, many other things that contributed to the growth of Robinsons and the independent agency channel. For example, agent distribution and the agent compensation. ","We don't have time to cover all of that today, so again I'd encourage you if you would like to learn more to look back at presentation that had today at our third quarter 2017 investor event. We've done well in growing agency Robins, but we believe we can do better. Portfolio quoting the soon and extend our lead in the independent agent channel, where we've long been recognized as a leader and technology and ease of use. Portfolio quoting allows agents to seamlessly quote and bind multiple products, including homeowners and special lines and of course, auto. On this screen, an agent simply selects the products she wishes to quote for the customer and bundle and enter portfolio quote. After working through an integrated a seamless quoting processes, the customer and agent end up here and returns rates for multiple products at once. In this example, you can see there is an auto, home and a motorcycle policy being rated. And the information makes it easy for the agent to highlight savings to the customer, you see those on the top, in the middle and green, the bundled savings and additional offers the agent might want to make for the customer. You see those in the blue on the top right. In this case, it's snapshot of an umbrella policy. We'll elevate portfolio quoting soon, so we don't have actual results to share. ","We do, however, have a feedback from -- that we've collected from agents in our usability lab where they had ability to use portfolio quoting, and their response has been fantastic. So game changer is beautiful and clean, intuitive and easy. We have distanced ourselves from the competition and this last one is my favorite, can you please elevate in my state first. There is an eager want among independent agents, who have seen portfolio quoting in action, and this overwhelming positive agent feedback makes us very optimistic about the impact that technology can have on agency Robinson growth. ","Now that we've talked about direct and independent agency channel, and how Robinsons have grown each of them, let's wrap this discussion up by bringing that story together and talk about how successful we've been in shifting the mix of our customers to those customers who stay the longest to Robinsons. The best summary measure we have is to talk about our mix, our share of the household Robinsons households. And you can see here that over the last few years, our share of Robinsons householdsHQXas more than doubled. And as exciting as that is, growth has accelerated year-over-year. We're thrilled about the progress we have made, but it's fair to say that we're even more excited about the room we have to grow. The homeowners insurance industry has been around for nearly a century and before long it's been around people have been battling home and auto together. We're relatively new to this game, but really jumping in, in the last few years, and we're really excited about the progress we have made. And we're excited about what the future holds as well. ","We've touched on buying and we talked about how bundling home insurance can change the mix of customers and increase policy life expectancy, now it's time to spend some time talking about servicing. I'll start with the comment that John made. He talked about how our shifting from product-centric culture, one that asked the question, who can we sell this product to? To customer-centric culture, but the question becomes, which products to our customers need? To translate this cultural change into action at scale, we think we need 3 key ingredients and the first ingredient is the right data. ","This year, we completed a foundational investment in customer data that we call customer hub. We purchased the solution and integrated with our systems. In the process, we modernized our customer systems and retired decades old homegrown systems. Customer have simply allowed us to know the customer and the household much, much better. ","The second ingredient is a robust product portfolio. So far we focused on homeowners and rightfully so, it is the most important additional product we can sell. But to truly become a destination insurer across the customer lifetime, we have to be able to offer other products as well. And in 2013, we offered just a handful of such products, but by 2018, we tripled the number of additional products we offer. ","This typically extend beyond property-casualty insurance and sometimes beyond insurance is itself. the manufacturing by others and distributed by Progressive. This is in part and often to play a video get paid commission on the sales, but it's also a defensive play. We want customers to think about their Progressive relationship first and have confidence that we can fulfill their needs over their lifetime. This will prevent them from developing relationships with other firms, who I'm sure. We'll gladly take the auto and home premium. So far we have two key ingredients, data from customer hub that allows us to know the household much better and an expanded portfolio of products that increased right product to offer at the right time. ","The last ingredient in determining this cultural change direction and scale is the means to offer these products to customers in the right context. And that's where customer relationship assistant comes in, CRA. When customers contact us for other reasons, CRA helps us make the right offer to the right customer at the right time. The CRM data science team builds a rapid prototype of CRA using machine learning in late 2016. And during 2017, we iterated on that product until we feel confident that we could roll it out to all of our customer care consultants, which we did in early 2018. And since then, we've also started to added to our digital channels. ","Over that time period from late 2016 until now, we've seen the offer rate for just -- rate for just one of our offers. The offer to get home insurance, quote increased by more than 20%. That's a substantial increase when you consider the fact that this is an offer we make, millions of times per year. Take those 3 things together, the right customer knowledge, a rich product portfolio and an intelligent delivery mechanism for those products, and we think we're going to continue to increase the number of products per customer. This should in turn to higher retention.","Now it certainly announces the customer experience to get the right offer at the right time, core customer transactions like paying a bill, changing a vehicle or adding a driver are important too. Our investments here focus on 3 areas, as they always do. They focus on people and process and technology. But today, we're here to talk about technology and the around of technology, we really focused on two things when it comes to core customer transactions. One is mobile and the other is online. ","When it comes to mobile, one of our goals is to make sure that our customers can do everything that on phone that they can do online. You can see we made steady progress towards that goal over the last few years and while there are a few transactions that you can't do on your phone right now, those transactions are in frequent. ","And we'll continue to chip away with this as our priorities indicate is the right thing to do. The other thing we want to do with the mobile devices make sure we take advantage of the capabilities that the device offers. And one of the simple capabilities it has, but powerful as well is its ability to recognize a fingerprint and our faces. ","Customers can use face ID and touch ID to log into the app and also to pay bills through Google Pay or Apple Pay. If I can, I'd like to share a story of my own to show you how powerful this can be. A few months ago, my older son Parker got his driver's license. It was a Friday afternoon, and he texted me, of course, from the DMV with a picture probably portraying him with this new driver's license. I texted him right back and say congratulations, nice job and then I thought, oh my gosh, I need to change his status on the policy from being a permanent driver to driver. The great thing was without putting my phone down, I could do with walking from one meeting to the next, use my thumbprint to log into the app, changes with just 2 types of my fingers and then use my thumbprint to pay the additional premium. That's so easy and that's our goal. We think that during life events like this, any friction we introduce to the transaction increases the likelihood that our customer will shop and potentially live Progressive and making the process this simple and easy for our customers is a great step forward.","We're thrilled about how mobile option is going. When you look at app downloads by our customers, which are quadrupled in the last few years or mobile option as a percentage of which also quadrupled the last few years, we're thrilled about the growth we're seeing in mobile adoption. Even with this being true though in the second quarter of this year, we saw a record number of logins to our online servicing site. ","So online servicing is still really important, and we're reinventing online servicing. But you can see here as a previous expense that we had online, where customer feedback and customer actions that we have observed show that they struggle to navigate through this. Navigation was inconsistent from page to page. It was hard for customers to find the policy that they were looking for. And so we change things around on the right side, I can zoom in for you to see it better, we're reinventing policy servicing. And what you can see here, the visible changes are clear information hierarchy, the interactions and text are much are much clearer and navigation if you could see the next page is consistent throughout the site. We've seen customer feedback from usability testing, it's very positive. They find us new architecture clean and easy to use. As important as these visible changes are, there is some invisible changes that are equally important. Behind the scenes is a customer centric architecture built for the Destination Era and the multi-policy experience. Tasks and content can be prioritized and personalized depending up with a customer, who is visiting the page. And the flexibility that John's team uses to conduct that AB testing is enhanced in this architecture. It means that John's team can conduct those experiments faster and faster, and we can accelerate our learning to improve the customer experience.","The bottom line here is that we look to understand customer needs and solve their problems, and then we find the right delivery mechanism for the solution. Sometimes it's the app, sometimes it's online and sometimes it's both. We expect our investments in mobile and an online servicing to increase retention and increase self-service as well.","Finally, we come to the last leg of the customer journey for some customers and that's claims. This is a moment of truth for our customers and a chance for us to fulfill the promise we've long made to them. Our significant investments in claims technology give our customers enhanced visibility, communication and control during their claim experience. And I can't go into detail because time won't allow me into all the changes we made, but Tricia several paragraphs in our quarterly shareholder's letter to this topic. I encourage you to read it, if you haven't done so already. I'll summarize here by saying that we've added a lot of digital capabilities, you see those on the right, for customers and employees. And then you will see on the left that adoption of these new capabilities has been very fast and continues to grow. Now that we reviewed the technology investments across the customer journey and highlighted the significant returns that they have created. I'd like to invite John backup to wrap things up. John?","John Sauerland","Thank you, Steve. So in summary, to fuel ongoing and sustained growth, we've made retaining our existing customers as large a priority as acquiring new ones. We've made foundational and cultural adjustments to really position us for near- and long-term success. We've shifted our mix to longer retaining customers, while continuing to grow all segments and delivered significant and measurable improvements to the experience, and these improvements go across the customer journey. Now we would not be nearly as successful, but for the really strong partnerships like the ones that Steve and I have and our teams have working toward a common objective. ","So after hearing our story today, we suspect you might be wondering how are we doing? And the answer is exceptionally well. Policy life expectancy is at an all-time high. We've increased at more than 20% in just 3 years, and this increase in retention equates to well more than $10 billion in life time on premium across our entire book of business. And this is not a one-year phenomenon. We made steady progress in 2016 and built on it again in 2017. ","We saw significant and sustained improvements and that is exactly what we've delivered. And while we're proud of the progress we made of the past 3 years, we are far more excited about what the future holds, because we believe firmly that we have just scratched the surface of what's possible. So on behalf on Steve and I, thank you very much for your time today. And now, please give Tricia and John a few moments to set up for the Q&A.","Julia Hornack","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, Andrew, please introduce our first participant from the conference call line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research.","Amit Kumar","Good afternoon, thanks for that great presentation. Two quick questions. The first question goes back to, I guess, with the discussion on HQX and MPQ. It's been a year since HQX came online, and I was sort of broadly thinking of what kind of customer would respond to this product? Now that past, do you think younger, I guess, Sam or Diane is responding more than what you might have anticipated? And now that you have to sit and watch and on into our Robinsons? Or maybe talk about, I guess, the percentage share by the names you have as to how they are responded to this product?","Susan Griffith","I would say rather than thinking about from a demographic, likely wouldn't be the Sam necessarily, Diane graduate, it would be someone is going to become a Robinsons anyway because they have a home. So I think when I think of customers that want to go through the HQX process, it's people that are digitally savvy and they want to make it easy and they want to make sure there is a place where they can go and they understand very clearly with pictures, what kind of rules they have. We can take publicly available data and input. It's really take the customer 20 years ago that started searching for auto online, these direct peoples are no one is going to ever search for auto online, but of course, that happened. Think of that customer, and that's what we think it will grow, because ultimately it's a customer that's just digitally savvy, and they want to do all of their business online.","Amit Kumar","The second question sort of shifting gears, you're talking about growth. Recently last month a number of auto manufacturers in fact, revise their outlook as the impact of tariffs comes in. I was going through some all old transcripts, and if you go back to '08, '09, Glenn and others have talked about the impact of slowing auto sales in terms of margins. What is your view on that impact from here?","Susan Griffith","We're not sure what we with the Obviously, we're watching that closely, and if there is less autos to ensure that affects the industry. However, we have a very small share of that addressable market. So when you think about that $300-plus billion in auto and home, we have 10%. So we believe even if the pie shrinks, it actually grew 8% last year. Even if the prior shrinks, we believe with where we're positioned that we will be able to have a bigger piece of that pie.","Julia Hornack","Thank you. Andrew, can we take the next caller please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James.","Greg Peters ","Going back to HomeQuote Explorer, I was wondering if you could provide some additional current around the number of carriers that are participating in that product? And I know recently there were some news there around curtailing its partnership with Progressive. And I'm wondering if you could take your discussion around HomeQuote Explorer and the number of carriers and also comment on the announcement?","Susan Griffith","Sure, Greg. Currently on HQX, we have four carriers, including Progressive Home. And for we've been working with them for years in our Progressive Advantage Agency and although the news came out this week for us is all news. We've been working with them at a price for over a year now to convert that business and upon nonrenewable be able to give them our rate for Progressive Home and other unaffiliated partners. The majority has gone to Progressive Home, and some to the partners, but we're happy about we continue to do around every month as things and that will continue through 2019. We're really impressed with the retention rate of those customers once they change their business from over to Progressive Home.","Greg Peters","And then another specific question. I found your discussion around mobile adoption quite interesting. And I'm not sure you're going to be willing to give me what percentage of your total customers have adopted a mobile solution for your company. But maybe you could -- and maybe you will answer that, but if you don't, may be you could provide us some color around the split of mobile adoption between the segments, including the Robinsons?","Susan Griffith","We don't really share that, I would say, mobile adoption continues to increase and have probably come out a little bit more on the channels. So on direct channel, obviously that's a customer that wants to go directly as well. So that is a much higher rate of adoption than say our agency channel Although in talking to agents, they're continuing to talk to our customers, our collective customers to get them to do some of these things like Steve talked about on the mobile device. So they really -- if they don't need to call the agent there, they don't have to.","Greg Peters","Just maybe can you give us a sense, is it more auto versus home? Or am I just get nowhere with this?","Susan Griffith","No. No. It is more auto versus our home goal, of course, when John talked about the targeted customer experiences to be able to have everything you have whether it is on Progressive paper or not. Mobile device, we're not there yet we continue to invest. I would say, it's a much higher percentage on auto.","John Sauerland","I think we previously shared that a very large percentage of our direct customers, who quote online are now doing so via the mobile device. So our earliest our adoption of mobile was in quoting and buying as we've added functionality to the mobile app, the uptick there has been really impressive. So we found, as we build it, they will come, if you will, is predominantly been faster in the direct channel, not surprisingly. But increasingly agent customers are picking up on mobile as well. So one clarification I want to make on earlier comments on share for a home and auto, so Steve I think it was $325 billion market place of home and auto today, we're at about 10% share of the auto, think about 1 percentage of the home, $335 million is sort of 2\/3 auto, 1\/3 home, just a clarification.","Susan Griffith","I remember several years back, it was actually while I did a presentation for the yearly IR presentation on imagine Diane. And Diana, I showed a graph of whole mobile payments. We talked about when Diane becomes a Robinsons, she is not going to certain start paying the check. So we to invest way back then into having more of those future Robinsons, we're able to do as much as they can on mobile.","Julia Hornack","Great. Andrew, can we take the next caller from the line, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Robert Glasspiegel","I was wondering if you could give us some dynamics in the homeowners rollout? What percentage is direct versus agency? And what is the relative profitability metrics of the 2 and growth as well?","Susan Griffith","First of all, I'll start with the fact that my daughter, her first accident was backing into At the time, I was running claims I was CEO. I can get worse than that right. That dynamics of the home, we continue to do roll out more and more agents, so that is growing on the direct side. Clearly, the HQX has been a big key that we rolled out last year that you can see sort of the hockey stick of where we're growing with that. So we're growing in both channels. We don't talk necessarily about profit or the target margins, I should say, in that aspect we always, I'm sure for 96 in the aggregate. So we don't talk publicly about where we're targeting either channel.","John Sauerland","Just for clarification, Bob. The property results we report in our monthly releases are the premium we're writing them through what we're not Progressive Home family as. We Steve, I believe mentioned also receiving commissions from the business that we write direct with our number of other carriers. But we also think the benefit of the currency we previously discussed around homeowners as being that auto PLE. So we showed you the relative policy life expectancy across Robinsons, Wrights, Diane and Sam, and the reason we are in the home is to get to that at least half of the marketplace, but to keep those auto customers, we've historically have been really good at bringing in those new customers to keep them for their lifetime for decades. That's the currency of the home. Obviously, that's, we previously talked about, the invisible balance sheet that we're building as a result of that PLE gain, but that's underline the profitability of your bill of home.","Robert Glasspiegel","What the discount you give to someone that buys both","John Sauerland","So the discount varies by product. There is a discount -- and generally speaking across states on both the home and auto, it varies by state and it varies by channel as well.","Robert Glasspiegel","It would be great before too long we get the homeowners broken up by agency and directly auto so that we can track the relative growth and profitabilities?","Susan Griffith","Yes. It is a little bit of tough, because to what John said in terms of not all of its on our paper. So where we have four homeowner carriers on one to be in Progressive Home, we have multiple on Progressive Advantage Agency. get a little tough look at premium even though getting commissions on some of those, but again auto PLE is our currency for that.","Julia Hornack","Thank you. Andrew, can we take the next call from the conference line, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","I just want to also say congratulations to Steve by adding one more customers to your $17 million customer base. So my first question is on your last slide. If you look at PLE have a tremendous growth, but seems like kind of reaching a plateau in the last couple of months. Your second quarter 3-month PLE data or increase have also slowed down from previous quarters. I was wondering are you reaching the limits or seasonality? How much more room to grow there?","Susan Griffith","I can't predict the future in that We obviously we've have grown a lot and so to continue to grow is our goal and to continue to keep customers for decades is our goal. Part of want the FX PLE and John Murphy had on this a little bit on price. So people care about the price watching that closely, because lot of our competition has increased prices those are slowing down a little bit. What I will tell you from the perspective of business is we're finding our new business conversion is still really strong. And so we're going to continue to look at PLE from the nature and nurture price expect and to continue to him make sure that we give our customers what they need to stay and understand that.","Kai Pan","Okay. My second question, Tricia, back to your shareholders letter for the 6 months results. You achieved remarkable like 90% commodity ratio, 20%-plus premium growth. You normally have one-off either of them having not of both. But going forward, do you think you will back on some of these margins or faster growth? Or do you think the growth rate is that as much as you can handle given the infrastructure, remember couple of years ago, in your ramp up your staffing to anticipate for this growth? So I was just wondering margin going to deteriorate for you to grow faster on top line? Or you want to keep the top line growth rate at it is and let the margin through?","Susan Griffith","That's a great question. Let's go back to our goal, and that is to grow fast as we can we are making at least $0.04 of underwriting profits. So when we have that ability to grow like we have and we have the margins like we have, we are really happy. We're really firing on all cylinders, and I think that's the key part here. We have a great infrastructure, an incredible brand, a competitive cost structure, and we have had no problem hiring great people across the company. So we don't believe where we have any need to slow down. Now when you step back and you look state-by-state, channel-by-channel, product-by-product, you started looking say we're still able to grow these margins. And if we don't believe we can grow then we will determine what we need to do to grow. But again, we look at it so surgically across so many variables, but again, I can't predict the future we're sitting in a great position right now, we're really bullish and excited about what we continue to do and again that momentum. So for me we're happy about our growth. Obviously, we're happy with our margin. We're going to continue to achieve our goal, and that is to -- our vision to become consumer's #1 choice and to grow as fast as we can, make $0.04 and take care of our customers. Anything, John?","John Sauerland","I think you have it. I would reiterate the success we had with staffing and attention to people has been remarkable. There have been points in the past where we're growing very quickly, and we were challenged by having appropriately trained mature staff to handle the claims an example to take the calls and John Murphy's organization, customer relationship management has done a fabulous job getting ahead of the projected need. Our service levels have been outstanding. And at the level of growth, where we are enjoying, that's really impressive. And the claim sites, similarly we have had a little benefit there and the fact that claims frequency has been dropping a bit. So we haven't had to add people quite as quickly in claims. We also found some efficiencies, the stuff like photo estimating. But in short, we feel great about quality metrics and claims. We feel great about service levels in our customer relationship management organization. So as Tricia said, we're sort of firing on all cylinders right now and want to continue to grow as rapidly as we can.","Susan Griffith","Yes. And think about we talk about, so we're excited about our Robinsons growth and we have less than 2% of shares. So I mean to think of the runway with that. We're well positioned and our mix shift is changing as well. So we've had our 83 Project we thought was fantastic to get more preferred customers end, our 84 project was even better and now we have 85 coming on the streets. So we're continually excited about our ability to attract and retain our preferred business. And so that mix shift changes, we believe there is lot of opportunities as well.","John Sauerland","And if 84 and 85 don't mean a lot to you, wait a quarter, we'll have Vice President give you a lot more to tell around our product, iterations, which we are happy to say we're hitting the market even faster than we had previously.","Susan Griffith","Yes. We're creating a lot of ways on how name our products.","Julia Hornack","Thanks. Andrew, can we take the next call from the conference call line, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","My question for a second quarter in a row, you guys pointed to favorable frequency trend. And we see that throughout the industry, I guess, a couple of questions, following on another quarter the favorable trends, what you guys think is driving the favorable auto frequency that we've seen in the industry? And when do you think we get to a point or maybe we say it's more of a new normal that the trends that persisted? What made the time to need to declare kind of a new home frequency base for the industry?","Susan Griffith","Yes. I have a lot of things going in frequency. It's really tough to pinpoint in particular, I just talked about clearly our mix shift is changing. You can go into a vehicle miles driven. If you look a lot of macroeconomic data, and it's hard to react quickly because things change along the way. So we're watching closely things like gas prices and unemployment and things like that. So you can change in any given quarter, and I can't tell you exactly when we'll say, okay, this is a new normal and we're going to price because prices severity. But we do watch those to kind of understand, where we're priced and what's happening in the macroeconomic atmosphere.","John Sauerland","We get this question often and Tricia pointed out, it's very difficult for us to even -- with the data we have around miles driven, types of miles driven, the economic data is such even explaining frequency changes that are past it's difficult for us, it's even more difficult to project them. We do know that the long-term trend has been negative. We expect it to be negative. When I say long-term, I'm talking about the past 4 decades. But if you look back within that 4-decade period, what you see is a lot of what variability. In the '80s, frequency was dropping dramatically. The '90s, it went back up and almost got back to where it was at the beginning of the '80s and it culminated with 2,000 combined ratio for the industry something like 112. We were a little below that, where we had 104-ish. You get to a point. After that frequency drops very quickly over the past decade or so, it's been fairly flat up or down a Bit. But I think those experiences even though the long-term trend is negative, make the industry less likely to quickly price to a drop in frequency. We have had six straight quarters now, I believe, frequency drop. But again, when you look back at the history, there is reason to be cautious and the key for us, I think, is ensuring that we are very agile, where we think things have changed. We act very quickly and make those changes in the marketplace. And I think that's a big piece how we win","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then there is a slide in the deck where you guys highlighted all the products that you are now offering to customers and compared back '18 to 2017. And so if you go back before you guys made ASI acquisition you always are identified opportunity to bundle with the auto and home customer, that was driving force there. Is there anything on this list that as you think about maybe to future acquisitions, something that you guys are not writing directly today, but providing to insurance that might the list of something you would want to take on the underwriting risk completely yourself?","Susan Griffith","I think for now, we're happy with Progressive Advantage Agency products. And -- or I should say over the products that were on the paper that are given to our insurance. If we believe we need to access like we did with ASI and we start with the partnership, that to us is important, because we knew in the homeowners area. We started out and we actually after with a great career, but just in market agency channel started a partnership with ASI knew they were on the same values as us. So that made sense to purchase, because we didn't have access to those customers and agency channel. We feel very comfortable with the product offering that we have and our ability to again extend our auto policies with the products on that side that we necessarily have to right on a paper.","Elyse Greenspan","And if I get one more quick one in. What's on the new money yield on the investment portfolio today?","Susan Griffith","Bill, you want to take that one? New money yield investment portfolio today.","William Cody","The New money yield on the investment portfolio, start with this that we run the portfolio in a total return basis, and we don't necessarily target a new money yield. In the second quarter, it was just a little bit over 3.5%. So going forward, I would just say, duration is around the same as 3-year treasury. And if you add a spread on top of that high quality, fixed-income bonds, you can get reasonable proximation of what money looks like.","Julia Hornack","Andrew, can we take the next call from the conference call line, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Michael Zaremski","Yes. Thanks for the info on the Robinsons growth versus the other customer types. Can you remind us the approximate combined ratio differential between Robinsons versus the Sam, Diane and Wrights?","Susan Griffith","I don't believe we shared it. So I think it would be.","John Sauerland","And our target for all those customer segments are the same. It's 96. So we obviously have different economics across channels with an upfront loading the direct channel, the commission over the lifetime. So the pricing is not necessarily the same, but the target profit margin across those 4 customer segments is the same -- across channels.","Michael Zaremski","Okay. I guess, you can -- you say -- you said a number of billion-dollar kind of invisible profits due to higher PLE. So I assume big chunk of that is coming from the Robinsons and more profitable, maybe I could through that more.","Susan Griffith","So you're talking about that last slide that John showed.","Michael Zaremski","Yes.","Susan Griffith","Yes. So when we look at that, we look at the entire book and we say, if we added a month to our entire book, how much would that be in lifetime premium. And then John take a percentage of that, percentage of increase in PLE. So we normally sound average if we add them on to our entire book, it's about $1.6 billion in lifetime and premium.","John Sauerland","So you might be confusing a new renewal split has been the same combined ratio, and it's not. So Robinson will stay for us for a longer than the Sam, for example. So that over the lifetime, we are achieving that 96 on a new customer versus renewal customer is dramatically different for Sam as you too from an acquisition because relative to Robinsons.","Susan Griffith","And the way our acquisition model works is very different depending upon what channel you arrive in.","Michael Zaremski","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And lastly, you talked about being optimistic about independent agents, potentially taking share from captives overtime and you're reasoning independent agents holding only one product. I thought that's kind of always been the case. So I'm trying to understand what's going to change for that market share dynamics to change?","Susan Griffith","Yes. I think the demographics are changing. So I think people expect to have multiple offerings wherever they go. So whether it's an insurance their online. And so I believe there is a demographic of being able to have more offerings, and you have seen some companies actually go that route from being captive to bring part of the independent agent channel. I think seeing that, it's very different to have only one product to have optionality to what fits on your lifestyle. That sort of our promise.","Julia Hornack","Andrew, can we take the next call from the conference call line, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome","You covered a lot of ground, thank you for that. I just wanted to retouch the 10-year effect impact of the growth. It seems like you had accelerating growth with no impact on the combined ratio, where the mass majority when we see this growth, you see some impact on the combined ratio from the growth itself, because new business is typically not as profitable as all. Is the 10-year effort in there? And we're just not seeing that? Is there something else that is going on that we are all good. Could you give us a sense of how you think this in the current book right now?","Susan Griffith","I think there is so many, John. So many things going on, but what we've been really impressed about and read about so much in my letter is the biggest part of our cost is loss cost. And being able to have our claims organization, higher well in advance, trained well in advance and have systems that can alert us to make sure we have that high-quality outcome and we have been obsessed with watching those files because of the low tenure and the claims organization to make sure that we have the right people handling the right files at the right time with the supervisor being able to get out in front of file that might be going sideways before it settled. So that's, I believe, a big part of it. We do usually have a new business panel. We've been in this mode for a while, where we've been having a lot of new business. So that's kind of started to level out a bit.","John Sauerland","To that, I would add, so we're going to try to understand how much better to grow new business. And we are conscious like I previously said, it's a 96 across channels all segments. We are actually cognizant of what we think the new renewal mix will be going into the air. So we say our target is that calendar year combined ratio less than 96, at the same time, we're looking at lifetime combined ratios for all those customer sites that we want to be within that 96 as well. So it's a balance across those 2 objectives, clearing the direct channel as you bring a lot of new business, those combined ratios are much higher than renewable and less differential. But increasingly, as we are moving the book to what's more preferred customers, the difference between the loss ratio for new customers on the Sam end is far bigger than the Robinson end. And then as we shift that book then the loss ratio a few put on the growth is far less.","Julia Hornack","Andrew, can we take the next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Banfield with and Partners.","Gary Ransom","I enjoyed your discussion on customer experience, I wanted to ask about another level of customer service that actually increases the opportunity to interact with customers. And this is may be at the product level, but it perhaps your snapshot, mobile may encourage additional interaction and also a product such as our pay by the mile might encourage additional interaction. I wonder if you could share thoughts on that level? And also more specifically, whether your been thinking about pay by the mile product?","Susan Griffith","We've been really focused from the snapshot perspective on having a more, we talked about is a mobile is a device. So actually using the phone to be able to understand the driving behavior, not just time a day, aggressive breaking our miles driven, but usage of your phone with an application or a phone call. So we're really trying to understand the behavior and the loss behavior that we have distracted driving. So that's really been our focus to understand with all the information we have at some point we can put that into a product model because of the data that we will have better drivers that have the mobile is a device versus a page ago.","Gary Ransom","So you don't have anything in the by the multi-product?","Susan Griffith","We're always thinking about things. Right now, we are focusing on mobile is a device in understanding the loss experiences for distracted driving as well as what we've always used as a huge editing variable. And when and talks the next quarter, we will talk a little bit about snapshot on the importance of that variable in terms of our ability to price and charge the right amount for the way people drive.","Gary Ransom","May be just one follow-up on snapshot. Is it your belief that you are -- truly is a reasonable amount or significant amount of adverse selection that you are causing and you are not alone, there are other peers that are using a similar product, but not very many? Is that actually making everyone else's loss ratio higher?","Susan Griffith","So I can't speak to the loss ratio of the competition. What I can say is that when our customers, who have driven with us and have a snapshot device get a surcharge often times they leave, which means that we're going to price them right, which is a high price. They didn't like it that to someone else and that to me sort of the definition the selection.","Julia Hornack","Andrew, can we take the next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber","What's the year-over-year increase in platinum agents? Or else could you give us that rough ballpark of percentagewise? How much increased?","Susan Griffith","I'm not sure percentagewise. We used to give the number and we kind of start giving that because a number. I think I'll number to that, I think, it's around might be a little of it. We look at platinum now less of we need to increase more agents, but in any given geographic area, where we believe that our Robinsons, do we need to have a more platinum agents in there. So that's really how we look at now because we feel like we have a good footprint across the country, but we do look and say okay, here we're not growing as much is it the agents, is it the ability to have those Robinsons walk into those agencies not kind of a next level of assessment in terms of our need for more platinum agents.","Adam Klauber","Okay. And then a follow-up. A point to your 10-Q, seems pretty low has been improving, look like it's only 2%, that's materially better than the industry looks like it's improved compared to year ago. I guess, what are you doing better in the industry? And how are you improving severity in a tough time for severity?","Susan Griffith","I mean, I think from what I understood, it wasn't that different from the industry, 2, 2.5. We always obviously I talked about looking at making sure we are accurate in our payments to make sure we have the right level of people looking at our files because that's our biggest cost. And we have a an incredible training organization to be able to do that incredible leadership organization that claims area. And that's really what we look at this him in terms of making sure we get out there quickly, we have the customer and we help to manage the claim.","Julia Hornack","Andrew, we'll take the next call from the conference call line, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","Two questions, I think, touching on issues have been raised in the Q&A. First, to the extent that you are winning business either in independent agency or direct from captive agents, those customers are different either loss or PLEs than longer-term independent agent other customers?","Susan Griffith","There will be able to really actually see that data from that right now, I mean, it's more of -- I would look at it in terms of the types of customers. The customers that have multiple products, the customers that have more to take care, the customers that have the credit, all the things that we look at in terms of proof of priors, some of those things are company look for it's really the variables that we look at versus where they come from. Do you want to add anything too?","John Sauerland","I think that's truly","Meyer Shields","Okay. That's helpful. And second, I have to agree to the point you made that demographically, we're going to see an increased focus on having options. Does that diminish the value of the brand recognition improvement that you have been fostering?","Susan Griffith","No, I don't think so at all. I think our brand recognition will tell you, especially HQX Progressive Advantage Agency that we want to have Progressive Home. We also have different options for you. So I think we actually have highlighted that and some of our commercials and arguably the commercials we talked about HQX, we're doing it to make sure brand recognition our own home, and it improved our prospects on both home and auto. So we feel like it's actually getting better.","John Sauerland","I would add. I think the relative to competitors, we are the brand that is known for providing customers options.","Susan Griffith","Steve used the line in his presentation that was in the commercial years ago, when we used to have compared which we have to it was we're not always the lowest. And so that's kind of been our claim to fame to make sure we have the transparent company about saying you're better off getting going with XYZ. So we're part of that.","Julia Hornack","Thank you. And I'm actually going to, I think, you said, 2800 platinum agents.","Susan Griffith","Yes. Is that wrong?","Julia Hornack","No. You're close. Almost 2,900 agents of 45% since last June.","Susan Griffith","So I've ever reported a month ago. So must have add","Julia Hornack","Exactly. Andrew, can we take another caller from the conference line, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meritor with UBS.","Brian Meredith","So just curious you've had at the ton of success here and lots of growth going on, but growth obviously requires capital. And I know you had the preferred offering. Just curious where are you with respect able to sustain or observe this growth here on your current capital position? And then what are your alternatives going forward given that your leverage ratio is up a little bit?","Susan Griffith","Yes. I mean, we look at capital in terms of need from many different areas and we wrote a paragraph about in the Q. As we grow, we're going to need more regulatory capital to hit the premium to surplus. So we will continue to watch that, that's a good problem to have. We have dividends, we have a lot of different things that go into our capital structure and of course, our debt-to-total capital ratio we usually talk about in a 30% range. If we believe we need capital to continue to grow, we'll determine what that means whether it's issuing debt or in the past. So we look at that on a monthly basis to kind of understand our need, but we believe we see that as a good problem in terms of growth in our ability to get that if we need it.","Brian Meredith","Yes, I don\u2019t disagree, just wondering, your willingness to the equity capital.","Susan Griffith","We review it every time we go to market to determine where we should go with that, and what makes the most sense in terms of returns. So we do that as needed.","Brian Meredith","Got you. And my next question, obviously, great growth in homeowners is going terrific. How do you think about managing volatility that homeowners potentially I know you've got some great arrangements in place right now to do that, I assume, it's getting bigger and bigger, bigger and it's harder to manage their volatility and I guess, what's the run rate here you got -- you may run into some concerns about that?","Susan Griffith","Well, firstly, I think is really understanding segmentation in the home as much as we do on the auto side. So we're working very closely with the 2 R&D departments to understand the type of homes we should ride and obviously want to expand our coverage, not only just geographically, but to more homes. So we are watching that you understand, okay, this is the segment that we believe really fits in our in our real house. In addition to that, as you know, we added the aggregate last year and has been helpful and we feel really good about our insurance. So I think it's really about having a solid reinsurance plan and kind of understanding what we can on the history of weather and where we should write and how we should rate those homes and also continuing to segment homes as we do auto.","John Sauerland","A lot of that growth is actually lessening our concentration risk geographically. So that getting bigger they're actually, I think, helps the volatility. The aggregate surplus agreement is not depending upon how big we are, it's a percentage across-the-board. So it's not dependent on sites.","Susan Griffith","Our goal is to continue to grow extensively in home and auto unbundled.","Julia Hornack","Thank you. We will take one last caller from the conference call line. Please, Andrew.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman, Balyasny Asset Management.","Ian Gutterman","I just had two quick ones. First on the homeowners, I guess, sort of go back on history right, ASI before acquire them was obviously very overweight Florida and Texas I recall and is a middle of the country obviously had a lot of these other partners. And now, first, I talk a little bit about how much of the non-coastal growth as you fill out the math? Should we assume that on the margin most of that will be ASI? And secondly to the extent that it is, can you just talk about what I'm really concerned about something for future call is the infrastructure build out in states where you are heavily concentrated, right. If Tennessee or Nevada or something like or maybe where you don't have homes and you have a lot of auto customers and people are now to call in. How quickly can you build that home infrastructure because there is a lot different than our infrastructure, right? so maybe I'll leave it there and let you start answering that.","Susan Griffith","Yes. So obviously as we expand on the agency channel, it will all be Progressive Home off. On the direction channel, we have multitude carrier. So really is the best fit for the customer. We only talk about the percentage get from each of the unaffiliated partners with Progressive Home at the direct side. We have lots of options to fill up the country. From an infrastructure perspective, we have made a commitment and investment on the claims organization to have offices across the country. We have hundreds and hundreds of officers across the country. For the most part in home, we use independent agents for the homes. So the infrastructure is already built out with our partnerships that, but we do have an opportunity to actually leverage our already infrastructure on the auto claims had with the leadership we had there. So and we also have our large losses and complicated losses, a very large kind of high value or high kind of loss organization here that handles any of those big claims on the commercial side, on the home side. And so we have an infrastructure build from the home we believe we can utilize for auto, for home as well as the fact that traditionally we've used independent agents across the country.","John Sauerland","Yes, our writing a lot of the estimates for homes and states, where we don't have a lot of business yet. You're right about that for sure. But each of those files is owned by an adjuster that is an employee that is reviewing those estimates and reviewing coverage as well. So while there is some delegation of the adjusting process, it is still owned by an employee.","Ian Gutterman","I assume the goal overtime as you get more critical more in certain states may be counties that you start to replace that independence with more of your own people when you have enough skill to do so?","John Sauerland","I'm sorry, that's an absolutely what we've been doing as we grow in states in which we don't have a ton of business yet. So the claims organization for Progressive Home is growing very rapidly.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. And then just quick follow-up about you earlier questions about an 86, I may be asked a little differently. Obviously, you've been in the 96 a fair amount for a number of years, let's say, a target on it, but somewhat down the line, you go from 2% of Robinsons to call it 10% Robinsons. Just given the longer PLE, they can sustain a higher combined ratio. Is it reasonable to expect that over the longer-term sort of neutral or be a smaller margin versus the 96, which isn't a bad thing is probably a good thing because the PV that is higher. But just from a GAAP perspective, is that something we should expect to happen overtime?","Susan Griffith","I wouldn't necessarily go to that. Remember, it wasn't long ago in 2016 that we were over 96 for the quarter we came in at 95.7, I believe. That my memory in my mind since its was my first quarter as CEO. But 96, again, we have been writing about this is our first annual public in 1971. So we will continue to look at the 96 aggregate for all of our coverages. And again, they are different, but we optimize to the aggregate. So what we will do whatever we can to grow as fast as we can, make at least $0.04 to service our customers, and that's really sort of -- that's our blueprint. And then everything else we can to fit into that. This is a 96 is and it is what we do here it's our culture and it is really is served us so well for our 8 years.","Ian Gutterman","Absolutely. I just tried to think spreadsheet here as you have more, more success with the Robinsons mathematically little bit natural optical pressure, right, not economic profits fantastic, but nominally I was thinking there was a mix change, I guess, if you're well that makes the 96 little harder. Does it make sense? Or I'm the other way?","Susan Griffith","Yes. I think we're coming from new we just have to play it out and see how it goes as we continue to increase our mix of business.","John Sauerland","I would just to reiterate. As we go into a calendar year, we know our calendar target is 96 or better, and we can project that we expect those combined ratios are by segment and by new renewal, and we can adjust our target pricing accordingly to make sure best sure as we can that we're below that 96 for the calendar year.","Julia Hornack","Thank you. So we've actually exhausted our scheduled time. So Andrew, I'm going to hand it back to you for the closing scripts.","Operator","Thank you.

The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the Letter to Shareholders, which have been posted to the company\u2019s website. And we\u2019ll use this conference call to respond to questions. Acting as moderator for the call will be Julia Hornack.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Ms. Hornack.","Julia Hornack","Thank you, Marcia. Good morning. Welcome to Progressive\u2019s conference call. Joining us on today\u2019s call are our CEO, Tricia Griffith; our CFO, John Sauerland and our Chief Investment Officer, Bill Cody. The call is scheduled to last an hour.","As always, our discussions on this call may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during this call. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions on the risks, uncertainties and other challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investors page of our website, progressive.com.","Before we open the call to questions, I would like to turn the call over to Tricia?","Tricia Griffith","Thank you, Julia. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the first quarter call. First of all, I\u2019m very pleased with our results for the first quarter and we look forward to answering your questions.","Before that, I\u2019d like to outline some changes we are making starting with the second quarter call that is currently scheduled for the first week of August. We will be moving away from the Q&A format that we\u2019ve been doing for quite some time. In place of solely questions-and-answers on the call, we will have a webcast each quarter.","The webcast will begin with a presentation on a specific topic that either you have previously expressed interest in or one that we believe that is relevant to this audience, while at the same time providing exposure to other leaders of Progressive.","Following the presentation, we will answer your questions about both the presented topic and quarterly results. To accommodate this agenda, we will lengthen the event to 90 minutes.","Our first topic will be what we call our runway project, and it will be presented by John Curtis. He is the leader of our Personal Auto Product Development Group within our R&D Department.","We know that there\u2019s a great deal of interest in the opportunities and challenges that evolving vehicle technology present. John plans to discuss the industry trends, including long-term frequency and severity. In addition, he\u2019ll outline what information we are collecting, both internally and through the third parties, regarding vehicle technology trends and how that data might influence our future product design.","We truly hope this format will provide you with more current information on the topics that interest you rather than a once-a-year Annual Investor Relations Meeting. Details on how to access that webcast and conference call lines will be provided during July.","At this time, Marcia, we\u2019re ready to take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operating Instructions] The first question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Good morning. My first question is just about your accident year ex-cat loss ratio. As the new business that you guys rolled last year\u2019s seasons and loss cost just for the industry appeared to be moderating, as we think about the balance of the year from here, do you expect to see continued improvement in your underlying ex-cat accident year loss ratio?","Tricia Griffith","Well, a lot of it has to do with the business that we\u2019re bringing on the books and that will be reflected in our loss ratio. We are bringing on, as noted in the Q as well as my letter, a much more - a higher percentage of preferred customers, which frequently calls for less losses. So while we can\u2019t predict what will happen from a loss perspective, we are working continually and diligently to bring on more of our preferred customers from both how we align our product and of course, our auto and home bundles.","Trevor Hillier","I\u2019d add to that that we have raised rates, a good deal in 2016 and that is in the process of what we could call earnings into the book, took about 5.5 points of rate in our auto programs, about 9.5 points in our Commercial Lines program and we\u2019ve continued to raise rates at a bit slower clip, but still materially raise rates through the first quarter. So that obviously helps the loss ratio throughout the rest of the year as well.","Elyse Greenspan","Great. And then my second question in terms of following up on the bundling concept. Can you provide some disclosure or numbers on how have you seen a pickup in terms of your customers that are purchasing both the auto and home products? And information just on the penetration of that Platinum product? And then also just where the bundling stands today within your book compared to when you announced that ASI acquisition and the potential additional bundling from here?","Tricia Griffith","Absolutely, Elyse. So first and foremost, we call our bundled customers with auto and home Robinsons, we refer to that internally, and I think a lot of you are familiar with that. Our new business Robinsons quarter-over-quarter are up 50%, our PIPs are up 25% year-over-year. And as noted, and really very exciting to us, is the retention on the Robinson cohort is up over 25%.","So we build Robinsons in three different areas. Let me focus first on Platinum and the Agency brands. So initially, when we rolled out Platinum, it really was about integrating the sales force from ASI and making sure we could really accommodate the changing needs of this product and help our agents make sure that they knew both our auto and our home to bundle that. So we continue to move forward. And I think I said in a couple earlier calls that it was moving a little bit slower and the integration took longer, we\u2019ve gotten over that hurdle and we feel really positive about our ability to continue to roll out the Platinum products.","ASI were in 41 states, 35 of those we have Platinum agents. We plan to double Platinum agents this year as well. So we feel very positive about the momentum and the relationships that we have with these agents and really their commitment to quarterly results, and we know when they don\u2019t meet those results that we talk about that wisdom, change course, determine what they need.","John Sauerland has talked about, in the October meeting, how we\u2019re really focusing on whether it would be in each area, each state, I should say, is the auto product competitive, is the home product competitive and where we find that they\u2019re not, we make accommodations to possibly broaden coverage and to be able to sell a great bundled product. So while we\u2019re not sharing specific results in terms of percentages, the momentum continues as planned, and I\u2019m really excited about that.","On the direct side, we have what we call our Progressive Advantage Agency. And they have been really doing an incredible job. Now of course, we write more than ASI in the direct channels, so these are customers that have our auto and they call in as our inside agency, they call in and we fit them with the product that best suits their home. So it could be with ASI and we have nine other unaffiliated partners.","We have grown our Advantage Agency, our in-house agency by several hundred in the last couple of years. So that\u2019s gained a lot of momentum and we feel very positive about that continuing. Just recently, we rolled out what we call [ph] home quote explorer (09:36) and that is consistent with our customers wanting to buy where, when and how philosophy.","And this is a very slick online process where you can get a quote and we\u2019ll match you up with the company that is best for you with your home and then currently you make a call at the end of that process online to buying in our in-house agency. That is just up and running. We have eight states and we continue to learn from that and our plan is to roll out many more states throughout the year.","So we certainly have the trifecta of Platinum is really going well in the Agency brand and we\u2019re seeing that momentum really gain speed. The Progressive Advantage Agency has done actually even above what we had kind of planned and we\u2019re excited about that and now we have the online version. So while we don\u2019t share right now the percentage, but we\u2019ll get to that at some point when we believe it\u2019s meaningful. And I imagine at some point, the overall home products and Robinson will be a topic for this quarterly webcast because that\u2019s I think of interest to all of you, so possibly a future topic to go into a little bit more detail on the metric.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Tricia Griffith","Thank you, Elyse.","Julia Hornack","We\u2019ll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan","Thank you, and good morning, and also thank you for your flexibility, moving the time of the call. The first question on catastrophe losses that we have seen rising frequency or severity of the weather events and I just wonder how are you thinking about managing the volatility as well as your cost of capital, specifically, is that 2.4 points cat load in 2016 a new normal for you guys given the business mix change towards property lines?","Tricia Griffith","Well, clearly, we watch the weather and we look at a 10-year look back and then obviously, we continue to look at that more frequently to see what type of cat load we put in. Cats were not unexpected in first quarter and are not too dissimilar to first quarter of 2016, even a little bit less.","So we put that load in. And obviously, we watch for it. And when we think of, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with weather, so we do our best to make sure that one, we are ahead of pricing when we need to take great actions and that we\u2019re, more importantly, ready to handle those claims when they happen. So although cats can be very - we can\u2019t plan them, we can\u2019t plan how we react to them.","On the home front, as you know, we have purchased an aggregate stop-loss on coverage from the cats. Home is much more obviously volatile and expensive when cats happen than autos and I can have Trevor Hillier talk a little bit more about that or John Sauerland because they were involved in this. But for the most part, we were really trying to cap our losses when we went into this aggregate stop-loss agreement.","So we decided to do this after our [ph] data re (13:02) bond had expired. And what we really wanted to do was to limit our downside. So we already have the name storms taken care of, but we wanted to have additional protection with perils such as winter storm, which of course happened this first quarter, earthquakes, fires, things like that.","And that agreement caps our loss and LAE, non-name storms and liability to a 63% combined ratio. So we feel really - I\u2019m sorry, loss ratio. So we really think that was a good play for us to make sure, especially as we diversify throughout the company, to more and more states to cap our exposure on the home side. Trevor, do you want to add anything on that?","Trevor Hillier","No, I think you summed it up well. But the aggregate stop-loss, it helps quite a bit, just as Tricia mentioned. The [ph] Gata Re aggregate contraction (13:57) was limited to just severe thunderstorms. So it does add those perils that we\u2019re seeing, especially as we expand our footprint across the country and as we did it - we\u2019re looking at it as a percentage of our premium in terms of reinsurance costs, we can get a very reasonable deal for the additional coverage that we\u2019re getting.","Kai Pan","Great. Thank you. A follow-up is on your PIP growth in the direct channel, been slowing sort of like decelerating, like since mid of 2016. And recently, in your report, in your letter, Tricia you mentioned increasing media spending. Are we going to see acceleration of like a PIP growth and will that becoming sort of like a drag on the other hand on the so-called new business penalty?","Tricia Griffith","The slowdown in fourth quarter of advertising was very deliberate. So we make a commitment to our shareholders that we will try to reach the 96, we will reach the 96 and grow as fast as we can. And when we had a really heavy cat year last year, we were taking measures to make sure that we reach that 96. And so we did purposefully reduce our advertising in the fourth quarter. So the reduction in new apps on the direct side was very deliberate and it\u2019s exactly what we planned. We are in a different position, coming into 2017. We\u2019ve increased our spend with increase in spend, normally that will increase prospects for sales and ultimately the big test conversion. We are seeing that starting to happen, and I can\u2019t tell you exactly how that will turn out, but we feel confident and comfortable in our spend in advertising and that it will have a positive impact on our business in direct growing in terms of new business apps and ultimately PIP.","As far as media spend, like I said, we are back in [indiscernible] (16:05) and we look at media spend really, what we call, targeted acquisition costs and we want to make sure that our targeted acquisition cost is and our cost per sale are in alignment and as long as we feel like we are spending money and getting the sales at the right cost, we\u2019ll continue to spend and do it as inefficiently as we can - as efficiently as we can, sorry.","Kai Pan","Do you worry about the increasing new business penalty?","Tricia Griffith","I don\u2019t because we - when we bring new business on, we look at our new business targets and we know that those flow through. And if we\u2019re over our new business targets, then we slow down or we take action in terms of either ratings or underwriting actions. But we believe if we can bring our new business at\/or below targets, then they play out. I talked about this in the October IR meeting. It\u2019s really about the economics of bringing in new business, it\u2019s very different.","So to answer that question, it\u2019s dependent and how we look at the economics is very dependent on channels and segments. And if you recall, bringing in new business on the direct side is very expensive in the first term, because we front-load all those acquisition costs, but if we\u2019re bringing that right business and they say that second term is substantially down and we ultimately get to our both calendar year and lifetime 96, a little bit different on the Agency side.","And then of course, the next tranche would be it\u2019s very different on the direct side if you\u2019re looking at a Sam or a Robinsons. So we calculate what the sort of a new business drag should be and when that will fall off and it\u2019s really all about getting the right business in at\/or below our target.","Kai Pan","That\u2019s great. Thank you so much.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks Kai.","Julia Hornack","We\u2019ll take the next question please, Marcia?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney. Your line is open.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning, Progressive, I\u2019m excited about your new format and hope you can dodge the [indiscernible] (18:29) with the 90-minute call, which will be much appreciated. My questions are on the commercial auto side of the ledger. Tricia, you seem to have a bounce in your step and in your letter commenting that you\u2019re now positioned to grow that business again, it came in under a 90 combined in the first quarter with March having a weather impact, I suspect. Where are you in commercial auto cycle relative to your competitors? They need to take price, presumably other people are seeing pressures that you saw earlier. Are you in a position to get back to double-digit growth in that business with where - the rates that you\u2019ve taken?","Tricia Griffith","Thanks, Bob. We are excited about our Commercial growth. So as you know, and we were part of that third quarter, last year, we saw frequency increase substantially. We took a step back and took some rate action in September, about 9% in aggregate. Now across the book, it was very different depending on our business marketing tier to get what we needed.","So that is still earning in, because clearly you do a rate revision per each day and we also have annual policies. So we believe we have the right rate and we\u2019re going to keep ahead of trend. So that was very exciting.","And then the second thing we did, just to understand and get more enhanced in our segmentation in each of those segments in Commercial is we had some underwriting restrictions for that time period until the end of March. About mid-March, we made the decision at the end of March to lift many of those underwriting restrictions because we really believe we have the right rates and the right segmentation to bring on that business at or below our targets.","So we are positive about our growth. We saw pretty immediately and we believe we have the right rate, once we lifted those underwriting restrictions, new app growth start up again. The great thing about Progressive is that we do react to rate need very quickly. So even in a channel that takes a little bit longer to earn in than our auto as a majority [indiscernible] (20:58) policies, we feel very positive that we got out ahead of trend quickly as we saw those frequency trends increase. So we\u2019re seeing a very hard market. We obviously watch the competition closely and people are getting a lot of rate. We feel very good, very positive about our growth in Commercial.","Bob Glasspiegel","I think you averaged under 90 over the last decade in that segment and have a dominant market share along with Trevor\u2019s. How do you think about what your goals are in this segment because it doesn\u2019t seem like it operates with the same 96 parameter that your auto - your Personal Auto business does?","Tricia Griffith","Yes, definitely, Commercial can be more volatile and especially, when you have annual policies, if you don\u2019t react quickly, you can get caught behind rapidly. So we\u2019re number one in Commercial Auto and we\u2019re very proud of that. We also know that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity out there. So we\u2019re creating a business auto policy to be able to really delve deeply into the Commercial part of the company as much as we have on the Auto.","So think of how we outlined several years ago our Destination Era on the auto part. We\u2019re doing very similar things on the Commercial part. So we\u2019re really thinking about that small business owners and their needs. And so John Barbagallo and his team are working on the addressable market to have not just the auto, but other products, whether we manufacture them or not, we\u2019ll be manufacturing the [indiscernible] (22:42) product, but to enhance that, what you\u2019d almost consider the Commercial Auto Destination Era. It\u2019s a $300 billion opportunity, and along with the $300 billion opportunity on the Auto and Home, we feel like we\u2019re really positioned across the company for a long runway and a lot of growth. So we\u2019re going to continue to try to be number 1 in Commercial Auto because we\u2019re proud of that but we know we need to do more for our customers that expect more. So again, we\u2019re going to have the products and services they need, not unlike what we rolled out in Auto a few years ago.","Bob Glasspiegel","Can I squeeze in one more or might be a lot, [ph] let me know (23:22)?","Tricia Griffith","Go ahead.","Julia Hornack","\u2026one more.","Q - Bob Glasspiegel:","Okay. Does this fit into Uber and Carpool strategy as well to have this business segment?","Tricia Griffith","Yes. But let me talk about how I think about Progressive in the future in terms of that. So what I just described right now, I think about it in horizon, three horizons. So what I just described in both the Auto and Commercial segments are really surgically executing on things we know we can do well right now, so picture now in the next four or five years. I want our focus to really be on our ability to capitalize on having great rate, great service, improved retention and the products and services our customers need.","When I think of Uber and the sharing economy and other things, we\u2019re clearly working on those right now for that next horizon, think maybe 4 to 8 or 4 to 10 years. And we just recently renewed our Uber contract actually in April with our Commercial business in Texas. And so we\u2019re enthusiastic to continue to learn more and work with Uber. In addition, on the Personal Auto side, we continue to add endorsements in many, many states to cover Uber drivers during the time that they\u2019re working. So I see Uber, sharing economy, think of all that type of things, [indiscernible] (24:52) some knowns and some unknowns that we should be working on now in the R&D portion of the company to roll things out probably more aggressively in that horizon 2.","And then horizon 3 which we touched on a little bit during the August webcast is really about autonomous. So whether it\u2019s autonomous vehicles, autonomous commercial vehicles, autonomous P&C vehicles, how we think about that, how we\u2019re working with third parties to gather data and understand how we need to continue to set up the company to be an enduring business.","Bob Glasspiegel","Thank you. Look forward to hearing about that.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks Bob.","Julia Hornack","All right, thanks, Bob. Marcia, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your line is open.","Adam Klauber","Thanks. Good morning. A couple questions around bundling. One, you mentioned that bundling capability is up and running in 35 states today. What was that roughly a year ago?","Tricia Griffith","I\u2019d have to check on that.","Trevor Hillier","And to be clear, that was in the 8 independent - direct channel versus the countrywide...","Tricia Griffith","Yes, direct channel, we\u2019ve been doing for a while and that was, we\u2019re in 41 states, the Platinum was in the 35. So we actually do have Auto and Home with ASI in the Agency channel in 41 states. I would check on that number because I hate to guess, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have that readily available and I can let you know that.","Adam Klauber","Okay. Thank you. And as far as Snapshot, around how much of your, I guess, policy in force or your policy base [ph] hazards current (26:43) using Snapshot today versus a year or two years ago?","Tricia Griffith","It\u2019s different in the direct channel and the agency channel, much higher in the direct channel. I think John, correct me [indiscernible] (26:54), I think it\u2019s up 35% or maybe 33% in direct. So a fair amount. From the Snapshot perspective, I wrote in my letter that we rolled out our Snapshot mobile. And so we did that in four states in December. And then as of today, this morning, we rolled out in another 22 states. So we are excited about mobile for a couple of reasons. One, because it just fits with the changing technology environment. Two, it\u2019s much less expense on our side, and three, we believe and I\u2019m not in the position right now to talk too much because it\u2019s still early on, but talk too much about segmentation enhancements that we believe we will garner from the mobile as a device. So in terms of talking on the phone, handheld, whether you\u2019re on a phone or on an application, so we believe that we\u2019re going to get and we\u2019re seeing already some interesting data on the mobile as a device. So we are excited about that. Adam, to answer your first question, we were in 16 states with Platinum a year ago.","Adam Klauber","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then also back to the bundling, not asking for an exact number, but you\u2019re clearly growing a lot in the Robinsons, you\u2019ve given us some good statistics. Is that more in the agency channel than the direct channel?","Tricia Griffith","No, it\u2019s actually in both channels. And I think our approach was really to be available when, where and how. And so the agency channel, I would sort of say, last year, had not gained the momentum that we\u2019re starting to see now. And our direct channel was a little bit easier because our customers already have auto with us and they were interested in home, so we were able to have ASI and many other carriers help them, whereas in the agency channel, it\u2019s a little bit different because it may be a customer that doesn\u2019t have a Progressive or an ASI product they were coming in. And so it\u2019s new to some of these agents and the whole process is new. So I would say we\u2019re happy about both channels as well as our ability to roll out the online version.","Adam Klauber","Okay. And just one more follow-up. So online, you mentioned you\u2019re quoting homeowners now. You put up that new system. Are you actually quoting a bundle online or is that being quoted separately?","Tricia Griffith","You\u2019re able to do that at the end. So yes, that\u2019s the whole theory is to be able to be in one place at one time. The only caveat is that you don\u2019t - you\u2019re not able to [ph] buy into (29:38) the home part online and so you talk to our agents in the Progressive Advantage Agency currently.","Adam Klauber","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Julia Hornack","Thank you. Marcia, we\u2019ll take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. I just had a couple of follow-ups and then a broader question, but I guess on the last question about Snapshot and this may have been something you guys have touched on in the past, but is there a meaningful difference in frequency between a driver who isn\u2019t on Snapshot and then goes to Snapshot?","Tricia Griffith","A very little.","Ryan Tunis","So there\u2019s not like a someone\u2019s watching me in the backseat type of thing that would make someone a more careful driver?","Tricia Griffith","We have - we do have the ability to alert you to let you know when you\u2019re doing things like hard braking and things like that that can influence us, so you know what we\u2019re looking at. Ultimately, there\u2019s sort of your DNA as a driver and usually and we believe that we\u2019re able to gather the type of driver you are and ultimately how that will lead to a loss cost pretty early on just with what we\u2019ve looked at in terms of time of day, hard braking, et cetera.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. And then just following on Kai\u2019s question on the media spend. Is there a way we can think about, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s year-over-year in terms of the expense ratio [indiscernible] (13:13) that you\u2019re thinking the higher media spend will have or perhaps just a percent increase that you kind of have in your mind in terms of what you\u2019re thinking you might spend on media over the entire year?","Tricia Griffith","We always do. We don\u2019t necessarily share this. We do a budget at the beginning based on all of our models of how we believe the year and several years will roll out. And what we look at from our expense ratio is, we look at it, we bifurcate it. We look at our overall expense ratio and then we look at our non-acquisition expense ratio. And so that way, we can firm up activities that we do on the efficiency side as well as advertising spend.","We truly look at advertising with the caveat that we do have a stated goal for our shareholders to grow at a 96 or less, and so we look at advertising as - if we can get it efficiently and our targeted acquisition cost, our cost per sale is less than our targeted acquisition cost, then we will increase our spend.","And so we buy a majority of our media in-house and we are very in tune with how much to spend, when we think the incremental spend is worth it and actually we\u2019re working on more recently just the lifetime value of different customers coming in the door and how much we think we should spend on each of those customers and getting much more detailed on that.","So the short answer is, we\u2019ll spend as much as we can with the right amount, knowing that we have promises that we made to our shareholders in terms of profitability. And it\u2019s all about getting things at or below the targets that we set.","Ryan Tunis","Got it. And then, I guess, my last one was just on the competitive environment in general today versus 6 or 12 months ago, because I think we\u2019ve seen some competitors that have, I guess, started to lean in on rate more recently, others that had been doing it every 24 months ago that seem to be coming back to the marketplace. Would you say it\u2019s more competitive today than it was 6 or 12 months ago or are you still benefiting from either a new business or retention standpoint from a lot of competitors taking rate? Thanks.","Tricia Griffith","From our competitive intelligence, we are seeing a pretty hard market. So we\u2019re seeing people take a fair amount of rate. Like Johnson, we took about 5.5 points last year, this quarter, we took a little bit over 1 point. But we are seeing shopping. So we do believe that we\u2019re benefiting from, one, having a competitive product, a competitive price and more consumer shopping.","Julia Hornack","All right, I think that we\u2019ll take the next question, please. Marcia?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is open.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. Tricia, I wanted to follow up on your response to Kai, because if I understood you correctly, what you were saying is that you pulled back advertising spend and whatever sort of long-term value creation was associated with that because of sort of short-term capacity losses, which seems a little bit [indiscernible] (34:37). Am I thinking about that the wrong way?","Tricia Griffith","No. We, sometimes, because we have that commitment to a 96, we sometimes take a short-term, not be able to take advantage of something very short-term to get to our long-term goal. We make that commitment. We\u2019re very public about that. For me, it\u2019s about making sure that we care as much about the bottom line as the top line. So yes, it was very deliberate when we pulled back advertising. We knew that that might - we might have some mid-short-term opportunities, but we really take our commitment to shareholders very seriously and we did what we could to make sure we got to that 96.","So there\u2019s a couple ways you can do that. We felt like we had the right rate and we\u2019ve made so much movement on retention that we didn\u2019t want to just raise rates and have people leave because of that. We felt like we were in a good position, pulled back a little bit, obviously, we care a lot internally about expenses as well, so we made some changes internally on the expense ratio side and the loss adjustment ratio side. But yeah, we knew that we might have some short-term opportunities missed, but it is very much in keeping with our philosophy of making at least $0.04 of underwriting profit.","Meyer Shields","No, I completely get it. How would I put it, I trust you enough to say maybe the commitment should be changed, not that you\u2019re doing anything inconsistent with what you said. Second question, completely unrelated. Does the current sort of freefall in used car pricing, is that something that can affect underwriting results in the near term?","Tricia Griffith","I don\u2019t know if I could be able to speculate on that. I think it\u2019s really dependent on really [indiscernible] (36:30) losses, and I guess, in terms of severity on the [indiscernible] (36:35) PD side. We\u2019ll start to see that and we\u2019ll react to that when we see it. I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate it, but we obviously are keeping our eyes on both new car sales as well as used cars prices and [ph] salvage (36:44) prices.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.","Julia Hornack","Thanks. All right, we\u2019ll take the next question please, Marcia?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open.","Brian Meredith","Yeah. Thank you. Just couple quick questions for you. First, just to follow-up on that, the severity increases you saw in the quarter, BI severity up 6%, PD up 7%. Anything to read into that. I believe the BI was just versus a pretty tough comp?","Tricia Griffith","Yeah. And I think we\u2019re seeing things not unlike what the industry thinks. So - and I will say we\u2019re seeing little bit [indiscernible] (37:22) time of loss. So we know that will equate to possibly higher payments and we\u2019re baking that into our pricing indications. On PD as well, everyone I think is looking at paying the right amount. So when we talk about share liability, we\u2019re seeing that a little bit on the PD side. But again, we have put that into our pricing indications. And Gary, do you want to add anything on that? This is Gary Traicoff, our Chief Actuarial...","Gary Traicoff","Sure. Hi, Brian. I think to your point, when we look at BI severity, in the last quarter, we were about 6%. Our paid severity is a little bit lower than that. So we know it\u2019s lagging a little bit, to Tricia\u2019s point, about the [ph] attorney wrapped (38:11) inventory going up a little bit. When we still look at our overall severity on a trailing 12-month calendar basis over the prior 12 months, we were up about 4% on BI. And to Tricia\u2019s point, we\u2019ve built that into our pricing and reserving overall, so we feel pretty comfortable where we\u2019re at with that as well.","On the PD side, we were up this last quarter, part of that was just some closures and some inventory shifting. On an accident period basis, we see PD more in the 5% range and that\u2019s pretty close to what you see [ph] riding (38:45) on the long-term calendar period as well.","Brian Meredith","Great. And then just I\u2019ve got a quick question, on the mobile app with Snapshot. Is the difference in cost, one, the difference in cost significant enough that we would see it actually in your expense ratio over time here? And then I\u2019m also just curious, on that, the mobile app, can you detect distracted driving and will that give you some better insight into distracted driving?","Tricia Griffith","Great questions, Brian. Yes, that\u2019s one of the reasons why years ago, we knew after a certain period, say 60 days, that we were able to identity driving trends of our [ph] EBI (39:27) drivers. So that was a big difference in terms of the dongle devices, and as we go to mobile, it\u2019s even less expensive and ultimately we\u2019ll get that data from the cars. So yes, we will see that as part of our expense ratio.","As far as distracted driving, yes, when you [indiscernible] (39:51) as I\u2019m driving, I\u2019ll see someone, I\u2019m like what are they doing [indiscernible] (39:54), see them on the phone or on an app and it\u2019s frustrating, but we really like to make sure we have the data to confirm things.","So anecdotally we all think that, but the mobile device will give us much more insight into actual distraction. And whether I\u2019m talking on the phone hands-free or I\u2019m holding my phone or there\u2019s an app open, we\u2019ll be able to at some point correlate that to loss cost. So we believe that distracted driving more than likely has influencing on losses, but we want to be able to have that data to confirm it. So we\u2019re excited about gathering that data. It will take some time, but as we gather more and we feel more confident in that, we\u2019ll let all of you know what we find.","Brian Meredith","Does the mobile app collect the same data that you collect with the dongles. Like I know there was like three or four things that you collected that kind of determine the rate or is there more stuff that you\u2019ll be collecting to determine the rate?","Tricia Griffith","It collects the same thing, the hard braking, the time of day, miles driven. And we do have and we put this in a while ago, we also collect and this is only for research and development at this point, we collect GPS.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks. Brian.","Julia Hornack","Thanks Marshall. We\u2019ll take the next question please.","Operator"," [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Gary Ransom","Good morning. I\u2019d like to ask about frequency. If I look back at all your frequency disclosures, you did see a little bit of a bump in frequency increases back in 2015 and maybe into early 2016, which seems to have at least leveled off or become more moderate. What are you thinking about frequency going forward? Are we at a new normal level, are you building in continued increase into your pricing? What do you see right now?","Tricia Griffith","Well, the last quarter, we actually saw a 4% decrease in frequency. And I - we\u2019re not going to react to one quarter because there\u2019s so many inputs that go into frequency, whether it\u2019s mix of business or macroeconomic data. On a trailing 12, we\u2019re about half a point [ph] out (42:16). And so we obviously collect things like miles driven, gas prices, macroeconomic data to understand long-term frequency trends. And we also internally create hypotheses to try to understand why our frequency goes up or down.","So just recently, with the downtick in frequency, we have couple of hypotheses that we\u2019re thinking about: one, we don\u2019t believe it actually is influenced by the weather. We do believe, as we bring on a more preferred mix of business that those customers will typically result in lower frequency.","We\u2019re also seeing higher miles driven with our UBI customers and a greater mix of trips that are longer trips that we define as over 15 miles. In addition to that, and the data is very thin, but it\u2019s interesting. We\u2019re seeing less hard brakes per participant. So our theory is that some of our UBI customers or our UBI customers in the aggregate are driving more highway longer trips, which could result in lower frequency versus a congestion in sort of the city.","Again, that\u2019s a hypothesis. We\u2019ll continue to gather data on that. Obviously, the last several years with our products, models, we have a much more enhanced segmentation and with our underwriting as well, and we believe that allows us to put business on the book that aligns with our ability to reach our profit goal. So we have some facts about frequency and some series and hypotheses that we\u2019ll continue to watch the data. Again, frequency, we can react to it, I don\u2019t want to predict it because there are so many things that can come into play at any given time.","Gary Ransom","Okay, well, that\u2019s helpful. Another question on the catastrophe reinsurance, the stop-loss. Is the way the accounting works, I just want to be sure I have it right, that as long as you\u2019re in this band and barring all the things that are not included, the name storms liability. The loss ratio will basically be 63 or thereabout until as long as you\u2019re inside the band of coverage, is that true for every month going forward?","Tricia Griffith","Correct. I think, yeah, on a calendar year.","Gary Ransom","Okay. And then on last year\u2019s [indiscernible] (44:46), some of the press is saying that all the $35 million has been returned and I wondered - and yet those losses have developed beyond that. I wondered if you could give us any insight as to what was going on there.","Tricia Griffith","Yeah, I\u2019ll let Trevor take that one.","Trevor Hillier","Yeah, all $35 million hasn\u2019t been collected yet, but we have let investors know that the loss is above that number. It\u2019s slightly above that number. Really the development is we\u2019re seeing a lot more late reports than we had seen in our previous history and continue to see them and which has caused a little bit of adverse development there, but it\u2019s not a turnover, the $35 million.","Gary Ransom","Is that - does the fact that that can happen or you may not actually collect as much as you\u2019re supposedly due, does that make you shy away from cat bonds at all in the future?","A - Trevor Hillier No, no, not at all. It was just - we had adverse development that we weren\u2019t entirely expecting. So it\u2019s not anything in the mechanics of the cat bond, it was just we had development that we didn\u2019t originally expect.","Gary Ransom","Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks Gary.","Julia Hornack","All right. We will take the next call, please.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Amit Kumar of McMurray. Your line is open.","Amit Kumar","Hi, thanks and good morning and thanks for putting me in. Two, again, two quick follow-ups. So one is going back to Meyer\u2019s question on new cars and used cars declining, if I were to ask this another way, has the average age of the automobile you ensure, has that changed over, let\u2019s say, the 5 years or has it remained somewhat static at, let\u2019s say, 11 or 12 years of age?","Tricia Griffith","I would say not much. We look at our fleet every year and I would say it has not changed dramatically.","Amit Kumar","And is that number like 11, 12 or is that different from that?","Tricia Griffith","I\u2019m sorry?","Amit Kumar","Is that the number the average age is 11 years or something like that?","Tricia Griffith","It\u2019s like 11.5. Yeah.","Amit Kumar","Okay, got it. The other question, going back to the discussion on the mobile app, in the letter, you talked about the penetration, I think it\u2019s in four states right now. Have you talked about some sort of timeline as to how we should think about the expansion and is this sort of concurrent with the dongle or does it at some point replace the dongle? That timeline would be very helpful. Thanks.","Tricia Griffith","This is for - these are for new business. And so we\u2019ve rolled out four states in December. We rolled out 22 states today. So we\u2019re in 27 states and we intend to roll out the mobile device for new business throughout the country in 2017. So pretty aggressive timeline for that. We - our customers that have the dongle, we recycle those fairly quickly, so at some point, the majority of our customers will have mobile or we will have had the information on their loss characteristics or the driving characteristics, I should say, from the Snapshot device.","Trevor Hillier","And just to be clear, today, the mobile device is an option for consumers, they can also opt into the dongle, but additionally, in the future, we would expect more and more of this data to come directly from the vehicles. And as you noted, our October presentation, we talked about an effort with GM and vehicles - GM vehicles I believe model year 2016 and newer have the ability to send the data that we collect similar to the data we collect with the dongle or the mobile device to us directly from the vehicle.","So we have been running a pilot whereby GM customers opt into sharing their data with us, and we calculate a rate based on the data they share with us, and then we\u2019ll sell them a new policy with that discount incorporated at inception. It\u2019s been in pilot mode, and actually this month, we\u2019ll sort of flip over to more active mode. So we think the volume in that area is going to increase, albeit it\u2019s just vehicles, 2016 or newer, but the longer term model there, we see migrating actually to vehicles delivering the data.","Amit Kumar","Yeah, that is very helpful. If I could just sneak a follow-up to that. Do you have plans to talk to other auto manufacturers or are you in advanced stages in terms of rolling out this sort of pilot program with them too or is this an one-off thing? Thanks.","Tricia Griffith","We\u2019re always interested in talking to the OEs about opportunities that we wouldn\u2019t be able to talk about any that would be in place. But yeah, we\u2019re always interested in learning more and being a part of advancing what we think is really a great pricing algorithm in a variable floor pricing. So, yeah.","Amit Kumar","I will stop here. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.","Tricia Griffith","Gary, I had one correction. I said calendar year 63 for the aggregate stop-loss, I meant to say accident year.","Julia Hornack","And we actually have no other questions at this time. So that concludes our call. I\u2019ll turn it back over to you Marcia, for the closing script.","Operator","That concludes the Progressive Corporation\u2019s Investor Relations Conference Call.

These documents can found via the Investors page of our website progressive.com.","We are now ready to take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Amit Kumar from Macquarie.","Amit Kumar","My first question relates to obviously the focus on miles driven and the lost coast trends we're seeing. We are getting a lot of incoming questions from investors that, it's only a matter of time before these frequency trends surface at Progressive too. Can you talk about why we are not seeing these trends at Progressive and maybe loop that in with the discussion on the risks occurred as to where you write business?","Glenn Renwick","Sure. I suspect you're more than referencing a few data points that have come out with regard to frequency?","Amit Kumar","Yes.","Glenn Renwick","Let me just start by saying no matter what frequencies are reported, they're all samples from an overall population. And even if we do frequency by channel, we're going to have slightly different numbers. I think what you're more likely focused on is what would be a fairly dramatic difference let's suggest, with Allstate having reported recently and Progressive. I'm not going to even attempt to try to explain those differences but let me give you a fair amount of color as to where I see things going. We spend a reasonable amount of time looking at our frequency and severity. But I'll focus just on frequency for now because I think that's the guts of your question. Relative to PCI data, and while we don't lay on top of PCI directly, and right now a little more favorable i.e., our frequency is a little lower, we are a lot more comparable to the PCI data than we were for example, Allstate. That can happen. You sample any population, you're going to have different outcomes. So it's not a question of what's right and wrong, but starting to explain mix differences and mix differences can occur through urban concentrations, rural concentrations, different states. So recognize all of these data points really need to be broken down.","You referenced miles driven. One of the advantages that Progressive has suggested to investors before, is that we have an early look system at miles driven. Again, it's a sample of a very large population but with our Snapshot population being sizable, we're very comfortable that we are actually getting sort of on a daily, weekly, whatever we choose to examine basis, any real detection of miles driven changes. I'm not going to become a free data source and give you the specifics. But, I will tell you in July there was an uptick in miles driven. We had seen an uptick all year, but it had been reasonably constant and then in July, on a July over July basis, it was more significant uptick.","Again, what's more important there is, what kind of miles are being driven and we're analyzing that from a point of view. So I'll just give you one break that we use and that is miles - or trips, single continuous trips over 15 miles. We are actually seeing that become a higher percentage of miles driven. So again, frequency will track with the type of miles and we're seeing longer trips and there's a different frequency for longer trips then there are for shorter trips. We simply are observing our frequencies, we report them as they are.","Obviously, very favorable right now. I don't know that you should assume that Progressive is anything other than a large player. So our frequencies may be reflective of the environment. They may change. Whenever we see another data point that's inconsistent with our own, clearly, it puts our attention to make sure that we're not perhaps overlooking a future trend to the data point.","Clearly what we measure is what we measure. The real issue is, which direction is it going? So we are seeing miles driven up. We are seeing a certain type of miles driven up, we believe that that could result in higher frequencies, but so far, we are not betting on a dramatic change in the frequencies and we're very comfortable with what we have.","All of that, should be translated into pricing. It's really not a matter of what the frequency is, it's whether or not you're priced for that frequency and priced for that severity. And right now, we're very comfortable that we've actually previously seen opportunities to take our rates up, believing that frequencies would rise. And, we're in a very comfortable position as we see it right now. We have mechanisms inside of our rates, whereby we keep those rates moving up a small amount. And hopefully, we will match frequency and severity for a period of time when we simply get out of match, that's when we take more dramatic or quantum rate changes 1%, 2%, whatever is necessary. Did that get at your question?","Amit Kumar","Yes, that is actually very helpful. The only follow-up I have is, we've talked about Snapshot and you talked about the insight it gives you. 2.5 million I guess is the ballpark number of Snapshot customers. When you talk about insight, how should we think about what is the percent of that book which is transmitting real-time data back to you?","Glenn Renwick","That's a fair question and I don't have a particularly good answer for you. So that is the size of the book but not all those customers have an active chip. Because once they've actually gone through the first six months, we will actually have been them give the chip back and we will recycle it. While you can always make the assessment that more data is better, there is also a cost to more data so it's really a question of the marginal costs versus the marginal return of new information. But, we are looking at something in the order of one million trips a day. So think about it as, not so much how many vehicles but what we are really getting from it. Cumulatively, we're well over 13 or probably approaching 15 billion miles driven and one million trips a day is a big number relative to sample statistics. So we're very comfortable that we've got that inside look and while it may not have been the primary driving force behind Snapshot, clearly it wasn't, it's an awfully good side effect.","Operator","Your next question or comment Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi","Thank you. Just following up on Amit's question there. I guess, the one question I have is, you have two, both you and Allstate, and I'm not asking to comment on their trend. But you have two carriers that are big that write across the spectrum and probably have some overlap in demographic. You almost have two - with miles driven rising, I understand your comment on PCI, but we literally have two endpoints in terms of experience. With a large pool, I'm just trying to - it doesn't seem intuitive to me that we could be seeing two dramatically different experiences. And I get your point on rate, but rate is a top line - I'm sorry rate is more of a function of top line, whereas frequency should be more margin related. Is there anything that we just not being operators, is there something else that could explain two really, really large populations with vastly different experience?","Glenn Renwick","It's a very fair question, Michael, and I'm not in a position to try and even explain someone else's issues other than the fact that the good news is, we all measure frequency. It's not a make-believe number, so for the most part, we can assume that both numbers are right. Why they are so disparate from the same population, I don't have a great answer for you. I certainly can give you lots of pieces why they will never be the same. In 30 years of being in the business, I often have trouble reconciling between channels and other carriers. But this is a pretty big difference and I have not seen that on very many occasions. So I don't have a good explanation.","If I had to speculate, I would say mix is probably a good chunk of that. I mentioned the urban and rural kind of environment. I don't have the ability, I don't think anyone does, to be able to dissect the mix of the business to see if it could be an explanatory variable. That one's a tough one. I think the key thing for us, and maybe this is just part of my nature, is I get more paranoid when things are going well. So you can be sure that if someone else is seeing something, we'll be looking. But it's not something that we're worried about missing. We know how many claims are coming in on a daily basis, we know how to count those claims, and if we see any sort of upticks, you can be sure we'll be adjusting for it.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. I'm sorry?","Glenn Renwick","And we're not seeing that right now.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. I guess, just switching on the homeowners side. Can you talk about, you mentioned some points in your letter but as you're getting agents on board, can you talk about what that entails in terms of expenses, commission differences and also, just the information and education to get agents to understand the differentiated nature of this offering? Not just verses what you were offering before or what others offer but just from the fact that you're moving placement from being just a more of a pure auto writer to now a bundled provider and looking to be in that space. Thanks.","Glenn Renwick","Good. I'm glad you picked up on that because platinum, think about our relationship with ASI in its current form of being one quarter in and we've gotten within that first 90 days, we're out in the marketplace with a product that basically is just us. Not one or the other or two together. It's us together. Which I find to be the most exciting thing that we've done in a long time. And I said in there it will be a limited distribution. I will come back and comment on that.","You talked about costs and startup. There will definitely be some startup costs but most of those will be just a reallocation of costs that we have in the marketplace. So we're not necessarily hiring new people or so on and so forth. There'll be some incremental costs but probably not ones that will flow through to any degree that you would see them.","On the other hand, the commission costs, we absolutely are prepared to pay more commission and will do so, for these platinum agents if they provide us with the exact intent, the bundled product that we are looking for. So that should reflect, it will be a little hard to see. I will be more than willing to take those sort of questions after another quarter, six months. But you may have trouble seeing that flow through in the expense ratio because it will be relatively small.","Why are we doing limited distribution? Frankly, we really want to get at a class, and I tried to note this a little bit in my letter, a class of customer that for the most part, and I'll separate here just, not very often, but I will for now, Progressive and ASI. The more preferred customer that while we've always wanted them, we've always had a product, has not been the sweet spot for us in the agency channel. And this gives us an opportunity to literally get a data set of those customers and understand if there is truly a different pure premium that they represent versus perhaps a more mass distributed product.","And obviously, we're making a very, we think an intelligent and informed but, to be fair, imperfect at this point in time, determination that that pure premium will be lower and support a higher commission. And as we get more of that data, which we're excited to start having come in, we will be able to A, confirm that, or, as I hope is possible, recognize that there's possibly even more there as we address this pure premium segment that we really haven't seen before of both bundled and a class of customers that a group of agents have access to that we previously have not captured.","So a little bit up on commission costs but that will probably be very small in the aggregate. But to help you with that, I'm more than willing to give you some data on that as we have future calls like this. Our internal expenses, while we are allocating sales, resources and rolled out expenses, I wouldn't worry about that too much.","Operator","Your next question or comment Jay Gelb from Barclays.","Jay Gelb","Thanks and good morning. With Allstate saying it's going to put back on expenses which includes advertising, my sense is that could result in a slower growth rate in policies in force for auto insurance for Allstate. Does that offer an opportunity for Progressive to expand its growth across the auto product overall and the direct channel in particular?","Glenn Renwick","The answer to that has to be, yes. We hope that we're a recipient of that and if you think about the definitive new business that we get when people switch, we're obviously one of those considerations. So calibrating that, the good news is we report monthly, you'll get to see. And over time we will - we will, certainly, internally, look at the percentage of new business that had come in with proof of prior from Allstate and so on and so forth. But we do that as a natural course of business anyway.","We have seen, starting at about May, John, correct me if I'm wrong there, that the paid search from Allstate and even Esurance to a degree, they've actually gone down pretty significantly. We track those sort of things. So the comments of pulling back on advertising, certainly we've seen that in the paid search area which is the easiest one for us to get a clean handle on which is great from our perspective. Obviously, we're not doing that. In fact, our ad spend has been strengthened just a little bit. So this is a time where as long as we are very comfortable with our rate level, we've talked about some of the macro trends of miles driven, frequency, these are all of the things that we spend - that's basically what we do. We spend our time trying to make sure we've got those in balance. As long as we think we've got them in balance, this is actually a good time for us.","But, I would also tell you, building on my prior comment of being paranoid, when you grow fast, the book changes. And while we're big and no matter how much new business, it doesn't change dramatically. We've got to be very conscience of new business effects. To the extent that new business comes in with prior insurance, that is actually better for us then those that have no prior insurance. Is it an opportunity? Absolutely. But we've got to make sure that we do our job and not worry too much about what others are doing. And right now, we're positioned in a really nice way. So I feel great about the marketplace, I feel great about our pricing and we'll take it when it's there.","Operator","Your next question or comment Ian Gutterman from Balyasny.","Ian Gutterman","Glenn, I just wanted to go into a little bit of the first half results and understand what's happening on the loss side a little bit. When I look at accidents in the year loss ratio, so I strip out the cats, I strip out the development. In the first quarter, you were up about 3 points year-over-year, and in second quarter, 2 points but then if I back out, my best guess with the mix of home, it was also close to about 3 points. So why do we see the accident year go up 3 points if loss trends have been reasonably within expectations?","Glenn Renwick","Those numbers seem right to me. But we are priced to a level. Recognize that we're also at a point where accident year results would be comfortable. There's no question the calendar year results are better than the accident year results. We fully - that's why we publish so that you can actually get to those things right now given what we've just talked about, market conditions, our ability to attract new business. I am perfectly happy to be close to our target combined ratio when I can get a disproportionate growth to go along with that. So you're right, but I'm not concerned about that and I think we're priced to the right pure premium trends.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. I guess I was looking to -","John Sauerland","I'm sorry this is John. I would add that yes, prior year development has been favorable. The good news there is, we've talked a lot about frequency on this call but our severity trends have been good as well. Severity has come in below what we projected and obviously reserve for and that allows us to show the favorable prior year development. The other component that I think you need to think about when you look at that total, is the expense ratio. So we target a budgetary loss ratio that is driven by our expense ratio and we've been able to drive that down some. I think about maybe about 0.5 point there. So you're just looking at the loss ratio. Combined ratio, obviously, calendar year-over-year is down a bit. Exit the year, yes, up a bit, but very confident, as Glenn said, that we are pricing to our targets and are a good place rate level wise.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. Because I guess what surprised me a little bit, John, was I thought normally, I'd have to go double check this, but I thought normally we would see in a period of a lot of releases and especially when those releases are coming from the most recent accident year, releases would be driven by severity coming in better than expected. And if that was the case, that would probably help your picks for the current year, right? So just seems odd to me that the picks are going up at the same time development is getting better. I would have thought those would go in the same direction?","John Sauerland","I don't - I'm not sure I understand what you mean by picks are going up?","Ian Gutterman","I guess what I'm saying just again, if you look at your overall 2015 loss ratios, you're basically flat year-over-year. But developments helped about 3 points - it changed. Development's been about a 3 point help year to date. So on an accident year basis, you've deteriorated by that amount year to date. So it seems like the 2015 accident year is being reserved to a higher loss ratio than the 2014 accident year. And the reason the calendar year's the same is because the reserve at least is from 2014.","John Sauerland","The prior year development is actually a little less than 2 points to start with. So I'm not sure where the 3 is coming from?","Ian Gutterman","I was doing the delta in it. That's okay. I'll move on I guess. The other thing Glenn, just -","Glenn Renwick","Let me just make a point here and I'm not sure I'm directly on your question. But, historically, we will react very quickly to trends because the penalty for not doing so is severe. Occasionally, we get out ahead of trend and it doesn't materialize or competitors don't necessarily take the rate increase. Our - if you want to put it in the highest terms, our penalty function for being out in front of trends that maybe doesn't materialize, is wider margins. Here we think we've actually got our pricing very close to what our run rate accident year would need to be","So, to me, I don't think about a deterioration in loss ratio as necessarily a positive or a negative. I'm much more focused on the target that we're trying to achieve under the different market conditions. So, if we get out ahead, and we've done that, we actually end up with wider margins. This is a time I don't think we're out ahead, I think we can bring in a good volume of new business at and our renewals with it, at our objective targets. So that deterioration seems like a negative. I would caution at least for me, to say we're moving towards our more optimal ordered peer of pricing target for profitability and the ability to grow as fast as possible which is exactly what we say is our primary objective.","Ian Gutterman","That make sense. Just real quick, on the - I guess this is as much a severity question as frequency. But I believe the National Highway data showed an increase in vehicular deaths this year and talking to some of the life insurance companies who have seen some adverse mortality, they've discussed an increase in auto related deaths. Have you seen that pickup and has that been an impact on severity at all?","Glenn Renwick","You know what, I'm not really able to be informative on that one. You're probably right on all points but I don't have that information. I would just be speculating and I don't like to do that.","Operator","Your next question or comment Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome","Sorry to beat a dead horse here, could we talk a little bit about the favorable reserve development and the components thereof in the first half of the year? They do seem a little bit larger than what you have historically had. And, if I recall, you folks are one of the better ones at trying to actually get dead on over time. Is there changes in the reserving philosophy? Is there anything particular that's driving a little bit of an increase in the favorable development?","Glenn Renwick","Why don't you take that with certainly the philosophy is no change and then we've got Gary, our Chief Actuary with us. Let's let John take that and Gary come in.","John Sauerland","Sure. We have been quite accurate over the past several years when it comes to reserving and it is always our objective of being as close as possible. So there's been absolutely no change in reserving philosophy. The year-to-date experience has simply been that severity, especially for BI, has come in materially lower than we expect. If you look at a long-term trend line of BI severity, it's very positive. So I think 3 or 4 points a year, we are down below that right now and we think that is due to some improvements in our claims handling. We think it's a good problem to have. This doesn't mean that we'll dial everything down quickly to the new experience, but Gary is certainly watching that closely and will adjust as appropriate. We're seeing the improvement across business lines so that's another indication that there may be a handling improvement that we are seeing within our claims organization because their claims organization handles all lines within the same order. So we feel great about the BI severity trends we've seen and we'll take the adjustments as we see fit. On the property side, we have taken some adjustments there as well. It's been a little more in terms of percentage of losses then on the vehicle side. We're just beginning to really ensure the process around those reserves and Gary is getting very engaged with folks who run ASI to ensure we have similarly design processes around the ASI reserves. Anything you want to add to that, Gary?","Gary Traicoff","I think that's a very good answer by John. The only thing I would add to that is geographically, the development we're seeing is fairly consistent across most states as well. It's not just a few states driving the development that you are seeing and the improvement in the loss costs.","Glenn Renwick","And Gary, why don't you do the split commercial personal auto?","Gary Traicoff","And respect to commercial versus personal auto, we are seeing fairly favorable development in both of those sides. On the commercial side, the development is more so in our business auto and contractors business and that's making up roughly about $40 million or so the development that you are seeing this year.","Paul Newsome","Do you anticipate that as the property comes on that we'll see a little bit different reserve pattern over time? My sense is that it's a little bit easier to be dead on, on auto book than it is on a home book. Maybe I'm wrong with that.","John Sauerland","I think it's a little early for us to project what we'll see there down the road. I think it's a little early to answer that in our case.","Glenn Renwick","Yes, keep asking it, Paul. But our overall philosophy will be pretty much as you've known it for an awful long time. We're not interested in worrying about what this report in a calendar year. We live accident year and just ASI. So we will always attempt to get that right because that's pricing in the marketplace and we know we have to price to.","Paul Newsome","And just one quick one if I can squeeze it in that has nothing to do with the reserves. On the new product, platinum, that increase in commission, is that a straight commission increase or is that related to a contingent commission?","Glenn Renwick","There's components of both. Components of both, so agents should see this as quite favorable. So, we're - I'll just hit some top line issues when looking at all the details but if I'm an agent producing, I will absolutely get an immediate recognition of more commission. Certainly from the Progressive side, it will be additive to what I would have otherwise got. Then, there is a level at which you can attain different compensation overrides later, based on certain levels of production. And, while I know that, I couldn't explain them all to you right this second. We're very comfortable that that level of commission puts us in a competitor situation, not necessarily overly competitive, but agents certainly will not be able to say, gee, I would love to use you but your commission isn't quite there what I might get from another carrier. It's in that ballpark and those that actually use us very well, can even expect more than that. We've made what I would call, not a concession, just a marketing approach. It will be a very small percentage of our policies in force but we've also tried to coordinate policy periods so that those who are truly committed to that destination type of situation that we've been talking to you about, can have an annual policy and a home policy with comparent or simultaneous renewal dates.","Those sorts of things are changes. We know the pluses and minuses of doing those sorts of things but they've been very well received by agents so far. I can't give you a great deal of insight as to platinum's receptivity. We'll be in the market in Texas about 40 days as of the end of the quarter. Indiana I think snuck in just in the quarter, if I remember correctly. I don't know if we wrote a policy in the quarter, but we are in there and will continue to roll that out. I will tell you that the initial receptivity from sales folks, now sales folks tend to have a way of being more excited than sometimes I am, is very, very positive. So I'd be disappointed if that wasn't the case. But I can't give you a really good feel right now about incremental volume over the offerings that the agent already had. We are certainly of the belief that is incremental. We just don't have a good sizing on that that would feel comfortable giving to you at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question or comment Meyer Shields from KBW","Meyer Shields","Thanks, good morning. This is going to be a little bit long but we are seeing an increase in average commercial policy size despite the fact that the results are phenomenal. So I'm assuming that's mix shift. First, is that true? And second, if it is, does it drive your combined ratio closer to 96 faster than it would've been if you just allow trends to erode the excess profits embedded in rates?","Glenn Renwick","Only in a friendly way, Meyer. There is no such thing as excess profits. There is absolutely some to that. Our commercial business in general, and we gave you this in the Q, is average premiums are actually up period across the board. Is that on all segments? Yes, but is it more dramatic in some segments? Also, yes. So the mix shift towards for higher business, transportation and specialty lines, with the higher average premiums, absolutely that's part of it. The second part of the question, was should we expect erosion on the combined ratio because of that? The answer is, not by design in any way shape or form. We try to price all pieces of our business, we call them CMT, doesn't really matter just market tiers, commercial market tiers. So we are looking for the same kind of margin in each segment. Why we have been able to get rate and have a good loss results is in large part reflective of the market really hardened in those segments and there are less availability of carriers that we're benefiting from that. We are happy to do that. We don't think that will last forever.","And you also use 96 in some cases. We don't price every segment through a 96. Our clear explanation in the annual report is all - the amalgam of all of our products comes to a 96. So in places where we believe there are higher risks, and there are higher risks in commercial simply because you have lower unit numbers and lower losses to deal with. So our, what we will call indications, always have a little bit more volatility to them, so we include volatility in part of our targets. A lot in there but no, you shouldn't assume that because we have a slight mix change to the all higher segments, which is driving average premium, that necessarily that should drive the lost costs. We price each piece to be consistent with our targets.","John Sauerland","I might add to that, that in the Q we did tell you [indiscernible] business for commercial average premium there is up 20% to 25%. So that clearly is indicative of the shift that Glenn mentioned. We look very closely at the profitability by new business and by renewal business and by the marketing tiers that Glenn mentioned. And we not only feel great about our profitability and aggregate, we feel great about new and renewal by all of those marketing tiers. We're watching that pretty closely and it is shifting for sure, but we're feeling pretty good about what's going on.","Glenn Renwick","Just two other segments that we'll just comment on is that more recent, or let's just say later in the quarter, we started to see a little bit more active growth in our business auto which is the higher number of units but lower average premium business. So we're starting to see some growth in that. The first growth really came in the four higher segments.","Not yet at all confirmed, but we're starting to see an uptick in the contractor business. And that may be a little bit more reflective of some declines and now just a little bit more recovery in the economy. But at least we're starting to see the early signs, don't think we'll be able to comment with any veracity until at least another quarter, but we're starting to see some early signs. So the incoming quoting mix changed but it's also starting to change again and for us, that's a very good thing. A good balance book is great.","Meyer Shields","Okay, that was very thorough. Thank you. I understand that you don't report comprehensive loss cost trends because there's a lot of volatility there related to the weather. But if you look other components of it, and I'm thinking here specifically of theft. Is there any sort of macroeconomic trend? I don't know if people are doing better economically. Is there a reduction in theft or anything like that?","Glenn Renwick","Good question. I see Gary scrambling for some notes here. I don't have an answer for you but he may.","Gary Traicoff","What I have in front of me, is in terms of total comprehensive trends and this would be excluding cat information. What we are seeing, severity is running around 3% to 4%, frequency is relatively flat. I don't have the theft broken out right now but that's easy enough to get if we want to get that information.","John Sauerland","Gary was quoting the most recent quarter numbers there.","Gary Traicoff","Correct.","Glenn Renwick","Hopefully the long-term trend on that will be very favorable and I mean long-term trend. But pretty soon, cars will be able to tell you exactly where they are, so hopefully we'll lose less of them or the criminals might get smarter. I don't know.","Operator","Your next question or comment Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. First question, can you give us an update on the success you're having or traction with the new Snapshot product in the agency segment?","Glenn Renwick","Sure. Snapshot continues to be a big exciting venture for us. Probably the biggest things we've done, we gave you an update at the IR meeting. What brought it into the marketplace, the terminology internally we use is 3.0. Don't worry too much about that. And we put it in concert with the most recent overall personal lines product design and that's out now five to six states something like that. In the four states that I have received data on and looked at, here are a couple of the points that are notable. The increase in usage of Snapshot by the agents has gone up fairly significantly but still at a low level. That's important. Absolutely, we achieved something that we were setting out to achieve. Did we get to a level that we would say approximates the direct? No. So think of that as more in the 10% range in terms of usage by agents. Whereas, with regard to direct, think about it a little bit more in the 30% to 40% range. We're not going to give absolute estimates on that but I'll give you those ranges and you can assume that they are very accurate.","One of the things that is important to us in Snapshot is that if you take the customers that specifically are now indirect, that are using a multi-product quoting mechanism, actually the numbers are considerably higher. So those who intend to buy multi-product from us, are quoting and buying at rates closer to 45%, 50% using Snapshot. So we're actually very excited about that. A term that we may have used in the discussions in May is sort of the future Robinsons. Obviously, we use Robinsons but the future Robinsons, those Diane's that are transitioning. That group is showing a high propensity to consider Snapshot. So when I say Diane's it could be with a renters product, it could be those that have become just early Robinsons. It's filling a niche that's very useful to us and when you start getting into those numbers, while we can continue to say there are parts of the population that are just still saying no, I don't want that level of intrusion in my vehicle, whatever their reasons are for that. So we're not expecting 100% by any stretch of the imagination. But it's a pretty good part of the marketplace that we actually want and expect to be a big part of our destination era.","There are those that are buying more traditionally nonstandard, which we clearly continue to want to offer. They're not always interested in having quite that level of active involvement in their insurance and they may or may not keep it very long. But those that we want to be with us at the best rates are actually showing very high take rates.","So comfortable with that, I gave you some information on the mileage driven. In terms of our discounts, we're comfortable that at renewal we're seeing something around 60% plus of people actually getting their renewal quote which gives them at least the discounts we advance to them at point-of-sale. Now there's still another percentage they're actually getting a discount but maybe not quite as much as we advanced at the point-of-sale. So that general 70\/30 we've shown you in the past, is suggesting that there is still sort of 70%-ish, possibly a little more, little less depending on the state, that are benefiting from the Snapshot. So the greater good theory here is clearly working in our favor. There are a percent of those that are not exposed to a significant increase. And then, frankly there are those that use a disproportionate amount of the loss costs and we are applying a surcharge with this new model and we recognize that that will be, for those individuals either a non-renewal or reluctant renewal, whatever that might be. However, as long as the numbers are as favorable as we see them, we're comfortable that we've got a good design out in the marketplace that can sustain and match loss costs better with the individual.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you. And then, next question just curious. I see that you added two new states in agency segment for the PHA program. How is that going to play off against the platinum product? Is there going to be both PHA and platinum in states? Certain agents gets one then the other? How is that going to work going forward?","Glenn Renwick","You got it. That's essentially how it's going to work. There are agents that are very happy to have ASI home and Progressive. But I'm not necessarily the agent that says, this is a must have. I'm going to build around this and put it as one of my primary providers. But those who are willing to make that commitment, we are willing to commit more and that's what the platinum program is all about. And I will tell you, that the interest from agents is meeting expectations at that level. Now I'm doing a personal commercial. But, frankly, I wouldn't take the bet against a combination of ASI and Progressive for the future. What we can do when we get the data together, I think we can really provide agents a serious, serious product for their bundled higher end customers. And I think many are accepting that.","John Sauerland","I'd add onto that commercial and say, the first step is the renters for a lot of households. And, in the states in which we've rolled our renters so far, we appoint 75% to 80%-ish of our agents with the renters program. So they can bundle auto and renters. We get better retention when we have that package. We have a far greater likelihood of graduating them to the home and auto package as well. Obviously, that's with a little tighter distribution with PHA. And then, yes, the pinnacle or platinum set agents is an even tighter distribution.","Julia Hornack","This is Julia. Thank you so much for everybody's questions today. We have great participation and quite a few people still in queue and we're running out of time. So I'd just like to encourage people to limit their questions to one question and one follow-up please. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question or comment Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just a couple quick ones I think. Hopefully quick ones on the property business with ARX. I would say during the quarter, net written premiums grew a little more than we would have expected. I'm wondering if there's any portion of that that we can attribute to higher retention or different reinsurance buying or anything along those lines?","Glenn Renwick","No. Why don't we try to give you a little bit of insight to those numbers. I know they're confusing in some parts. There will be some changes in the way we address direct written premium with the reinsurance accounting and so on and so forth. Bottom line is, ARX's first quarter and second quarter were not dramatically different. While we didn't have ownership at the levels we have and consolidated reporting, so we haven't given you that. But if you really want to look, you can find the statutory numbers out there. And I'd tell you the second quarter is roughly the same as the first. But nothing in this league of dramatic that is worth reporting or dramatic change in retention. Frankly, in the 90 days, while we are extremely happy with everything that's going on, there is nothing dramatic to report.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. And then I guess just on the expense ratio ex the -","John Sauerland","I would just reiterate what Glenn said, we had a change in the way we account for a reinsurance obligations that take place normally around June and December each year. That net written premium may not be wholly indicative of the growth rate. The direct written premium will be much more indicative of the actual growth rate. So I would focus on that number. We can't obviously report prior year because we didn't have the ownership stake. So we can't give you apples to apples right now. Their second quarter statutory data will come out fairly soon and you'll be able to see the direct written premium growth in those statements.","I also add though, that while growth in homeowners is great, the more important growth is growth in bundles. So that was the intent of the transaction and come together far more closely than it previously did. And that's where we're going to get the biggest benefit. If we could overnight bundle the entire ARX book with auto, we'd be way happier than growing the homeowner piece. So just want to reiterate that's the intent of what we're trying to do there.","Glenn Renwick","And closely coupled with that, when we talk bundled, you should think policy life expectancy and amortization of fixed expenses and the like and improvement typically in loss costs. So those are the things that really are, as I think I wrote once before, the currency of this transaction.","Ryan Tunis","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just on the expense ratio. Again, trying to reconcile that ARX to some of the stat data we seen. I thin ex amortization costs, so the low 30s? I mean is that a good run rate to use going forward, or is there anything we should be thinking about there in terms of a drop off in expenses or anything of the like?","John Sauerland","I would make two comments on that. We do have Trevor Hillier, the CFO of ASI here with us. First, I want to clarify a comment I made earlier in the call talking about our expense ratio being down 0.5 point. That is on the vehicle side of personal lines side. You add in the ARX expense ratio and look at our total, we're flatter. But the ASI expense ratio net of amortization expenses, is more in the low 20s. I think 24-ish. Correct me if I'm wrong on that. Trevor?","Trevor Hillier","That's correct. It's between 23% and 24%. We've held that for a few periods. I think one thing you mentioned was comparing our statutory numbers with the numbers reported in the Progressive numbers. Is that correct?","Ryan Tunis","I did, yes.","Trevor Hillier","The difference there is mainly with our consolidated group that's reported with Progressive includes our managing general agents which is not included in the statutory results. The statutory results are just insurance companies. So, it won't reconcile one to one.","Operator","Your next question or comment Todd Bault with Citi.","Todd Bault","Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a variant question on something you raised earlier about high growth rates could change nicks. For what it's worth, our research has shown that over the last few years, you've done a pretty good job of your pricing and loss trend tracking each other. Within a couple of points of course. Who knows if that's correct. But, knowing what you know about your pricing and monitoring systems, if you went through a period where your pricing was more or less tracking your loss trends, would that have an ancillary effect of maintaining your portfolio homogeneity? In other words, your risks would be more or less as you expect it. Or those played independent. In other words, could you have pricing track loss trend well but you could still have pretty large shifts in homogeneity. And that's all I have. Thanks.","Glenn Renwick","No I think that our intent is to always have pricing track out losses and to the extent that a new inflow of business changes the homogeneity of the book in place, it's always easier to manage a static book. It's not much fun, but it's easier. The real question is, is the new incoming mix equivalent to, similar to, different than, what you currently have? And we don't expect that to necessarily be the case. In fact, and this is conjecture, so not a statement of fact. Everything we are doing and seeing and I've reported several of the trends today, Snapshot usage, how that's trending to multi-product customers, the notion of platinum, we have every reason to believe the mix of business coming in may be more preferred overall than what we've seen before. So that would be positive. And then, your pricing unlikely to have any great effect, but should be positive to the loss costs.","Operator","Your next question or comment Al Copersino with Columbia Management.","Al Copersino","Thank you very much. I wanted to go back to a couple earlier questions just because I personally was a bit confused and that's probably my own fault. In response to questions from Ian, you all spoke about the importance of looking at the overall calendar year combined ratio. In response to questions from Meyer, I believe you said that your focus is on the accident year more so than the calendar year. And so, number one, I want to make sure I understood that right and maybe there are two separate issues being discussed.","And then the second verily in part of that was, it does appear, as Ian was saying, that the reserve for leases remain strong but the underlying loss ratio continues to be higher. I don't know if that should be cause for concern or if that should be cause for future optimism. That the reserve releases may in fact be a leading indicator of an eventual improvement in the underlying loss ratio. I wonder if you could respond to those two issues?","Glenn Renwick","I will try. I don't remember the specific reference to calendar but that may be me. Let me just suggest to you, as far as I'm concerned, we think in terms of accident year most of the time. Calendar year is just an adjustment for the quality defects and reserving in a previous period. So accident year, for me, is almost exclusively the way we like to look at the business. Clearly, we all understand that those adjustments are made from an accounting perspective. But accident year is probably a better way to look at the economics verses the accounting.","I thought I'd try to get at this with Ian's question, maybe I wasn't clear. Degradation in the loss ratio under certain circumstances might be a really bad situation. If on the other hand, the loss ratio was lower than your previously designed target, then it might be perfectly acceptable to move toward your target. Clearly not acceptable to go beyond your target. If and when market conditions are such that you're willing to give up a point of loss ratio and get what you consider to be proportionate volume or the elasticity of the market is willing to give it to you, then those are trade outs that not only do we make, it's sort of the heart and soul of what we say is the guiding principles of Progressive. And that is, we attempt to make a 4% underwriting profit. If and when we do, we try to go as fast as possible. And it's very much that sequence and we are quite comfortable right now seeing that the market will give us some growth and we want to be priced as close to our target as we can. So, hopefully that clarifies it. But think accident year is by far more of the economics of the Company, the calendar year is the accounting.","Operator","Your next question or comment Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Thank you for getting me in at the end. I appreciate always all the tools you give us to analyze things. And I asked this question on the Allstate conference call but not sure that I'm any smarter. Can you tell me the difference between paid frequency trends and incurred frequency trends? And to the extent is incurred frequency generally a more leading indicator?","Glenn Renwick","I'm actually probably going to ask Gary to determine that. I will tell you that from my perspective, I spend most of my time on incurred. Paid may or may not be an indicator not necessarily one way or another, sort of which way ultimately your prior trend pricks might be adjusted. But Gary spends more of his time on this. If I were you, I would focus more on incurred frequency.","Gary Traicoff","This is Gary Traicoff, Chief Actuary. I think just to add to Glenn's point, we look at both. But I typically rely more on the incurred frequency as opposed to paid. A couple of the issues you could have with paid frequency is when you changes in closer rate for example, that could distort what you're paid frequency looks like. Whereas, the incurred frequency should be a lot more stable.","Josh Shanker","And when you spoke about July frequency being up, is that a spike relative to July 2014 or relative to June 2015?","John Sauerland","I think we should clarify the earlier comments. Glenn said, vehicle miles traveled are up in July. He didn't say frequency was up in July.","Josh Shanker","Good point.","John Sauerland","He also commented that the mix of types of trips has changed. So I think of it as gas prices have gotten more competitive, more people are taking vacations instead of staycations this summer. We did not say frequency is up in July, miles traveled is up and up more than it's been. I think we showed you back in May, it's been up for a number of months now and July took a little further tick up.","Operator","Your next question or comment Vinay Misquith with Sterne Agee.","Vinay Misquith","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on one thing, the accident year combined ratio ex cats on the personal lines business. So the first quarter year-over-year, my numbers show that the accident year combined was up around 2.9 points. Second quarter, that slows down to plus 0.6 points. So curious as to what's happening there. Why is the rate of deterioration slowing? Have you been taking pricing up or have loss cost trends slowed recently?","Glenn Renwick","You want to do that one, John?","John Sauerland","I'm not sure what numbers you're looking at. So you're saying accident year loss ratio through the first quarter of 2014 relative to the first quarter of 2015? And then second quarter 2014 versus second quarter 2015?","Vinay Misquith","Yes, and that's following the personal lines, correct. I'm talking about the combined ratio.","John Sauerland","You're talking about the accident year combined ratio. The expense ratio will be the same. So the loss ratio would be the driver of those.","Vinay Misquith","Yes.","John Sauerland","I'd go back to Glenn's answer on that issue. We are always pricing the business to - and I would add maybe a little confusion to what he had said actually and say when we price business, we're pricing the lifetime combined ratios. So there are instances where we are growing segments faster or slower and the new business is always going to be a different combined ratio than renewal business. And the mix of that business can drive calendar effects."," We are pricing to the lifetime combined ratio by segment but we are also managing the Company to that 96 or better calendar year constantly. So there's a couple different objective functions we are meeting there. And I think again, we're really comfortable with our pricing across all business lines and we think we are doing exactly what Glenn said which is meeting or beating that 96 and we want to grow as fast as we can.","Glenn Renwick","I would also encourage you to think about, at least in the case of Progressive, is pricing is more of a continuous variable than a discrete variable that happens every so often. We give you in the Q, the average premium, the rate of increase of average premium. You can see that's reasonably healthy which is also going to affect the loss ratio as long as that average premium is going up faster than the rate of increase in the pure premium. So just factor all of those things in. There are a lot of moving parts. This is more an informational comment. One of the things that we do is we track all rate revisions done on a monthly basis. That's usually for us, that we track about 200 to 400 rate revisions. So think 50 states, many carriers."," We are seeing on average, and I cluster the last data points because it's quite a variable function. As I cluster the last data points, I'm seeing the market rate of increase at about 2.6 give or take. And there is a give or take to that. And we gave you an average premium increase of 4% in our personal lines business. So we are at least sort of keeping up with that or perhaps our pricing got ahead of that and others are now perhaps catching up."," We also have some mechanisms in our rate. In many states, we're actually continuously taking just a little bit. It doesn't account for a great deal, but it means that each time we can stop on the discrete event of having to adjust for rates. So don't be surprised that you'll see over time, a little bit of closer even in the situation that you are recognizing other than our pricing targets, which is the biggest one, but you will see premiums change at a slightly different rate than pure premiums and in some part that's by design.","Julia Hornack","We find ourselves just past the top of the hour.

The call is scheduled to last about an hour.","As always, our discussions on this call may include forward-looking statements.

Candy, we're now ready to take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Vinay Misquith, Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question is on capital management. We've seen a lower level of share repurchases in the last few months. Curious as to what your views are on a special dividend going forward in light of your excess capital at the subsidiaries?","Glenn M. Renwick","Sure, I'll let Brian take that. But recognize that if we had any significant statement to make, we would have made it in our release. These things that we study, I certainly understand the question. I don't think there's any issues there. To the extent that we have anything to release, we will discuss that with our board in December. But there's really no specifics. Brian can maybe comment a little bit on share repurchase and any other things relative to the dividend, but we have no statement today.","Brian C. Domeck","Sure. I continue to characterize our capital position as strong. We ended the end of the third quarter with $8.8 billion of capital, that's including both debt and equity. Ended October with closer to $8.9 billion of capital, and that includes the retirement of $150 million of debt during the month. So even in a month where we retired $150 million of debt, we had over $200 million of comprehensive income. So strong month in October. Certainly, for the year, our capital creation has been strong with comprehensive income of over $1 billion so far. I would characterize third quarter capital management activity as pretty modest. We did repurchase $54 million of our debt securities. Share repurchases in the quarter were pretty modest, 1.5 million shares, about $38 million worth of shares. So far this year, about $165 million year-to-date. So given all of that, our capital creation for the year has been pretty strong. We've mentioned that we do have the variable dividend that will be payable in late January, early February. If we were to quantify that, just using through October's results, that variable dividend would be about $0.43 a share or about $260 million, approximately those numbers. Obviously, that will change based upon the results of the next 2 months. So we have that as an upcoming activity. But currently, our capital position is strong. And certainly, we always want enough for operations and to grow the business. We feel comfortable with that. We always want enough for contingencies, and it looks like we have escaped an active hurricane season for this year. So we're beyond that. So it gives us more confidence in our capital position. And I think, as Glenn mentioned, we continue to remain committed to what we say, is that we will return under-leveraged capital on the timing of it and the form. It's always under discussion to be determined. But in terms of consideration of a special dividend, yes. In terms of what we will do, more to follow.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So just as a follow-up to that. Should the fact that we have not heard anything about a special dividend mean that it's less likely to happen near term?","Brian C. Domeck","Well, we would only announce it and talk about it after it has been considered by our capital investment committee and the full board. So it's only after discussions amongst them that we'd ever comment on it or make note of it. So it could be about the timing of when or if anything would occur.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure, okay. The second question is on competition. We've heard a large competitor recently announced meaningful rate decreases, and all new [ph] business and the rollout of a new product. Curious as to what impact you think it's going to have on your business. And do you think that also leads to other competitors trying to reduce their cost structure and reduce their commission structure?","Glenn M. Renwick","I assume I know who you're referencing there, and I think that's probably way too early to totally speculate on it. And I don't mean to dodge the question. Do I expect others to reduce their cost structure? I would we've been very clear in including it at our IR meeting of the importance we place on cost structure. And to us, what we believe is a fairly direct correlation between low cost and some of the results we've been able to achieve. So it won't surprise me if we see others take actions that suit their needs, whether that be commission or otherwise. And I understand relative to certain segments of the market, others will get competitive or even more competitive over time. We are always looking to do that. I think I put in my shareholders letter that, sort of, product design, we don't talk about product design quite as discreetly as maybe others because we're always doing product designs. And at any given point in time, we have rollouts of different degrees of product enhancements, and thus, we are working actively. I even gave you some indication of the things that we'll be in, the ones that we're working on right now. So at any given point in time, we're very dynamic. We're trying to work on rate. And if there is rate opportunities in the marketplace that others see, there's a good chance that we have seen them as well. So it's very hard to sort of just go -- yes, one will be X result versus Y result. I think we'll be extremely competitive. And some of the books that are out there that perhaps are not as well priced are always great opportunities for us. So not a particularly insightful answer to your question because there's really no way to give anything more color at this point in time. That may or may not be a strong player in the marketplace. I think we will continue to be a very strong player in the agency marketplace, especially.","Operator","The next question, Mike Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Mike Kovac on behalf of Mike Nannizzi. Through the end of the year, with more modest rate action and lapping easier comps, you guys mentioned building on increased demand. And with other direct competitors growing some of them as high as 30% and the uptick in loss cost trends that we saw in the third quarter, relative to earlier in the year. At your current rate level, how do you guys expect to grow? Do you think it will be more Snapshot based or something broader? And if it's broader, does that imply that your rates today are below that of some of these other growers?","Glenn M. Renwick","Again, always hard to sort of predict exactly on one-for-one. But our demand, I think I've been pretty clear that demand has actually been picking up all year for us. So I'm focusing on the direct side here. Our advertising seems to be working. It seems to be bringing not only good numbers, but good mix of customers. What's really happened, and I highlighted this in the letter is that, that's turning into solid conversions. So on our size and the percentage that we're getting, we're actually very, very comfortable with our growth. I've said before, between GEICO and ourselves, we capture a very significant part of the new market, the new business marketplace, somewhere over 50% of that. So I think that, on absolute numbers, we are in a very good position to see, not only the growth that we're experiencing, but the absolute numbers that are coming in. Do I expect others to compete and increase their intensity from time to time? Yes, absolutely.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And if I could, just a couple follow-ups on Snapshot here. Many of your Snapshot customers have now gone through multiple renewals. What kind of retention data are you learning about this business? I think you talked about -- a little bit about that in the past. And second, of the now over 1.2 million Snapshot customers that you have, what percent of those are sort of new to Progressive? And I know you're finding that your rates for the non-Snapshot customers that you have today are competitive before any UBI-related discounts.","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes, I think that most of the customers, and I say most, there are some exceptions, most of the customers that actually start with Snapshot are new to the Progressive, because it's really offered as a new business, rating enhancements [ph]. So in fact, recently, for reasons that doesn't matter right now, I started a new policy with Progressive, and that vehicle actually was on a Snapshot basis. With regard to retention, it is absolutely true that our experience is that Snapshot customers are retaining longer than an equivalent mix of non-Snapshot customers. I'm not going to give out a lot of data points simply because, clearly, we know the interest in this is high and some of what we know is probably what we should know. But for those that get a substantial discount, we are seeing retention that can lift as much as 40%. And those numbers are not that shocking when you realize that you're probably taking someone to a price point in the marketplace that is simply not available at a new-for-new comparison. So once you've established yourself with the renewal, it's somewhat, I sometimes call it an absorbing state, you have a rate that truly reflects your driving behavior. No one else can know that in the marketplace on a new quote. So the retention benefit of Snapshot has been one of the #1 issues that we've always been focused on. If we could get people to a rate that was reflective of their pure premium and perhaps lower than what the market would be able to recognize without the availability of that rating variable, then there's every reason intellectually to believe that, that becomes somewhat of an inert state that, why would I shift because I simply can't find that rate or better anywhere else. And that certainly is proving to be true at the overall level and even more dramatic at the higher discount level. Having said all of that, we still have very few customers who have been with us on a Snapshot basis or having had the discount with Snapshot for 5 and 6 and 7 years. So we actually look forward to understanding what the long-term dynamics of those customers will be. And as we look forward, all the interim signs are very encouraging. Did I get all your questions on that one?","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. The last one was just, are you finding that your -- the non-Snapshot rate that you're offering today is competitive? So when customers are basically not opting, what does it look like for you.","Glenn M. Renwick","No, that's a good question, too. Recognize that in the marketplace, let's just keep it simple. You go shopping today, you get offered effectively the non-Snapshot rate. So you're getting offered $500 for 6 months -- or let's make it simple, $100 a month, $600. Then you're getting offered the option to take Snapshot with the ability to improve your rate. And after 30 days, we give you the first recognition of that improvement and then a further recognition of the improvement after 6 months. So the actual decision you're making at the point of sale is as, what you might refer to as, our non-Snapshot rate, plus an option. So the rate at the market level is strong and about 36%, slightly up from, I think, the last number I gave you of customers who are shopping on a direct basis are actually opting to take that option, which currently is a free option. It's an option to say, \"I'll take the price, but I may be able to do better.\" As we evolve that product like we evolve all of our product designs, we will likely do things that will be different 5 years from now than what we're doing today and probably sooner. Does that describe the dynamic of the shopping experience?","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. So there's not as much -- so you're not seeing really -- I thought there was a Test Drive in there a little bit, too, where people could potentially get the rate before they sign up as well. So just in terms of what most of your customers are basically, you're saying, getting a rate and then using it.","Glenn M. Renwick","Fair comment. Test Drive was very much designed to do pretty much what you're describing. I would tell you, while very personally hoping Test Drive would be a great opportunity for us to reach out to a different set of customers and not have to have them commit. For the most part, those numbers have proven to be relatively small. And as a result, we will continue to try things. But in the spirit of Progressive, some things we try work really well and some things don't work as well as we expected. I would tell you Test Drive has not produced the numbers that we might have liked. Doesn't make it bad, just means that it's not something I talk about as much when we're talking about Snapshot.","Operator","Next question, Mike Zaremski of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Crystal Lu","This is Crystal Lu in for Mike. I had a question about the reserve development. We've understood that the reserve development was going to be adverse for the first half of the year and favorable for the last half, as management had mentioned in July. But it's running higher than we would have thought in October for the quarter. And so how should we be thinking about the reserve development going forward, given the update you gave in July?","Glenn M. Renwick","Brian, why don't you comment on the reserve development for this release and any other...","Brian C. Domeck","Yes, I'm not entirely [ph] referencing the comments in July, but I'll try to lay a color of where our development has been so far through third quarter, and then again, after the October results. So at the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $80 million of unfavorable development. Call it, approximately 50% in Personal Lines, primarily in Personal Auto, and then another 40% or so in the Commercial Lines products, and then some unfavorable development in our runoff of the professional liability group business that we sold several years back. So the $80 million was fairly comparable to what we had at the end of this first half of the year. So development in the third quarter is actually fairly modest, slightly favorable, if I remember it right. Just a few million favorable for a third quarter. So the third quarter activity in terms of the development pattern was better than, say, we had in the first half of the year. Then in October, we've had favorable development, much of it from actuarial reserve changes in terms of reviews that were done during the course of the month, such that now, at the -- through October, we have roughly $40 million of unfavorable development through 10 months of the year. After the October change, Personal Auto is relatively flat in terms of development for the year. We still have Commercial Lines having some unfavorable development, primarily in our higher limits bodily injury severities where we've had increase in frequency and severity, particularly on the IBNR on that. We still had a runoff in the professional liability group business. That hasn't changed much. But actually, as of October now, Personal Auto was relatively flat in terms of development. A little bit of difference between the channels. Agency has had some unfavorable development, whereas direct auto has had some favorable development, and that really some of the [ph] basis for the reserve changes in the month of October.","Crystal Lu","My other question is about the investment income. Could you give us an update on how we should be thinking about new money yields versus the portfolio yield?","Glenn M. Renwick","Bill, why don't you take that one?","William M. Cody","Sure. Certainly, the higher rates we've seen since the springtime have helped somewhat. Our overall strategy hasn't changed. So if you look at the marketplace and the type of the securities that we own, hopefully we'll have an opportunity to continue to add some securities at slightly better yields than they have been over the past couple of years. So no material changes. And it's just -- take a look at where the market is for the securities that we own and the type of securities that we have in our portfolio and project that forward.","Operator","Next question, Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So 2 questions. The first, obviously, we'll talk about Snapshot, but wanted to talk about your reserve development just a bit more. And from outside looking in, you're talking about service severity decelerating, you're seeing some favorable reserve development. I'm just trying to piece it together. It sounds like it's mostly, if I understand, at least in the Personal Auto side, it sounds like it's mostly coming from more favorable severity playing out than you originally assumed. I'm wondering if you can sort of clarify that, if that's right. And then if that's true, can you give us a sense of the color -- a sense of what severity trends you were assuming when you booked your '12 and '13, like early '13 reserves, and sort of what the magnitude is now of sort of what experience you're actually having and sort of -- as we can sort of think about -- I know, if this is an inflection which -- where we'll end up seeing favorable development play out for another number of months as we go into '14?","Brian C. Domeck","Sure, Josh. This is Brian. I'll provide sort of the color on the actual severities that we're seeing. And I characterize severity trends as modestly positive. So in the property damage covers, call it 2% to 4%, and collision more in the 4% to 5%. So property coverage is a little bit higher. Our bodily injury incurred severity, so this would also include reserve changes, is in the 1% to 2% range. And then PIF severity is actually minus 4%. In the PIF severity, obviously, we weren't necessarily projecting a decrease in severity in PIF. Much of that is driven by Florida, maybe some due to the new regulations. And also, in New York, we're seeing a decrease in severity in New York. So those 2 drivers drive the PIF severity. And we certainly were not necessarily in pricing or anything else, pricing for a negative PIF severity. And I would also characterize our estimate of future bodily injury severities was -- particularly when booking reserves and the like was probably -- is greater than 1% to 2% that we've actually experienced so far this year. And that's how I characterize it, principally driven by a little bit lower on BI. And certainly, a negative severity in PIF isn't what we had anticipated. Gary, do you want to add anything to that? Gary Traicoff, our actuary, is here.","Gary Traicoff","Sure. I think Brian gave a good summary. This is Gary Traicoff, Corporate Actuary. The favorable development, for the most part, has been on the case reserves. And of course, that's going to be a severity driver. To Brian's point, when you look at what our severity was, say, a year ago for BI in particular, it was a little bit higher than where we're at today, looking at the 1% to 2% range. And we were booking a number closer to what we have seen historically relative to a year ago. So that's going to be making up a good chunk of that difference on favorable development.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And I'm sorry, this is really helpful, but you guys reminded me that your statistics, your incurred severity statistics include the reserve changes. So is -- are you seeing a similar deceleration on paids, paid severity changes?","Brian C. Domeck","Yes, the paid severity for BI, and think of BI being the coverage where more of the reserve changes factor in, our paid severities are in the 3% to 4% range for BI year-over-year.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Got it, got it. And so if -- I don't want to hog the call. I'll ask just one more question on Snapshot. You guys are making progress in a bunch of fronts. I'll ask about your licensing deals. It sounds like you've announced a few more, or at least are willing to announce that you have succeeded in a few more. I'm wondering if you can give us some color on -- if you can't tell us who the companies are sort of -- what sort of companies are signing up with you? What the -- or what the ultimate sort of terms that are being negotiated are looking like? And also, on the technology front, if people who are signing up with you are actually going on and using and sort of executing deals with Xirgo to use the technology that you guys have pioneered with Xirgo?","Glenn M. Renwick","Hey, Josh, you're right. Some of the companies that we're doing business with, it's not a lot, as I told you before, for right now prefer that we don't use their name, but we did a release with USAA. So it gives you some sort of flavor. These are companies that are very credible. And when they bring their product to marketplace in '14 -- or '15, excuse me, or whenever, then we'll know more about it. So we pretty much told you the terms of the licensing arrangement. We don't get into exactly what they plan to do and what they don't plan to do and other licenses that they have. So other than what I've really said, there's not much more to add there. This may be just totally editorial, but this is perhaps a little bit of just a personal view. When we talk about severity trends in BI, at any time that you run below 5%, that always has my attention, I just sort of -- historically, sort of that's my threshold point. I would just say that as an industry, and certainly, for Progressive, we are all looking at what might be -- might turn out to be one of the biggest exogenous changes in terms of the Accountable Care Act and how that ultimately forces price changes and so on and so forth. So just as all of us are interested in observing the industry, you and us alike, we don't necessarily know what that will bring. But don't be surprised if severity changes are a little bit variable for the next few years as we sort of see how that settles out. And it won't surprise me at all to see things that go from relatively low to a little bit higher and back. I might be wrong on that, but something that we will have our eye on and recognize that, that clearly has some implications to reservings of claims that are not yet paid or influenced by that. But certainly, on a going-forward basis, the incurreds could be interesting. So just keep that in mind as you observe the industry in general that, that might be a significant driver that we haven't seen before.","Operator","The next question, Meyer Shields, KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","In the 10-Q, Glenn, you talk about, I think, a very rapid rebound on a sequential basis in new business in both Agency and Direct, but a slowdown in the year-over-year growth rate of renewals. And I was hoping you could explain how you interpret that.","Glenn M. Renwick","Yes, I think that's a fair characterization. I think I would be awkward if it was the next quarter, first quarter of next year, when we have this call if I can't sort of report that the renewals are now showing the sort of same trend. I'm not necessarily suggesting double digits. But as we start to see our primary measure, a measure that we have as a primary measure, we have lots of subscore supporting measures. Our policy life expectancy is a lag measure. So it just takes a while for that one to turn. Clearly, we look at other measures that are a little bit more of an acceleration vector. So right now, I feel much more confident in what I can see and report as absolute higher data, which is what I did with regard to the new business, and then gave both a very clear indication. So I think, for gross purposes, 20% business is new, 80% is renewal. So this really needs to flow through to renewal. There's no logical reason why it won't. But I'd like to see that before starting to report on it. My commentary was this is where it must come to roost, and we are starting to see the signs that would make that a true statement. I would tell you, and I can't necessarily explain it with perfect detail, that it's just a little slower than I would have projected. But we're starting to see our renewal rates now head in the right direction. And the other measure that we use somewhat as an earlier proxy, our NPS measures, and those of recent times have started to head up in both channels. So fourth quarter if, as expected, that flows through to renewals, then we'll be in very good shape.","Brian C. Domeck","The other thing I'd add to that is in terms of, say absolute renewal application counts, they're somewhat a function of the policies in force, call it, 6 months earlier, right? 6-month policy term. And so if you were to look particularly, say, at Agency where our policies in force 6 months ago were close to 0 or slightly negative, then how many renewal apps you're going to have on a year-over-year basis is somewhat a function of that, pending changes in retention rates and renewal rates. So as our policy in force growth year-over-year was declining, more so in Agency but also in Direct, the absolute growth rates in renewal apps just follows that. Now as we are starting to see some sequential increases in policy force growth year-over-year, that's when we anticipate that 6 months further down the road, we'll start seeing renewal app growth higher and you'll see it. Since our Direct policy in force growth rate is now over 4%, you should see it in the renewal application, absolute counts, growth rates in Direct more than you will in the Agency.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. No, that helps. The modest decline in PLE in Agency, is that a function of more new business or the type of new business?","Brian C. Domeck","It's not really a function of the new business. I think, for the most part, the decrease in PLE that we have experienced throughout this year is really a function of the rate changes we had made towards the end of last year, which adversely affected retention rates. So that was -- has been what the driver of the decrease in PLE is. And I think Glenn mentioned in his answer to a previous question in terms of the calculations of the PLE, some of it can be a lag measure. And what we are focusing in more and more on our current renewal rates, which we're starting to see increase on a year-over-year basis. But I would say most of the PLE decrease that we experience and comment on is more a function of a rate change as opposed to a mix change.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question is Greg Locraft of Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Wanted to just understand a bit more on new applications picking up. Any intelligence as to where they're coming from, why are folks engaging with you more today versus before and who's losing market share is what I'm trying to figure out.","Glenn M. Renwick","Two thoughts there. One would be an idea that I tried to express in the letter, that our rate, when we take it, we're always taking estimates of future rate. And it turns out that perhaps our loss cost did not go up as fast as we had expected, which makes the competitive point of a rate revision. So think of a rate revision lasting, just not officially, let's just say a year, it's a little less competitive right after you've taken rate and somewhat more competitive at the expiry point of the rate revision. Well, the most competitive point is somewhere in the middle. That's a little hypothetical. Lots of things change around that. But we are now approaching sort of what I'll call that more competitive position. So our conversion rate, the demand has actually been very strong. What we're seeing is, as we move through the life of a rate revision and recognize we're talking here about many hundreds of rate revisions, not one, so it's hard to characterize, but we'll keep it simple, that we're in more of a sweet spot of the rate revision. A second reason that we're getting it is, I also referenced in the letter, we have not done this in wholesale. But in some cases, where those estimates were off sufficiently, then the product manager has actually taken actions to adjust. And Florida is an important state for us. It's our largest state, and we've actually taken rate adjustments in Florida. But it all turned out, as far as we can see right now, to be exactly the right type of adjustments. And those have resulted in a good new business flow for us in the state of Florida, which is an important one. So both the overall competitiveness in most states and a little bit more direct action in some states.","Brian C. Domeck","The other point I'd make is in the direct channel. In the first half of the year, our advertising spend was basically on par with the first half of 2012. But on a year-over-year basis, our advertising spend in the third quarter and continuing in the fourth quarter is very much greater than what it was in the last half of last year. Because last year, given some of the profit concerns, we actually reduced some of our advertising spend from anticipated levels. Now given the demand that we're seeing, the conversion and the yield, our advertising spend is significantly higher than a year ago, which is aiding the quoting activity and demand in the direct channel. As to where it's coming from, we actually do have the data in terms of who their prior carriers are. I don't have it here with me. But we can follow up on that one for you. Maybe talk about it at the next conference call.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just an entirely separate topic and admittedly, incredibly far out. But our auto team here has done a lot of work on the driverless car, the autonomous car. 10 years out is what they say. The technology is there, but adoption is the concern. You guys are, I think, the leaders in the industry on the technology side. Any thoughts around that world, what it looks like, what it means for Progressive, where we're at, et cetera?","Glenn M. Renwick","A lot of thoughts and sort of be irresponsible not to have thoughts. Unfortunately, sometimes, thoughts and knowledge or certainty are different. So we covered a fair amount of that in the IR meeting. But primarily, to try to give some sense of -- essentially, it sounds like similar to what you're doing, where the technology actually exists and then ultimately how it gets into the fleet. There is another level of thinking going on that suggests, and I'm not going to go into it in great detail, what might be insurable interest going forward in a different world. All of us are very familiar with many other industries, whether it will be film and digital photography. The fact is the world takes a lot more photographs today than they ever did, just you had to figure out what was important in that transition. So we're always looking to see what's important. I would tell you that purely, on a personal basis, I am very excited, not just about Snapshot for what it is and what we all have some knowledge of, but it gives us some very direct insight to the vehicle in gross terms. If today, the driver is the biggest single issue of quality defects in driving, accidents happen, there's quality defects, the driver is largely responsible for those. Knowing what's going on in the vehicle is an important aspect. And our telemetry and knowing that gives us opportunities to think about things differently, what might be insurable interest. There'll be a lot of technology in the car. Some of it will be plug-compatible replacement. Some will have dual fault-tolerant dual processing and so on and so forth. There's all sorts of things in there that might come about that represent insurable opportunities going forward. Those are appropriately somewhat blue sky. But as that sky gets clearer and clearer, I'm not sure that I think it will be exactly with anybody else's estimated time frame. But we're not in the business of necessarily worrying about whether we hit that on the nail or not, we'll just continue to refine estimates over time. But along with those estimates, we'll also be starting to ask, what does an insurer look like in the future? And I suspect that's a lot more to do with information that comes from the car than the classical segmentation with regard to characteristics of the driver.","Operator","Next question, Ian Gutterman of BAM.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","I wanted to follow up again on PLE. I guess, Glenn, where I'm a little confused with PLE being down so much this year as I thought, Snapshot, as you mentioned, is supposed to help PLE. And if Snapshot is becoming such a big part of the mix, I mean, if we're -- it looks like we're into the double digits overall. On Direct, maybe it's as much as 20%, I'm guessing. Why hasn't that been more of an offset to the PLE pressure for pricing?","Glenn M. Renwick","Well, it's certainly in the mix. I don't have that broken out. I'm not trying to avoid the question, just don't have it broken out that way. I'd also tell you that Snapshot customers are primarily sort of, or at least have historically been more new customers. So there is -- to the extent that we ever experienced a significant lengthening of PLE, our measures will ultimately have to experience that before we sort of incorporate it in. So to a prior question, I said we really don't have a lot of 5- and 6-year customers. It may be that we are under it, it may be, want to stress those words, that we're underestimating PLE on Snapshot customers. Any time you take on a very different mix, i.e. a customer who has a discount that wasn't previously available to them, we will only be able to experience what we experience. We won't know necessarily what the long-term state of that is. So I hear your question. I understand, and it is affecting PLE. But the effect is probably not as great as you think right now. Will it get greater over time? We may consider breaking that out a little bit. But I will tell you that it's certainly an encouraging vector for the change of PLE over time. The other thing with PLEs is, recognize the ones that we talk about are not necessarily mix adjusted. So we can talk about the PLE for certain classes of customers. We're not going to do that. But it really does require a little bit more of a diagnostic into the PLE to see what type of customers we're getting. Obviously, our non-standing customers are not producing a lot of extension of PLE, but we're very happy to have them, as long as they're paying their full freight in terms of loss costs. Other types of customers, our multiproduct customers, those that are getting a homeowner or those that are getting a Snapshot, are absolutely showing the changed dimension that we think we can incorporate into our overall PLE. And having said all of that, we are perfectly happy to have some short-term PLE customers, as long as they are ultimately profitable customers for us. So it would be a little bit more of a 'maybe we'll do it at a future IR meeting,' but we really need to break the PLE down to considerably smaller segments to be able to see the change. In the macro, you may not see the change as readily.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Okay, understood. Let me just ask one clarification on that. Would it be fair to say Snapshot has benefited PLE more than it's benefited your actual retention? I guess, maybe I'm being simplistic about it, but I thought PLE was policy life expectancy. So if you can incorporate expected benefits versus retention, which is more of an actual. So why wouldn't, if you expect those people to stay for 5 or 6 years because of Snapshot, why wouldn't that be in the expectancy of the PLE?","Glenn M. Renwick","Expectancy is an estimate based on renewal events. So we -- it's not our -- we just don't make a priority estimate. It is based on the observable events of renewal at a 7 month, 6 month renewal. 7th - are they here at the 7th month after the 6th month. So we didn't go in with an artificial or -- we think these customers will last x long and therefore, price them to that. We are actually doing it on loss cost improvements, on Snapshot, not necessarily PLE. As the PLE is measurable, we will incorporate that in.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Okay. Now I think I finally got it. And then my other question, if I could, I'm just curious what initiatives you're working on for -- it seems there's an arguably permanent change in how younger drivers think about cars and more of the ridesharing and some of these other services, which lead to sort of new insurance challenges. Are you working on sort of new products for that type of young consumer that look different than traditional insurance? Are those on the market yet or are they still in pilot? Just curious how you're thinking about that issue.","Glenn M. Renwick","Nothing that is overly specific to those characteristics. Again, at our most recent IR meeting, we talked a little bit about the different characteristics of those younger drivers. You're correct. They're getting licensed later in life, so on and so forth, which actually has some benefits from a loss cost perspective. We're very, very focused on understanding millenniums and what their characteristics might be and the media that they are responding to. So yes, it sort of permeates our thinking, but there's no specific product that we're planning to come out with at this point in time that is focused on that group specifically.","Matt Downing","There don't seem to be any additional questions at this time.

Today, we will begin with a presentation about efficient marketing to maintain a leading brand. Our presentation will last approximately 45 minutes and be followed by Q&A with our CEO, Tricia Griffith; our CFO, John Sauerland; and our guest speakers, Dan Witalec and Cat Kolodij. Our Chief Investment Officer, Bill Cody, will also join us by phone for Q&A.","As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements.

These documents can be found via the Investors page of our website, Progressive.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith.","Tricia Griffith","Thanks, Julia, and welcome to Progressive's Fourth Quarter Webcast. During the last few webcasts, we talked a lot about top line growth as far as revenue. We really outlined on the addressable market on both the auto and home side. It's almost $300 billion of which we have about $30 billion, so a lot of runway, and we're very excited to continue to execute on that plan and continue to gain market share.","For today and the next webcast, we're going to talk a little bit more about bottom line growth, specifically efficiency. Today, we will be on brand efficiency and in creative. But before I go into that, I want to talk about how we think about winning at Progressive and winning in the right way. And we use what we call our four cornerstones: our core values, who we are; our purpose statement, why we're here; our vision, where we're headed; and our strategy, how we're going to get there.","Let me start with our core values. Our core values were penned by Peter Lewis back in 1986. And although the words have been tweaked a little bit along the years, they are really special to Progressive and really special to our culture. They are not just posted on the wall. We really try to bring them to life all the time. In fact, I think I've mentioned before, I attempt to do every new hire class across the Company.","And believe me, that's been a lot in the last couple of years because of our growth. And I do so, obviously, to welcome the new hires, but to be able to talk about our core values and how important they are and make sure that they know that they need to nurture our culture, and it starts with our core values: integrity, golden rule, excellence, objectives, process, all of them woven together to create a really special culture.","Our purpose, so our purpose statement is relatively new. I wrote a little bit about it in my annual letter. Our mission statement was an amalgam of some from Peter, a little bit from Glenn, a little bit from me, and it really became what we do. And for us, that's second nature. So we wanted our purpose statement to be who we are. And so we went to the Company, and this statement was influenced by many different areas of the Company, and we ended up putting it out to a company-wide vote.","And the chosen statement, which is ours, is true to our name, Progressive. What that means to me is really the first eight letters of Progressive: Progress, moving forward, doing better today than yesterday, our rich history of innovation and transparency and always thinking how to be better for our shareholders, for each other and the customers we're privileged to serve.","Our vision, our vision is to become consumer's number one choice and destination for auto and other insurance. We've had this vision for some time. We added destination and other when full force into the Destination Era. Clearly, becoming consumers' number one choice is a big challenge, but as we continue to gain share and as we continue to have customers choose us and then choose to stay with us, we get closer and closer to that vision.","Our strategy which is what we're going to talk about today has four pillars. Let me talk a little bit about those. Our first one is our people, our people and our culture we believe is a true competitive advantage, and we're going to be able to prove that on spreadsheets all of you, probably not, but I will tell you.","Over 30 years ago, I walked into the Indianapolis Claims Office. My intention was not to work for an auto insurance company in Cleveland for 30 years, my intention was to pay off my school debt so I could get my MBA and go back into debt. So what I did was I got claims rep training, I went to the claims office, learned how to estimate cars, learned how to talk to talk to attorneys about injuries. I would tell you about eight month then I fell in love. I fell in love with the people, the culture, the values and every day coming to work and learning something new.","In fact, my team of 12 we have a cumulative tenure of 305 years, so is the place where you want to stay. This is something really important to us. The second pillar is meeting the broader needs of our customers. We like to think of this as where when and how customers want to shop. In our last webcast Heather Day talked about our HomeQuote Explorer, you will hear us call us 82x, just an easy streamline way to have a HomeQuote online to our new digital device.","And we will continue to reiterate that to make it easier and easier for our customers. Our latest innovation in terms of where, when and how customers want to shop is our Flobot, our Chatbot through Facebook messenger to get auto insurance quotes. We will continue to innovate because this is really important for us to serve any sort of customer demographics.","Our third pillar is offering competitive prices. We do this by having leading segmentation in the industry. We do this by having Great Plains accuracy, which is most of any dollar premium that comes in and most importantly being very efficient. The efficiency part will be the subject of our next webcast. We're going to talk about our LAE efficiency and what we call NAR, non-acquisition expense ratio and we'll talk about how important that is.","When you look at the companies that grow and grow profitably they're very efficient. And today we're going to talk about brand. We're going to look at it from two aspects, I'm going to have Dan Witalec, our Leader of Acquisition come up and talk about the metrics around brand. How we use our money wisely? We have a very big budget and we want to make sure that every incremental dollar is gone to great use.","Cat Kolodij, who is our Leader of Marketing Strategy, will be on the other side talking about that creative that works with what Dan is buying. The two worked together hand in glove to make sure we are really proud of our brand. So we're very excited to tell that story, really about the science and art around our brands, acquiring customers and keeping customers.","But before I invite Dan up, we thought we would step back and say, what questions would you have you would want us to answer in these next 40 minutes while they talked. And here are the five we came up with. Are you being smart and efficient with your spend? What are you getting for the actual spend.","The media landscape is changing, are you on top of those shifts. Has progress evolved this messaging as our business mile has evolved? And lastly, we say look at the lesser flow, what are the results of the new creative? We hope to answer all five of those questions and maybe more, but again after they speak we'll be able to answer any other questions you have.","So, Dan, why don\u2019t you come up and talk about the science around acquisitions.","Dan Witalec","Thank you, Tricia. So why are we talking about marketing spend today, as you likely know, we have seen a real explosion in industry, insurance industry, advertising spend over the last two decades. This chart shows U.S. P&C insurance advertising from 1996 through 2016, the last few that we had, industry spend available.","And you can see, there\u2019s been about an 11% average annual increase in advertising spend and the insurance industry. When you compare that to overall advertising spend in the U.S. only going up about 2% or 3% per year, you can really see why insurance has become one of the most heavily advertised industries across the entire country. The rest of it\u2019s certainly been a big part of that, and increase it's spend along the way actually slightly outpacing industry spend during this time.","So that\u2019s why we\u2019re here with all of this spend going on, we want to make the case if you\u2019re spending it efficiently. And we will do that by hitting on these four different topics. So I am going to talk a little bit about the discipline controls that we have around our media spending, then I am also going to talk about our media mix, and then I am going to turn it over to Cat Kolodij to talk about some of our efforts beyond auto and our creative network.","So let\u2019s start on discipline, the natural question is, are we getting a good return for all of that spend that we have going on? So one simple way to look at that is, are we getting incremental sales as we spend more? Here is a chart that shows a scatter-plot that has media spend on the horizontal axis and direct auto unit sales on the vertical axis"," Each dot here is a year, 2001 is in the lower left hand corner, 2017 in the upper right hand corner. So the great news for us here is that in general we see a linear relationship. We have seen and we continue to see generally a linear relationship between spend and sales.","So as we spend more, we are getting incremental sales. And in fact, if you look at 2017 in particular we had a large increase in our media, but we\u2019ve got those incremental sales to go along with it, even slightly above the line here. So we generally feel great about that incremental benefit we\u2019re getting.","So what are some of the controls that we have to ensure that we are spending efficiently? So at a high level, our most important single control on our spending is looking at our cost per sale and ensuring that that is less than or equal to our target acquisition cost. Let me explain each of those.","Our cost per sale is simply our total acquisition cost which is mostly media, but also includes other items like the cost to generate new creative, and we divide that by the direct auto unit sales in a given time period. So, we want our cost per sale again to be less than or equal our target acquisition cost.","I think about our target acquisition cost simply as our maximum allowable spent we have to acquire a new customer. It\u2019s also how much we recover for acquisition expenses over the life of a policy. So it is fundamentally tied to how we price and that is obviously very important for us, but this all fits into our overall pricing and economics.","Now I am going to show some data at a high level in aggregate for our business on cost per sale versus target acquisition costs. But note that we actually have the data and make decisions at a very refined segment level. So for example, a auto and home bundled customer and a high premium state is going to have a very different cost per sale and target acquisition cost than a auto insurance customer who rent in a low premium state","So let\u2019s look at some data on cost per sale. So this is our cost per sale from 2010 through 2017. You can see it\u2019s actually been pretty flat over that time period despite some pretty significant increases in spend. This is actually one chart of my presentation I don\u2019t want to rock it up until the right.","We are actually pretty excited that we've been able to keep cost per sale relatively flat over this time period. Perhaps the bigger story here is that we've actually seen a nice increase in our target acquisition cost over the last several years. Now remember, we generally want our cost per sale to be less than or equal to our target acquisition cost, so we actually feel great about that gap.","And I think it's really a testament to many of the Destination Era strategies we've been talking about, playing out. So what's driving up that target acquisition cost? Probably, most notably, our retention has been increasing significantly. This has long been a goal of ours, and we are really seeing some nice benefits over the last several years. In fact, our retention is up about 15% relative to 2013.","When you have customers stay with you longer, their lifetime profit increases. And so you can spend more to acquire new customers, and that is certainly what we're seeing with retention increasing. On a related note, we are also seeing a nice shift towards longer-retaining customers.","So at the last investor call, Heather Day talked a little bit about our Robinsons segment. That is our home and auto bundlers. Now they are our smallest segment right now, but they are growing the fastest, and that's a segment that retains the longest. So you can see on this chart that Robinsons segment is growing really quickly. They retain longer as they become a bigger portion of our book. That is certainly contributing to our retention as well.","So another way to look at our marketing spend efficiency is to look at our total acquisition expenses in a given year and compare that to the projected lifetime premium of a new cohort of customers coming in, in that given year. If you look at that over time, it's actually been coming down for us.","So again, we feel great about this, a nice testament to the fact that our Destination Era strategies are really paying off for us. While cost per sale relative to target acquisition cost is our single most important control. We look at several other things that could potentially constrain our spending.","So first of all, we need to make sure that our direct auto lifetime combined ratio is at or below a 96%. So cost per sale and target acquisition cost refers to our acquisition expenses, but we also want to make sure our other parts of the combined ratio still all fit together to be at a 96% or less. And we feel great about that.","We also need to be able to service our customers well. It's rare, but there have been times where we're growing so quickly in a state that we don't feel good about the staffing levels. And we have to pull back on our growth by pulling back on media spending. This hasn't been the case recently, but we always put customers first, so we are willing to do that if we need to.","And then the final constraint here is we need to make sure, as you well know, we have an aggregate, company-wide, calendar year combined ratio at 96% or less. In 2016 in particular, we were worried about our calendar year 96%, and so we did pull back on media spend that year because of that. So those are 3 key constraints.","I also want to talk about a fourth one and that is really thinking about our incremental cost per sale and ensuring that, that's sufficient. When I talk about incremental cost per sale, I'm really thinking about the last dollar we spend, making sure that, that is a good use of funds relative to alternative uses of those funds. This is a harder thing to measure, but really critical for us to ensure that we are being efficient overall.","So as I talk about incremental cost per sale, that's a natural, segue into our media mix. So media mix is simply of our total marketing spend, which particular media types are we spending those dollars on. Is it TV, digital, direct-mail, or other media types. So any presentation on media mix has to start with this quote attributed to John Wanamaker, many-many years ago half the money I spend on advertising is wasted. The trouble is I don't know which half.","Our goal really is to try to understand every dollar and make sure we have little to no wasted media spend. So how do we accomplish that? Our main tactic in trying to really understand our incremental cost for sale and making sure that we're efficient is focusing on randomized controlled tasks or AB test.","So what's that AB test in the media space? It simply means that we will have a group of consumers call them the test group or the B group that will receive one of our ads and we'll compare the results of the effect of that ad to a control group -- the A group that doesn't receive that ad. So the difference between those is the lift of that ad.","Now AB testing is not new as long as we've had Progressive.com or auto quoting funnel, we've been doing AB testing and we continue to do them heavily to this day. In media however it's traditionally been quite a bit harder to actually do AB testing robustly, especially in our some of our off-line media.","So I'm going to talk about that in a bit, but let me first just give you an example of why we think AB testing and incrementality is important for us. So here is a fictional car shopping site where you can see a Progressive ad in the lower right-hand corner. So traditionally how we measure the effectiveness of that digital ad, we can actually see when or customer or when a consumer goes to the site and sees our ad and then comes to Progressive.com and actually buys an auto insurance policy from us.","So when we measured in that way in the past, we actually felt really great about these car shopping sites and they're effective at digital ad because we saw a lot of sales after somebody visited a car shopping site and saw our ad. However, several years ago as we thought more about incrementality, we added a new layer to this test.","We had a holdout group or a control group that saw a public service announcement ad had, like this ad here for the American Red Cross, and that group we looked at how often they actually bought Progressive insurance from Progressive.com when they saw this public service announcement ad, and we found that there actually wasn't that much of a difference in terms of sales for people who saw the Progressive ad on that site, versus those that saw a public service announcement ad.","So this was a great insight for us, it led us to advertise that much less on these car shopping sites because we saw that we didn't get true incremental sales from that advertising. Now the main point of this isn't specifically for this example, I think this example is unique to Progressive's particular situation and the power of our brand and our other advertising, the fact that a lot of these people who came to the car shopping site, came to Progressive.com, regardless of whether we had a digital ad.","The bigger point here is that having that system in place is the best way for us to really understand the effectiveness of our ads. So I guess the other thing I'll say on here, you've likely heard various news articles over the last several years about how problems in digital media reporting, so there\u2019s some thought or other reporting issues that may cause wild miscounts of impressions or clips.","This is a big problem in the digital advertising industry. We are less vulnerable to those types of issues because we are measuring incremental sales directly and we get that data on incremental sales without having to depend as much on our partners\u2019 site, so just another reason why incremental media is really important for us and incremental sales are really important for us.","So let me now turn to TV, so like you've also heard a lot about TV and various things going on there. Here\u2019s some data that we look at on what\u2019s going on with TV. So if you look -- this data shows total hours per week of viewing, a traditional TV in the blue line versus non-traditional TV in the orange line.","And for non-traditional TV, think of, Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. If you add those two lines up, you see that total viewing has actually been relatively constant over this timeframe, from 2002 to 2017. But we are seeing a clear shift from traditional TV to non-traditional TV.","Now as an advertiser the issue with that is that non-traditional TV and again think Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, in particular generally has less advertising available than traditional TV. So that means that there are fewer impressions available in the marketplace, the supply is down.","Demand for this content is actually up or at least constant which means that the cost of this media is going up and we may see that typically in CPMs or cost per thousand impressions. That\u2019s a difficult situation to be in as an advertiser. If the cost of your media is fundamentally going up and in some cases pretty significantly, but we still have to hit our three year cost per sale targets.","So how do we deal with that? We have really responded by trying to be smarter about how we buy TV and building a dataset to help us to do that. So let me take you through the dataset that we are building out and how we are approaching this problem.","So we have always known which Progressive ads are on which shows. Obviously we buy the media directly so we have a good view of that. The new dataset that we have is from set-top box data or think of digital video recording devices DVRs from your cable companies, they enable us, they have data that enables us to see which individual household are watching which shows.","Now we\u2019ve always known that in aggregate across the population but we haven\u2019t known it previously at a household level. So if you combine those two datasets, you actually know which households are seeing which Progressive ads. We also have a great view of which households are buying Progressive policies. So if you combine that Progressive sales data with the other data I talked about through a third-party matching service.","So we actually don\u2019t see any of the individual household data, that\u2019s all anonymous to us, but we are able to wending, which Progressive ads are linked to actual Progressive sales. That may seem like a pretty simple thing and honestly in the digital space we\u2019ve had this for a while but in TV this is a real step forward for us.","This type of data allows us to do things like look at a frequency versus response rate curve in TV and frequency -- and let me just explain real quick, that\u2019s not how many accidents you get into in a given year, in this context it is how many Progressive TV impressions, TV ad impressions based household sees in a given week.","So you can see, as they see more Progressive ads, the good news is they're more likely to buy a Progressive policy. But there is a diminishing returns nature to that curve. So that first Progressive TV ad impression is worth a lot more to us. It's much more likely to get a boost in Progressive sales than the 9th or 10th ad that a viewer may see in a given week.","So the fact that that's the diminishing returns curve isn't new news, but having the specific quantification of it is very valuable for us. We also can now see for individual programs, a frequency histogram. So we know what percentage of viewers are seeing their first Progressive ad on that TV show in a given week versus their second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth.","Let me share a quick example of how we actually use this to make decisions. So let's take a given program that we're advertising on with a particular Progressive creative. Let's say it has 1 million impressions, a cost of $15,000. So, it CPM is $15. We've always had that information. The new information is we now have a good view of the frequency histogram for that particular show.","So we know how many viewers are seeing that ad for the first time in a week versus the 10th time. And then based on the frequency response curve I shared on the prior slide, you can actually calculate the incremental sales from that TV ad and then the incremental cost per sale as well.","So let's compare that program A to a different program. So consider it maybe a high-profile award show or something like that, that might be a little bit more expensive. So this case -- in this case, program B has a CPM of $18, so more expensive than program A. But the frequency histogram is very different in this example.","You have a lot more viewers who are seeing their first or second Progressive ad of the week on that program and remember. Those first impressions are so much more valuable to us. So we're actually able to put a value on those and actually generate more incremental sales from this program than program A and, actually, despite the higher cost, have a lower incremental cost per sale from program B relative to program A.","So this is a really powerful data set for us and really shows how we're able to tie some great external data to our Progressive internal data and knowing our economics to make the right business call not just on cost of impressions, but really cost of incremental sales. We actually buy a lot of our media in-house.","And having this type of data available to our buyers is hugely important. In many cases, as the buyers are negotiating with networks, it may mean that they simply walk away from deals if we can't hit our incremental cost per sale target. In other cases, it means we're able to negotiate harder knowing exactly what we need in terms of a price to be able to hit our goals, and it's been a really powerful benefit for us. So that's a TV example.","To be clear, digital is really important to us as well and, in fact, has been growing quickly as a part of our overall media mix. In fact, digital is our single largest media spend category right now, and there are several kind of established platforms that we're on. We're also constantly testing at newer platforms. So video, we referenced before, certainly, YouTube, Hulu, others. We are advertising on and continuing to test there.","Mobile is a huge portion of the new quotes that we get. Actually start on at mobile device, and so we are advertising heavily on mobile. Social is certainly another big category especially as we go into homeowners insurance. We found some new social networks that are particularly interesting to us in that arena.","Games are not just for teenage boys anymore especially in kind of the mobile social era, games are huge we advertise within games but we've also created several gains from Flo or Superstore that our customers can play and are natural advertising tool for us. And then certainly voice as that really explodes recently we are testing with voice assistance and in podcast and other areas so a lot going on for us in the digital arena. So in my portion of the presentation I really focus on incremental cost per sale or the acquisition economics to bring in new customers.","What's was really exciting for us as we look forward though we have new data sources a new information to make some of our media and marketing decisions. We for example, now can often understand not only the impact of an individual media type on acquiring new customers, but also its impact on retaining existing customers. I shared earlier the importance of retention in terms of driving our overall budget and our allowable target acquisition costs.","Obviously, if you have an ad that can increase retention it becomes that much more valuable to us. In addition, increasingly in some media we're able to tie a specific media type to individual customers that that media type is bringing in so we can then look at the profitability of those specific customers by media type and really factor that in along with retention and the acquisition economics to a unified lifetime value model that helps us make smarter decisions in media.","So for example, we may have had a media type previously that had a great low incremental cost per sale, but then we may have found the customers that we were bringing in from that media type at a high loss ratio or low retention which certainly would make us feel very differently about how much we're going to spend for that media. Where we're really going is expanding the lead that we've always had on the pricing side of our business and segmentation and really applying that to the marketing arena.","I started at Progressive as a state product manager and segmentation the importance of segmentation was drilled into my head you know I think we have a ton of opportunity to really take those learnings on the pricing side of our business into marketing and ultimately get to the right message for the right person at the right time.","That's not an easy task and we're not completely there yet, but we have the right team in the right systems in place to really get there over the next several years. I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Now the marketing and media engine that I talked about wouldn't work for us if we didn't have really effective creative that resonate with our target consumers.","So I'm going to turn it over Cat Kolodij to talk about that.","Cat Kolodij","Well, thank you, Dan, I think we've made it pretty clear line why marketing loves to work with acquisition, in fact Dan did a really job of explaining how we measure and distribute our marketing message is critical in today's highly competitive environment, now we're proud to be able to do so efficiently and effectively because of this disciplined approach to media planning and buying.","As we flex our marketing agent for the Destination Era, what we say and how we say it is going to become as important as where we say it. I am thrilled to be able to take some time with you today in order to talk about how we are expanding the brand so that we are known for more than just auto, and also, how we are evolving our creative platform so that we really can manage our network just more likely to connect with more types of people.","Now with everything that progresses, we\u2019ve taken disciplined approach to both message development and creative management in order to generate growth. Let\u2019s talk a bit about how. Let\u2019s begin actually by talking about how we are efficiently expanding our brand beyond being known as an auto insurer. Now a moment ago, Dan talked about the importance of driving shift in our customer mix.","In order to attract additional customers segments, we actually need to improve how we talk about our products and the kinds of services that we provide in order to meet the new and emerging needs of these segments and specifically, meeting these as they evolve over their lifetime. This means we need to expand what our brand is known for, which means we have to begin with the customer segmentation.","Now as a reminder, you\u2019ve probably seen us before, if you've actually been participating some of our webcasts, but we have four major consumer segments. The first two Sam and Diane have simple insurance needs. Sam is our frequent auto insurance shopper. There often driven by price. Diane are our biggest customer segment. They also are interested in price but for very different reason. Because Dianes are trying to save money in order to fund major life events.","So both Sam and Diane are interesting in our price base message but for very different reasons. And both Sam and Diane will always be our core audiences. They remain vital to our growth and in fact most of our broad-based marketing is targeted to their needs.","Now emerging segments are our homeowner segments, Robinsons who bundle their home and their auto together with a single insurance company and Wrights who are auto owners but they actually have insurance for their homes with a different carrier.","Now homeowners as a group tend to really not want to shop a whole lot. So they are really great for our customer attention but not really good for our customer acquisition, cooperated broadcast. We\u2019ve actually talked a lot about our strategy to focus on the younger segments and we continue to do so today.","Because of the inert nature of homeowners we focus on acquisition efforts on a group that we call Future Robinsons. With a more favorable opinion of Progressive and a more active shopping behavior we actually think that this segment is perfect for us and shows a great promise.","Now our strategy is to attract them and retain them so that as their needs change, we actually congratulate our Future Robinsons into Robinsons. But to do this we have to first understand who are they and what do they need and in particular what are the Robinsons need?","So who are the Robinsons? Representing 41% of the auto and owner households in America and 7% of our customers, now that\u2019s the percentage of households that we have, not necessarily the percentage of premiums, the Robinsons segment bundles their auto and home insurance as a single provider.","Now savings do remain important to them and is a key driver of bundling. Savings is not the only they bundle. In fact many of Robinsons bundle because they do have complex insurance needs. And by keeping all of their insurance with one insurer, it actually just makes things a whole lot easier.","What is interesting is many Robinsons need to insure much more than just their auto or their home. In fact, our research indicates that up to 16% of Robinsons have other things in their garage, other things that belong in our special lines product portfolio, like motorcycles or boats or RVs. The thing is that, given our leadership position in special lines, we feel really good about our ability to cover all of their needs, whether it's auto, home or even more.","Now as you might imagine, it's going to take a little bit of time for us to build our reputation among the more mature Robinsons. However, the same isn't true for their younger generations. In fact, if you take a look at the future Robinsons, their needs are much more aligned to what we can offer today. Let's take a look at the chart on the right. If you take a look at the red dots with the dark outlines, those are the Robinsons.","You can see their needs diverge greatly from that of the other segments. Now if you take a look at the red dot with the hash, that's actually our future Robinsons. Their needs are much more closely aligned to the other segments that we've always been very successful with. And we think because of that, we're going to be building on a solid foundation with our future Robinsons.","Actually, let's take a closer look. You probably already understand that Progressive has always been known as a value brand. This is a position that we really do want to maintain in the future years. Historically we've actually put a lot of money into our savings or price-based messaging in order to build up this value reputation.","But the thing about value is that it actually has two parts. Price is very important, but so too is quality. Now we know our reputation as a quality provider will be increasingly important to us as we grow. After all, I just got through telling you that quality is actually quite important for our Robinsons.","Here, you'll see a chart illustrating the degree to which people believe that Progressive is actually a quality brand. Here, quality is a 10 attribute number that include statements like: cares about customer, gives me confidence, resolves problems quickly or is a company I can trust, just to name a few.","Now as you can see here, we actually do fairly well across all the segments. After Sams though, future Robinsons have the second-highest perception of our quality. And after that, it's Diane's. So building on our quality perception is actually increasingly important for us as we expand beyond our Sam and Diane cores.","Now to be clear, this is going to be a balance. Let me talk a little bit in what way. You also probably have seen this before. We actually measure our position in the marketplace on a 2 by 2, where savings perceptions are actually on the vertical axis and quality perceptions are on the horizontal axis.","As you can see, the top 10 national carriers all cluster in the lower left quadrant with Progressive leading the pack. Now unlike Dan's caution that we don't want to see the cost per sale rocket up and to the right, we'll be okay with this perception rocketing up into the right.","So let's take a closer look.","Zooming in, you will see that Progressive is leading the top 4 auto carriers in price perception and is slightly lagging another major carrier in quality perception. Now to be honest, we actually do like our position here, but we do think it could get just a little bit better. So we will begin to change our messages so that we have more quality messages.","And the truth is we think we have a lot of quality stories to tell, whether it's about our product or our service. However we will always be value brand. This means we will maintain what we internally call a price plus position. We will seek to improve perceptions of quality while maintaining our price perception. Now one way to do both at the same time is to consider looking at -- sorry to focus on looking at consideration.","Let me talk about how. When we look at consideration across our segments, like many insurance companies we're actually doing very well with our customers. As you can see here future Robinson customers have the highest consideration of all our segments, this is a strong indication that we're going to do well as these segment graduates to Robinsons over time.","Now the story actually changes just a little bit when you take a look at prospective customers. Prospective customers' consideration is significantly lagging that of our customers, now as I mentioned this is not unique to Progressive. In fact, many major carriers have a very similar picture. This is because people tend to trust their insurance carrier more than the rest of the entire industry.","But if you take a look at our claims satisfaction ratings and our long customer retention among Robinsons it's really clear that our customers know and understand us far more than prospects do. In marketing it\u2019s our job to tell the story of how we take care of those customers more broadly, so we can shape the opinions of both our customers and prospective customers at the same time.","Now doing so with discipline is going to be extremely important, I want to take a few minutes to talk about how we might do just that. What you can see here is a chart with the five major attributes that actually are most correlated with consideration. In other words these are the things that people believe are true about a carrier that they would consider for their insurance needs.","Let's take the first attribute. Our model shows, that if you believe Progressive is for people like me then you are many, many times more likely to consider us for your insurance needs. So how we and other insurers doing against these five drivers of consideration, well, the answer is just okay. If you take a look at the chart you'll see that between 20% and 30% of people believe that these attributes are true of any of the major carriers with only one carrier doing well against is for people like me.","So what does this mean for us, first there's a big opportunity here to focus on messages and our stories on things that are more likely to help people believe that we're this kind of company. In fact we've recently done just that, we've increased the number of messages that we are delivering in mass media so that they are more aligned with homeowner insurance.","Why do we do this, it's because the easiest way to show that we are for people like me is to talk more about the products that people like me need and for many of those that\u2019s home. It's one of the reasons that we actually increased that message to the almost 40% of the market with a target of 40% by the end of the year.","Second, we think we have an opportunity to focus innovations to solve for these needs so that in the future we'll have more stories accounts that are more likely to drive up consideration. Now don't get me wrong, we actually do believe and are beginning to tell stories about our products and services today that we think will do just that.","But believe me when I say it, Dan and I are very excited about the possibility of the new stories that we will be telling about our innovations in the years to come. Now I am going to shift gears for a second, talk about how quality is important, not just in our consumer marketing but also with the relationships that we have with our agent partners.","Now you heard Dan talk a lot about our direct marketing business and that\u2019s clearly important for us as a company. But it\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s important for our growth. Agents have always played a critical role in everything at Progressive. After all we do know the preferred customers, do tend to trust and like the advice and counsel that their agents give them.","Now we feel fortunate that we are actually the most advertised brand in the independent agent channel and we know that from speaking with agents, this goes a really long way. We know that because agents feel like we have a brand that people can trust and because they believe that our brand is getting better over the years, they have greater confidence recommending Progressive to their customers.","But today as good partner, our brand reputation is not just enough. We have to be a supportive business partner too. And it\u2019s for this reason that we will continue to be investing in the things that we know are agents\u2019 need, like more advancements in technology, building stronger business relationships with our agent partners and improving customer service.","To transform our agency channel was actually just recently launched another brand campaign to help tell a different kind of story of the power of the partnership with Progressive. Let me show you just a couple of examples.","This campaign is called Agents Of and it actually turns the camera from focusing on us to focusing on our agents. And we think it does a really nice job of telling the story from an agent\u2019s perspective while occasionally talking about the benefits of partnering with Progressive. We think this partnership is going to be critical in our future and we will continue to do everything we can to improve it.","One of the things we have been doing to improve it, is by doing optimization to drive referral traffic from Progressive.com to our independent agents. In fact, we have seen since 2016 a 52% increase in finding agent activity on our website. We are really happy to see this and hope that this growth will continue overtime because we know that our agents play a very important role in preferred customer\u2019s life and we will make sure to do everything we can to support it.","So I hope that from the first part of my presentation you understand that we are doing everything that we can to expand our message so that we tell stories about the things, the products and services that these new and emerging segments need notes from us.","I am going to shift gears a little bit and talk about our campaign management. Now for anyone that has ever heard any of our broadcast before when we talked about marketing you know that we manage our brand like a network, and we will continue to do so overtime. And as most of you know the centerpiece of our network has always historically been Flo.","Over the past 10 years, Flo has played an important role in establishing our brands and making it recognizable in households across America. She has always been a representation of our employees and a reflection of our culture as being approachable, open and honest.","We\u2019re very grateful that Flo has helped us to tell the story that's been allowed us to differentiate our brand and what is obviously a highly competitive category. The thing is, is that Flo is both a strength and a weakness. She is highly recognizable, and in fact, she triggers a memory of what everyone already knows us to be.","That means they often think about how we make it easy to shop and save for insurance, specifically auto insurance. Now while that's a really great thing, it makes it very hard to deliver other kinds of messages in a way that will get attention.","What you're going to hear today is a story of how we're managing our network by broadening the campaigns that we have in order to have different kinds of campaigns that might be more relevant to different people at different points in their lives so that we can make sure to build the core, but also expand to meet the needs of our emerging segments.","To do so, we actually have three campaigns that we orchestrate together. Now most people when they think of our brand, they think of Superstore. In fact though, we have three campaigns. Yes, Superstore is definitely one of them. And when we talk about Superstore, we mean it's a campaign that you usually recognize from us. It usually has Flo or other shop assistants and\/or The Box.","We will continue to have this campaign in markets because it will continue to be our shopping campaign. We will continue to deliver stories about how we make it easy to shop and save for your auto insurance because that's important to our core. But what's equally important is telling a different kind of story for the different kinds of audiences.","So let me talk about the two campaigns that we're managing alongside Superstore. The first is something that we call \"Funny Because It's True\". This is a platform that we consider a relevancy platform. It's designed to help people take a second look at Progressive so they maybe wonder, do I really know all that they can have to offer.","The third campaign is one that we're calling Extend. Now the Extend platform is our service platform. It's designed to help people see themselves, staying at Progressive. These are three platforms, three strategies all designed to expand the brands for the Destination Era and each playing its unique role. I'd like to take a few minutes to do a deeper dive into each, starting with the Superstore.","Now the Superstore, as I mentioned before, is the world of Flo. It's comprised of a store, characters and icons. Now as I mentioned, this campaign will continue to be important to us as long as it continues to perform well and contributes to our business growth. Celebrating 10 years this year, marketing will continue to evolve this campaign to ensure that it continues to be relevant.","Now, here couple of ways that we're doing so. You've recently seen greater integrations with pop culture, to make sure that we are continuing to have a relevant conversation and maybe introduce something that's me, more me, me worthy. You've also seen us introduce other characters, characters that might look a little bit more like the kinds of customers that we're hoping to acquire.","We've increasingly been creating new situations like Superworld where somebody in a man cave is turning white just like it's turning into a Superstore, or lab, where we launched our HQX or HomeQuote Explorer platform. We think lab is a great platform for us to talk about future innovations.","And finally, we have spinoffs. These are ads that are driven by characters that originated with Flo but have gone on to be the future or the star of a different creative execution, good examples of this are our Rivals or The Box. By changing how we tell our Superstore stories, we keep the concept fresh. By treating Flo like more than a character, we think we can have the brand live on for even longer. Let's discuss how.","What you can see here is something that we call the Mark of Flo. This was actually introduced a few years ago internally, but actually has become much more important for us over the years because the Mark of Flo is helping us transition Flo from a character on television to an icon that can move into perpetuity.","Though it has only appeared in a couple of spots, people are already recognizing the Mark of Flo as belonging to us, in fact in recent research 61% of people aged 18 or older recognize the Mark of Flo as belonging to Progressive or as being Flo. This is really good considering that these numbers are rivaling back of icons that have been in the market for years or even decades longer. So we feel really good about the promise that the Mark of Flo represents for us as a brand.","What even more powerful is the kinds of attributes that people associate with the Company that might have a mark just like this. In fact asking the same people what they would think about a company that has a Mark like Flo, they say, well I will believe it has friendly personnel and accessible service or that it would care for customers or is it for people like me remember an important driver of consideration or even as an industry leader.","Now over the next few years marketing will continue to build equity in our mark so that Flo will withstand the test of time. Now with every, as with everything else that we do we're' going to do this with discipline. The Mark of Flo will be a symbol of our promise to customers appearing as the Flotection badge, reminding customers that we will protect them and the things that they hold dear.","She will also fulfill her ultimate destiny to be an assistant appearing in all the channels that are emerging where people are going for service and for help. In fact Tricia already mentioned an early example of this with our Flo Chatbot app in the messenger app. Now this was built on an AI platform and is a highly branded virtual assistant that answers questions you might have about insurance. What is Flo's favorite color or even start a quote.","What we love most about it, is that Flo's personality her approachability and her spirit will continue to live on even if it's in the virtual channels where people are increasingly going for help. Now the service brand that we've been talking back for years is our Extend platform. Now we know that our customer brand will become increasingly important as we look to retain more and more of our customer base. And we will continue to optimize our Extend program in order to do that.","Take for example the email that you see here. These are our renewal emails and they were launched in order to help customers see the value of the relationship that they have with us and to build confidence that even as their needs change, we will have what it takes to make them happy so that may stay. Now this brand this platform was actually launched in creative communications and focused on the areas where people were either the most confused, felt the most frustrated or in fact were defecting with us from us the most.","This means that we are focusing Extend on boarding renewal and talking more about our loyalty program. We feel really good about the partnership between marketing and the customer experience group in building a new branded experience that today has shown great promise and an ability to extend relationships and extend PLE, but what's even more exciting are the places where we're brining Extend.","Because of their service brand, it should not just be reserved for customer marketing. In fact, with the launch of Progressive Answers, we brought the -- sorry Progressive Answers, let me explain what that is, is a website that actually allows for people to ask question they might have about insurance and we will give them simple answers ones that they can actually understand. We think that there\u2019s a great opportunity to bring the Extend platform into the broader perspective consumer space, so that we can show people just like to be taken care of as a customer of Progressive.","Now finally, I want to talk about the third campaign. It\u2019s dubbed Funny Because It\u2019s True. This platform was actually meant to encourage people to take a second look at Progressive, using humor to talk about a human truth that is highly recognizable. This campaign is meant to be a bridge from the humor and not taking ourselves too seriously aspect that people have come to love about the Superstore and Progressive brand overall.","Our Funny Because It\u2019s True campaign launched with an online video quite a few years ago. Today, it has successfully helped gem homeowners to quite take another look at Progressive, so that they might see that they really haven\u2019t outgrown us even if their insurance needs have become a little bit more complicated. Focused on moments when they are experiencing some kind of light transitions, these moments that we call grown up moments, this campaign is helping to position Progressive as being there and helping them navigate change over their life.","Now recently our campaign has focused on the moment that you first become a homeowner. With the launch Parentamorphosis, this campaign takes a human truth that when you start to realize the responsibilities of owning a home, you start to become a little bit like your parents.","With the success of this campaign, we actually continue to evolve it with a launch of Prized Possessions. This campaign was driven by the insight that you have a couple of things in your household that are really precious to you and maybe nobody else understands it, but we believe that it\u2019s important to you finish it be protective and we assure to help you with that.","You can expect to be a lot more of these campaigns in the future, particularly with an expansion into a campaign for the small business owners. Now Tricia had mentioned that we often get questions about well, I have seen a bit less the Flo, how are these campaigns without Flo doing? I am really happy to stand here telling you that Parentamorphosis, which was launched across both digital and broadcast channels is among our highest performing campaigns in terms of both auto and home quotes.","And as a result, we are actually graduating the Parentamorphosis campaign into our Anchor campaign. Let me talk quickly about how we are doing just this. When we think about our campaign and we\u2019re managing it like a network, we have our Anchor campaign valued Superstore both Extend and Funny Because It\u2019s True are Pilots.","As the pilots continually show performance, we will graduate these to the status of Anchor which is exactly what we did with Parentamorphosis. And as this graduation happens, we will actually be able to test into new and emerging campaigns to fill their spots.","So Dan told you about the complexities of managing both media and message across a complex ecosystem. Let me quickly step you through an example of that for Future Robinsons. We launched heavy strong stories in awareness channels, develop content to drive up consideration and digital channels for people go to seek for information.","And finally, make sure that we had quoting creative in channels where they go for shopping. We think by orchestrating our message and our campaign across the different channels that people are naturally going to for information; we're going to be able to expand our brand efficiently over time.","So in summary, as we increase media spend to drive new business growth by diversifying message and launching more relevant creative, we will drive up demand and shift the customer mix to higher retaining customers, which, in turn, will help increase our customer retention, allowing for a more efficient growth in our book of business, which, in turn increases our efficiency so we can invest more in media. It's something we like to call the virtuous cycle, and something we're very proud of and will continue to nurture over time.","So thank you for your time, please give us a few minutes as we set up for Q&A.","Julia Hornack","[Operator Instructions] Before taking our first participant from the conference call line, Tricia and John would like to answer a question that is likely on the top of many minds.","Tricia Griffith","So John and I are were talking a couple of weeks ago and considering a lot of the questions we're seeing around the Tax and Jobs Act of 2017, so we thought we'd get out in front of it and how we think about it really from all three constituencies, which all we are both aware both customers, employees and stockholders. So we're going to answer sort of a high level. If you have other questions, we can answer them. We also have our resident expert, Jim Cruzman in the audience, if you want a deep dive into anything tax-related.","So let's think about investors. So as a growing company, we need more capital for more growth and to satisfy our regulators. So any profits will help with that. It's always our first choice to reinvest in the Company. In addition, our annual variable dividend considers the tax rate. So all things equal, we'll be about 21% higher. So that's really how we think about it from an investor perspective, growing the Company and our annual dividend.","When we think about customers, we sort of put customers and communities together. So we have a Progressive foundation. It's been in force for over 15 years, and our employees really like it because they're able to give and get a match up to $3,000. In fact, the average amount we paid out of the foundation over the last five years has been $4 million a year, and they can give us as long as it's a not for profit of 501(c)(3) to either national or local communities, a lot of people love giving to the local communities, which, of course, where our customers are, to churches, to schools.","And so, we continue to fund the foundation. And because it's based on underwriting income it will, also all things equal, increase about 21%. In addition, it is the Tax and Jobs Act. And so since the beginning of 2016 to today, we have hired over 13,000 new external hires. So having those jobs, and they're not just in Cleveland, they're around the country, specifically in the claims organization and the CRM organization, having those robust jobs, we believe, really help the communities that we serve.","And lastly our employees, so we are market-based for both compensation and benefits and will continue to be market based. As the market changes, we will shift and we'll watch any inflationary trends. We'll look for key indicators like high turnover in an area of people not accepting our jobs. We no longer ask for your prior compensation, but people might give us anecdotal information, so we are prepared to shift as the market shifts.","In addition and this is related to the tax plan, but how Progressive has always thought about employees is really to our gain share plan. So, I know a lot of companies gave one-time bonuses which I think is great. We've had a gain share plan for over 25 years and in fact last year the gain share of 1.79 our medium bonus was $8,100. So our philosophy has always been when we gain we share with our employees and our shareholders.","So that gives you a kind of an overview of how we've been thinking about the tax changes and now if you want to open it up for other questions that would be great.","Julia Hornack","Great, Latoya, we will now take our first question from the conference call lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Ian Gutterman of Balyasny. Mr. Gutterman, your line is now is now open.","Ian Gutterman","So I guess first just to follow up on what you're talking about on the employee growth. I think there was a newspaper article around you and they suggested, you were hiring 7,500 new people, which is I guess a 20 plus percent growth rate and given there's quite a little bit of wage in there too. Should I -- does that put pressure on expense ratio or I'm reading too much into that? Is that a gross number, not a net number? There's attrition that offsets that just how should I think about that?","Tricia Griffith","Yes, Ian, there will some attrition to offset that. What we've been trying to do is grow in customer facing organizations, we've been trying to keep our non-servicing headcount fairly flat and add when we need to. But again as we grow the ratio of our premium, so as we've grown and added people, it\u2019s worked out. So it hasn't put the pressure you would think on our expense ratio or LAE.","Ian Gutterman","So then just one other topic real quick is on capital, I think there was some language in the K about essentially the strain from some growth, and you mentioned maybe having to raise some debt. I guess I was hoping you could give a little more detail on that. I guess as I was -- I was just taking sort of consensus numbers just as a proxy and it looks like, if I look at where premium growth in street models that requires adding near 3 to 1, as much as a 1.5 billion capital for growth, which is greater than your dividend capacity. So when I look through that, it seems that I shouldn't expect much of a stack dividend this year. Is that the right way to think about it that essentially earnings growth is going to fund the growth and this have to be all the kind of small and the debt will pay the corporate dividend, the debt raise?","Tricia Griffith","Here's how I would think of it, and John you can weigh in. Earnings are material source of our capital and when that's not enough than you can expect that we'd go to the capital markets for more. So we do have a lot of earnings coming in, but that's how we think of it. And literally John and I, and Bill Cody from our Capital Management, and Katherine Brennan our treasurer, we talk about capital all the time in terms of how we can continue our growth knowing the regulatory and constraints you put on the 3 to 1 on the auto. And so, we think about that all the time, but earnings will be a material source of our growth. But again, we can expect to go to the capital markets, if in fact we needed more.","John Sauerland","And to that, you mentioned our dividend, our dividend is an annual variable dividend and is tied to our gain share score, which is a function of growth and profit across our business lines, multiplied times a third of after-tax abstract underwriting income. So, we have established that dividend program for the year, and we would use any capital beyond that obviously as efficiently as possible and today that means reinvesting in the business.","Operator","The next question will come from of Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. Mr. Ransom, your line is now open.","Gary Ransom","I had a question on the announcement that came across recently about Uber and your relationship with Uber, this has expanded. I know you went into Texas a couple of years ago, but you haven\u2019t talked about it recently and it seems like it\u2019s an important source of additional data that can be used in commercial lines and may be there\u2019s some overlap with what you\u2019ve learned in Snapshot with that. And I wondered if you could just update on, how you are looking at that program? What it might mean for your data analytics in your long run? And any other thoughts you have on that program?","Tricia Griffith","Thanks, Gary. Yes, so we started with Uber in Texas in 2015 when it was a pilot on the commercial side, and we\u2019ve been learning a lot and of course this moved from pilot last year to full board and that was added on as of today Arizona, Colorado and Florida. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s necessarily related to an UBI, I would kind of bifurcate though. But I would say that we\u2019re learning a lot about the transportation industry and the T&C industry. And so, we are really excited to continue to work with Uber and add on three more states. Again because it\u2019s new to us, we are going to take a measured approach. And I think we are really excited about that. But I wouldn\u2019t necessarily correlate it to our usage-based insurance.","Gary Ransom","Maybe you could talk about a little bit -- then about the usage-based. Is there anything that you\u2019ve learned or discovered, just update of how powerful you think your Snapshot program has become?","Tricia Griffith","Yes, what I would say is we are really happy about the mobile device specifically on the direct side and the take rate on the mobile device. And so, we are learning more and more and I would say we are learning more and more about distracted driving. We are not ready to use that data in ringing but we are learning a lot, so more to come on that. It\u2019s going to take a while before you gather in and our customers still have the option to have the dongle or the mobile. But we are finding, we are gathering a lot of data on the mobile, and we are learning I would say very interesting segmentation things around distracted driving.","Julia Hornack","Right, Latoya, I am actually going to take a question from the webcast now. The next question is frequency versus surprising benefit in 2017, and one that you probably didn\u2019t plan for in fact I think we\u2019ve said we didn\u2019t plan for. How do you view giving back some of -- the possibility of giving back some of that critical \"excess\" profit to further accelerate growth?","Tricia Griffith","Yes, so when we think about -- yes, one, it\u2019s really hard to understand and predict frequency and in fact -- so over the last trailing 12, we have been -- we had a frequency much more negative than the competition. Third quarter 2017, the rest of the industry kind of changed a little bit as we saw compete fair results. So we are seeing as an industry.","Again, we don\u2019t necessarily bake that into our rate. We don\u2019t see where we are at as of the end of 2017 or even January in excess profits. We think about it as continuing to invest in the business. And again, this is very capital intensive when you think of the regulatory capital we have to have.","But in addition, I might see differently if we weren\u2019t growing. So we have that balance of growth and profit. And so I believe when you\u2019re in a really sweet spot and able to roll really fast and make at least $0.04, remember it\u2019s at least $0.04, we want to do both. And if either one of those change, as you know from 2016, we will monitor that and react to that. But we're going to need capital to grow.","Julia Hornack","Thank you. Latoya, if we could take the next caller from the line please?","Operator","Yes, the next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith at UBS. Mr. Meredith, your line is now open.","Brian Meredith","Tricia, I'm just curious, as I look at your loss ratios and loss ratios going forward. Are you seeing a benefit from the Robinsons to on your loss ratios kind of increasing the mix? And is that perhaps maybe mitigating some of the kind 10-year effect that you typically see with the growth you're putting on?","Tricia Griffith","We would say that our Robinsons are considered lower pure premium, in that they're less likely to get into a loss. The hard part is we look at everything so granularly in terms of states, channels, the products, and I think you would see -- what you'll see probably more movement on, when you think about ratios, would be more on the LAE or NAER side. Do you want to add anything to that?","John Sauerland","Yes, I think you start hitting on the fact that we priced all segments to a common combined ratio target. And the preferred segment, we look at both the loss side as well as the expense side, so both of those are considered in the pricing. There are some segments that drive higher expenses. We build that into the prices as well.","So you will find segments for our business that have actually lower loss ratios, higher expense ratios than perhaps the Robinsons in aggregate. But the point is, is that we are looking very granularly at each segment and making sure that we're pricing to the same lifetime combined ratio target.","Brian Meredith","And then my second question, I'm just curious, going back to the tax stuff, and thanks for the -- your answers there on that one. But my question is more from a regulatory perspective. How do you deal with regulatory potential pushback? Do you expect it, particularly when you make rate filings? You've obviously got very attractive margins and returns right now. Are we going to see pushback? And how do you respond to that?","Tricia Griffith","Yes. I haven't -- it's too soon to tell would be the answer. I haven't really seen -- we have good relationships in the 51 jurisdictions that we're in. Really, a regulator's job is to make sure that we are not excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. And if they look at that and they -- we have actuarial justification that should really be the job of the regulator. And so again, it's too soon to tell, but we have not had any pushback at this juncture.","Julia Hornack","Latoya, can we take the next caller please?","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Mr. Kinar, your line is open.","YaronKinar","I had a couple of questions. First, on the Snapshot mobile device, Tricia, it sounds like one of the aspects of the device or the app -- sorry, may give you access to is distracted driving behavior. Are there any other real significant differences between the data collected on the mobile app as opposed to the dongle?","Tricia Griffith","I would say it likes it's same as the dongle, and then we're able to see if you are -- if it's handheld, a call or an app and hands-free. So we're able to see that, and not sort of using that for rating but just understanding that, as well as location. So those are the things. Again, we're not rating that. We're just gathering data to kind of understand if it correlates to different losses depending on what we see.","YaronKinar","And then the other question I had was more on the agency side. So I think you had added about 1,500 new agencies in 2017. Can you maybe talk about, what the main drivers for that were? And then is there any difference in the profile of these agencies.","Tricia Griffith","No, I wouldn't say so, I mean we have a very broad distribution of agents and if we believe they follow our values and they will sell our products then we will likely have them be a part of the Progressive family. So they're kind of straight across the country 35,000 so, some come and go but I wouldn't say they have anything necessary. The different agents that we talked about in the past really around are platinum agents which we give a different commission base to and access to annual policies on the auto side as well as the home and the ability to earn more depending on how many Robinsons that they get.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Mr. Shields your line is open.","Meyer Shields","John, I want to sneak in a little bit to one of your early responses where you talked about pricing to lifetime profits. Does that imply a bigger initial I'm going to call it new business penalty on the Robinsons because they're expected to stick around for a longer time?","John Sauerland","Great question, it depends on the channel, it depends on the segments. Certainly in the direct channel, we have a material \"new business penalty.\" We don't think of it as a penalty we think of that as the cost of acquiring customers that we're going to keep for a long time. And we again are pricing in the target acquisition costs that Dan was talking about across the life of that policy holders.","So even though we will run well above a 100 combined ratio for a new direct customer we are going to recoup that over the life of the customer. So, the Robinsons into that spectrum certainly is generally speaking a longer retaining end of the spectrum, so we have longer to recoup those costs.","We've normally then would be able to have a smaller load if you will on each policy term, but again the new business combined ratio for direct is going to be far higher, in agency channel there's far less disparity across expenses for new and renewal customers and in the Robinson the spectrum is actually less disparity on the lost performance as well.","Relative to sort of the same end of the spectrum so there's certainly a new business penalty for growing we think the lifetime combines for all those customers are well within our targets so we're very excited to be growing at the pace we are and delivering the calendar year combined ratio results we have as well.","Meyer Shields","Okay and I guess, that's very helpful, second question is. Are there any calendar year constraints that you're enduring right now?","John Sauerland","Right now calendar, our calendar year constraint is the same it\u2019s always been, it's 96 calendar year growth fast as we can as long as we can service our customers. So when we were in a similar position a couple years ago with being able to get out in front of hiring and make sure that we could service our customers and we we're had this competitive price and a great product our 8 to 4 product on the street. We really wanted to make sure to capture as much of the market as we could.","Of course, you remember in the fall of 2016, we pulled back on advertising because of the CAT losses and that's always our constraint. Every calendar year, our constraints are going to be 96 that is a constant its part of our culture, it's not a sale for, and so that will obviously be a constraint. Clearly, right now, one month in its results. We are not seeing that as a constraint. But again we\u2019ve got one month of results in. It\u2019s a long year. We don\u2019t know it\u2019s going to happen with another nature.","I wouldn\u2019t have thought the 2017 would have been a more difficult CAT year than 2016, but of course it was. So that\u2019s really our biggest constraint is our profit goal and making sure we can take care of our customers. And we have been very, very happy. I wrote in my letter of -- what I call our recruiting machine. Not just the amount of people we have been able to hire but the caliber of people. ","When I am ended doing hire classes, I am amazed. And one of the ways we look at that especially in the claims organization is how their accuracy is going. So that\u2019s a large part of what we pay out in loss cause and our accuracy continues to be at record level. So that\u2019s really what excites us about having few constraints right now. It\u2019s a good time here.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Mr. Zaremski, your line is open.","Michael Zaremski","I had a follow-up to the earlier ride-share question but along different lines. So specifically what\u2019s in the personal auto segment, are you able to comment on whether you feel ride-share services are impacting the loss cause? And I guess one of the reasons I\u2019d ask is because an increasing number of insured drivers are making ride-share services a part of their lifestyle, and I\u2019m also pretty sure your client base is relatively more tech savvy than many peers as well?","Tricia Griffith","Yes, we have a personal auto endorsement in 22 of our states. So we always offer them and ask when we are getting navigation as well as a loss if you\u2019re an Uber or Lyft driver. And so we do strive to flush out, and it helps to understand if we need to charge them differently, add an endorsement that is covered. It\u2019s really hard to understand fraud that could happen to people on it, it\u2019s actually why we are offering endorsement. And so I think we believe you\u2019re asking the right questions to the right people at the right time.","John Sauerland","It\u2019s very hard I think to tease out what you are getting at. We do generally younger clientele than some of our competitors certainly on the direct side of business. We think we skew more towards urban areas where we would expect there would be higher penetration of T&C users. But it\u2019s very hard to definitively understand, if and to what degree people using Uber, Lyft et cetera at different times of the evening or weekend are helping a loss experience at all. But it certainly is a great hypothesis, but one that we really can\u2019t answer with any surety.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Ms. Greenspan, your line is now open.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question was related on, in your Tricia you mentioned an internal strategy council that you guys are forming on. I just was hoping to get some additional color there. Is this in response to autonomous vehicle? Is there something else in the industry? And how would that potentially include Progressive potentially expanding and to underwriting its small commercial policies on to our own balance sheet or potentially include additional M&A?","Tricia Griffith","Okay, so if you recall a couple of webcast ago, I went over sort of our Horizon concepts that we have Horizon 1, which we talked a lot about today, execute Horizon 2 which was Expand and also we talked a lot about the commercial that you talked about a little bit Elyse with Bob in small business. What I am having the strategy council really focused on is Horizon 2, which is explored. So you can think of it as assumed there's a day where all these vehicles are autonomous or half of that et cetera, so we're modeling out opportunities for us.","And so right now, the Strategy Council is fairly new. John and I meet with them very regularly. It's a group of 10 folks within the Company. Andrew Quigg, who I think you have met, is doing it as a side to his job of retention and PLE. I mean, we have other people taking some of his work. He's doing a tremendous job. And the team around him, we picked because they had a diversity of a careers for Progressive, and so we're able to leverage those careers to kind of think about what are things that we do really well and if we want to either grow our revenue or replace revenue; if the market gets smaller, what are opportunities we can do.","So we're excited about this council. Again, we're pretty new there, 90 days in. So I'll have more to come as we flesh out more. But we're really excited, and I've been very impressed with their work today.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And my second question, you guys have been growing a lot over the past couple of years. As some of your peers have been retrenching, taking a lot more rate as they've seen pretty high frequency and, in some cases, severity trends. As we think about the overall, it seems like most players in the space are more or less at peak rate taking levels will take less rate and look to grow in '18. As you envision that environment, how does that play into how you think about continuing to go after the Robinson cohort and growing your policies in force?","Tricia Griffith","Yes, I mean, so we've always talked about rate in terms of not having to rate shock our customers. When we've had to do that, you see PLE decline. So we've got out ahead of rates, probably 2015. And we've often said, it's better to have smaller bites of the apple. So 3 1 is better than 1 3 in terms of increase, and so we're really comfortable with our rate right now. And we have watched our competition, and that's what happens. And that's why shopping occurs. This hard market, we've been privileged to get those customers while they're shopping. And because we have a competitive rate, we've been able to grow.","So at this juncture, I don't know, obviously, what all the competition is doing. Very few companies when we look at statutory data, actually, I think as of Q3, only 2 companies were growing profitably. And so I imagine those companies are going to want to get out in front of rate. And hopefully, as people shop, we will continue to be the recipient of those customers, Robinsons, of course, but actually, every customer. We want every Sam, Diane Wright, Robinson we can get as long as we can service them.","We have obviously talked about the Robinsons a lot, because that's really the customer that we want based on our acquisition of ASI on the agency channel and working with other affiliated \u2013 unaffiliated companies on the direct side. So we'll continue to push those. But I think Cat talked a little bit about our changing creative. And really when you think about the Parentamorphosis and owning your first home, that's really addressed to the Robinsons. And so we are seeing -- we're seeing that happen. So we're going to continue with more creative around trying to retain more Robinsons.","Julia Hornack","We actually only have one more caller in the queue, which is perfect given our time right now. So, Latoya, can you introduce last caller please?","Operator","Yes. The next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt at William Blair. Mr. Schmitt, your line is now open.","Jeff Schmitt","Just a quick question on some of the comments from state insurance commissioners, recently about passing on the benefits of the new tax rate or the lower tax rate on to consumers; do you have any view on the likelihood of that or a sense on what that impact may be?","Tricia Griffith","It's hard to say -- it's hard to say, there's a few states out there that will likely do that and we'll react to that. Remember, our combined ratio goal is pre-tax, so our CR496 vehicle is pre-tax. So we will work with the department to make sure we have a product that the citizens of the states. Again, our hope is that once regulators regulate in terms of what I talked about in terms of not being -- not having our rates inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory. But again we're nimble and we'll work with it to make sure that we provide a good rate for the customers and not change our stands on our 96 combined ration goal.","Jeff Schmitt","Okay, and then I'm not sure if you mentioned it, but did you say what the growth of the platinum agents was in '17 and what percentage of total agents is that now?","Tricia Griffith","It sells us small percent, we didn't say, it grew must say like 2000ish.","John Sauerland","In terms of agents it agent headcounts, that's a reasonable number, Yes.","Tricia Griffith","Yes, it's around 2000-2500 somewhere in there. We sort of stopped mentioning it just because we're really focusing on the agents that we have and making sure they have all the tools necessary to get those Robinsons. Again when we rolled out the Robinson model, we really rolled it out as a scarcity model because we wanted to be able to have these agents really wanted to have access to these customers.","So they access that was great and then did they want to have us be number one in their shops. So we're really working now, especially as we integrated the company's, really working on making sure they had everything they need to have us be the number one choice in their agencies. So it's less about adding so many more, I'm sure we'll add more this year but it is really more about the ones that we have really making sure that they have what they need to provide more Robinsons for us.","Julia Hornack","Well, we've actually exhausted our scheduled time, so that concludes the event."],"17713":["The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) Q4 2013 Results Earnings Conference Call February 28, 2014  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Glenn Renwick - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Brian Domeck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","William Cody - Chief Investment Officer","Matt Downing - Investor Relations","Analysts","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners","Josh Sterling - Sanford C.

So my question is, are you satisfied with the 3% to 4% of PIF growth recently. And are you happy with your 93.4% combined ratio, or are you seeking to, maybe ramp up the rate of PIF growth by reducing pricing.","Glenn Renwick","Vinay, so to go back to our core relatively core principal of 96% and grow as fast as we can. So both of those raise questions there, so very happy when we are growing 93%, 94% -- 93% and change. But the modus operandi of the company is really to price as close as possible to a 96%. We're more than happy when we get to better than that, for sure, but PIF growth, and I tried to express that in my letter, that our preferred form of growth is really PIFs. So bringing in PIFs at a reasonably higher rate. Now, recognize we're very conscious, as you would be, of any tradeoffs. You're not going to tradeoff a point of CR for relatively poor PIF growth. But there are combinations of PIF growth that we would see as attractive and be more than willing to have a slightly higher CR than what we achieved last year.","Relative to how we achieve that PIF growth, there is really two big drivers there. You know that. There's new business applications and there's renewals. I foreshadowed, more than foreshadowed in my letter that we took a hit on the renewals after taking rates that we've discussed many times in '12. Those renewal rates now are actually becoming quite healthy. We share with you a PLE measure, which is actually a slow moving measure. And we have actually several other measures, and I think maybe in our IR meeting this year we will give you a little bit more of a way of looking at a score card of measures that might allow you more insight into renewal behavior. So rather than try to do that on just a conference call, we'll do that in a much more formal way.","But the acceleration back there if you like, to the PLE which is a little bit more of a slower moving measure, is actually working quite well. And for the most part the deficit that we've been in previously with renewals is really not the drag that we have now so we expect to see that being in our favor. And new business application counts, I don\u2019t want to get into overly specifics but I'll give you some indication more of just recent times. We're sitting here, not that many days before we release February results, so both Brian and I will be cautious not to go into that territory. But it's fair to say that based on observing the business day in and day out as we do, our new business applications in our agency channel and I'll just go the second half of February, the first half of February had some strange weather conditions which cause presumably businesses to be not exactly on the regular schedule. But second half of February, we are seeing high single-digit rate of growth in new business applications and our agency channel. So pretty happy with that.","And on the direct side we are actually seeing very strong growth and high double-digit growth with new applications. So the outlook for us from PIFs could be healthy. And I say could because we never know what rate we might need to take to balance that. But we would be looking for increasing PIF rate given that we feel our pricing points will allow us to achieve our 96% combined ratio goal. So the tradeoffs are important. We don\u2019t want to tradeoff small PIF growth for big give ups in margin but we think there are appropriate tradeoffs and we feel we are well positioned for that.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners","Sure, that's helpful. Just in terms of the improvement in the new applications and also the PLE. Do you think it's more a function of you keeping rates flat versus the competitors having low single-digit rate increases? And how do you look at the tradeoffs right now from a competitive perspective? Are competitors being more rational and are raising prices right now?","Glenn Renwick","Let me take that in two parts. The change in retention behavior that I said is certainly, and predictably, favorable and continuing to be. So it's much more, in my opinion, a function of our own rate stability. So, our customers are not seeing a dramatically different rate. So, if I bought a policy for, and I'll just use a round term here, $100 and next time I come to renew, my renewal rate is not dramatically different than that, then I'm not incented to perhaps be looking elsewhere. So for renewals, much more a function of our own ability to keep rates stable for our customers. In the new business marketplace, you're well aware that is a highly competitive, almost auction like environment. Certainly in the agency channel, it is close to an auction rate environment. So our new apps there are always going to be a function of our relative competitiveness in the marketplace.","You ask about other competitors, how they are acting. You're better off to assess that yourself. I'll just give you a little bit of the data set that I try to work from. We are very closely monitoring the rate changes brought about by other competitors and recognize we talk about in so many states. There are lots of data points here and there's no one single answer. But if I were to take a look at my scatter plots that I have for a few major competitors, I would probably say, up through the end of last year maybe even through January, we're looking at what I would say the State Farm and GEICO to be something in the plus 2%. So we're definitely in the plus territory as we observe it, and that's not inconsistent with the way we would view the world. Maybe Allstate, a little stronger than that and 3%. And our best record is for Travelers and I think that is not including the Quantum 2.0, so more of the business in place. We look at that and if I eyeballed it, I'd probably say maybe a plus 4%.","So, yes, we see in general the marketplace taking rates up but nothing in what I would call dramatic steps. And there is a fairly good variance around any of those numbers I give you so they are maybe states that have a plus 6 and there maybe ones that have a minus 2, but that gives you a feel. And I'd say on average, competitors are taking rate up at a slow low single-digit rate. And as we look out and think about primarily the driver of severity trend, I would tell you I put that in the 3 to 4 category. That's never a perfect number but obviously we're making estimates with that all the time. So if I look out and see a 3 to 4 severity, I am not surprised to see that kind of rate. It depends on your trend point, how far you're taking your rates out or expect to take them out. Your question was, is the market acting rationally, that's always a really bad thing to be quoted on, so I really want to avoid that. But it seems like there is an awful lot of actions that seem consistent with the data that we see.","Brian Domeck","Vinay, the only thing I'd sort of add to Glen's comments, particularly in terms of retention rate. Certainly rate as a very big factor and influenced 2012, '13 and now in to '14. But we're also doing other things to try to extend each individual policies life with us and we've talked a fair amount about our Progressive Home Advantage program and we certainly are continuing to make inroads in that and that\u2019s continuing to grow nicely. And we know if we can get more of our policyholders to have more than one product with us, whether it be auto and a property product or auto and a specialized product, our propensity to have them stay with us longer increases dramatically. So we are continuing to do things in that environment. We also know our Snapshot program, where those who receive discounts via the Snapshot program, the PLEs of those are better. So we have other initiatives other than just individual rate level changes that have the ability to and are showing to show increases in our PLEs.","Operator","The next question is from Josh Sterling from Sanford C. Bernstein.","Josh Sterling - Sanford C. Bernstein","Appreciate, as always, the letter. So I had a couple of questions on Snapshot, unsurprisingly. You guys didn't do a Super Bowl ad this year but you do say in your letter that we should looking for new products changes and maybe some new advertising in 2014. I'm wondering what you can give us as a preview, both on the product side and sort of messaging. And more generally, do you think 2014 is finally going to be a big year for growth for Snapshot.","Glenn Renwick","Let me start with backwards. Quite happy with $2 billion on the books for '13. So, yes, we would expect to see that and I can, probably shouldn\u2019t, but I can tell you that January we are already looking at very strong growth rates in our Snapshot numbers. So the continuum there feels more likely than some plateauing for sure. I don\u2019t quite know the Super Bowl ad. I lived that experience once. I'm not sure that I've got any great keen desire to go back to that one. But we will sort of get our message from the rooftops as much as possible with regard to Snapshot. And I appreciate your comment with regard to the letter. And I did try to say in there that we're going to use a lot of different tools in our arsenal to make sure that we get the Snapshot message out.","You talk about previews of things to come, and I certainly referenced that we continually work on this. So the answer is, no, I think the time to do that would be much better at a more formal time when we really have some packaging. But I also don't, hopefully, I've never been someone who would say something and not back it up. But let's just take a couple of elements of Snapshot that you're starting to see or I'm starting to see some comments one way or another in the marketplace, whether it be GPS or whether it be continuous monitoring or things like that. One of the things that I would like you to sort of put in the back of your mind is, that as we went through the first ten years or so of R&D, we in fact did more extended monitoring periods. We clearly had GPS in the chip. And we never came out and said, gee, we don't like those things, or that I'm just choosing two elements right now. What we came out and said is, we need to find a packaging that allows us to extract a fair amount of information that is relevant and provides us enough information to pass that on in true cost to the consumer and not absorb all of the monitoring with the cost of monitoring.","So, Snapshot was a time where we took a lot of information that we had and said what is something that we can take to market where, and excuse my liberty here, we didn't need to compete against ourselves. Where we could actually have a package that was marketable and meaningful in terms of pure premium reduction, that wasn't absorbed by the cost of getting that additional data. As I indicated, we will continually refine Snapshot type offering and it will reflect a lot of the consumer trends that we see as well. So, I will not rule out, in fact I would say I rule in that we will consider more GPS type monitoring and the like as consumers are willing to accept that as a viable option. And I think that the answer to that is different today than it was in the past. Just as we do with almost everything else, there is not one solution that necessarily works for all. So monitoring periods, while we have chosen right now to be very discreet and believe that the cost of obtaining that incremental information is a nice tradeoff.","It doesn\u2019t mean that everybody will be equal. It might mean that customer x is monitored for a short period of time and that's sufficient. Customer y may actually be monitored longer. It maybe that certain conditions that you encountered during your tenure with us caused re-monitoring. So, none of those things, and you shouldn\u2019t infer that that is the direction per se of changes, but just know that we've got a lot of information about those sorts of things and it's quite likely that Snapshot and the product will get a little bit more segmented to different customer audiences over time and that we will use things like GPS. ","Just this week I saw our internal R&D. A research level view where overlaying trip data we could overlay things. And this won't come as any great surprise to you, but we're doing it as opposed to talking about it. We overlay the speed limits on any particular trip. We overlay the speed of the car and the delta to the speed limit. We overlay the frequency of accidents in all of United States on that very thing. So there is a lot of external data overlays that we can do. My point here is that Snapshot in the market, relevant producing results that are meaningful for the consumer, but we are scratching the surface of what its potential can be. And as we are aware of some of those potentials, we'll try to build it into the product at a pace that doesn\u2019t have the cost absorb all of the pure premium advantages and also at a pace that we believe that consumers are willing to accept and that we can market it. So it's actually, for me, a hugely fun journey.","Josh Sterling - Sanford C. Bernstein","Thanks, Glenn. That's really helpful color. Obviously a lot of exciting stuff. I guess the big follow-up question I would ask is, when you put all of that in the context of an environment where technology is pretty rapidly accelerating, much faster than you guys started on the journey 15 years ago working on this stuff. How should we think about strategically how you guys are going to play to try to maintain the leads you have today? Because I think and obviously, you mentioned competitors starting to talk about it, those are in some ways easier to put a box around different channels and so on and so forth. The big question that I think a lot of people sometimes struggle with when they get excited about telematics, is just simply, how you guys sort of maintain your lead against potential sort of inroads from like a new tech kind of approach. And I will leave it there.","Glenn Renwick","No, that\u2019s a fair question. And surprisingly at least to my knowledge, I have been very publically consistent on this. I love the fact that we had some patent protection and gave us an opportunity to get into the marketplace. But for me this has always been an issue of get and win in the marketplace. Everything else is extra. And Progressive's strength historically has been using data and segmenting that data to its advantage. So, we had no proprietary rights to something like credit. But you can use credit. We like to think we used it very well. So, I would tell you that the homogeneity of actually being able to get the data will increase. I'm totally with you on that. Frankly, I'd like to get out of the business of having people plug chips into their car and so on and so forth, because that's not an absolutely natural thing for them to do, the cars will be more than equipped. This will be a silly conversation 15 years from now because cars will just be providing that information.","Progressive's strength's always been about what you do with the information as opposed to whether we're the only ones to have it, or only ones to be able to extract it from the vehicle. So what I foreshadowed in my prior comments was just a feel that is far greater than, is it just hard brakes, hard accelerations, factors that we use today. It is demonstrably more and arguably a very different field of data analysis, data collection and data use, that is very, very different than when I was a practicing product manager and it's a very different skill set. And I think that the winners and losers in this one will be the companies that have adapted the technology and have the talent to be able to use that kind of data and convert it into truly marketable products. So that's where I've always seen our advantage anyway. The fact that we have a, or have had for some time, a little bit of a proprietary opportunity in the marketplace, that's great, and that just allowed us to get a huge head start and that head start will be tough to pull back.","Josh Sterling - Sanford C. Bernstein","Thanks, Glenn. We'll have to get our Snapshots so we can grandfather ourselves in before you add all those new variables.","Glenn Renwick","I got mine.","Operator","The next question is from Meyer Shields from KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","I'm sure this question will be more specific than any answer you choose to give. But you talked about Travelers raising rates at around the 4% clip, excluding Quantum 2.0. But they've been talking pretty optimistically about changing their own PIF trends as a result of Quantum 2.0. Are you seeing any signs that you may have to respond to competitive pressures differently in the agency channel, specifically in response to 2.0?","Glenn Renwick","No. Let me comment on, and that's fair, the 4% was definitely not including Quantum. They're rolling that out in a separate company and keeping it apparently pretty clean. Travelers is a great company. I mean I expect them to have a great product and I have no doubt that they haven't been entirely comfortable with some of the trends they've had before. But that's what we've lived within the agency channel all along. So to us, where there will be any competitive response, we're always going to price our product based on our data. We don\u2019t price it necessarily based on what a competitor is doing or not doing. That's the only way we can possibly be true to our combined ratio of 96% goal. We must live with our own cost based pricing. We clearly are responsive to what competitors are doing in other areas and making sure that our story is well told to agents. Positioning ourselves appropriately on comparative raters, that sort of thing.","I just recently went to an internal colloquium on Quantum 2.0, so that all of our people are very briefed on what the product is and positioning. We haven't -- I gave you an indication that even the last part of February our results for agency sales are strong by our standards, so haven't seen anything there particularly. We track proof of prior from other carriers. Travelers is not a particularly high, not the top five type of carrier but we will watch to see if that moves any. And this is all data to tell us what's happening, not necessarily things that would provoke a particular response. But our expectation is that companies will always be refining that product as we are all the time, and that Quantum 2.0 for Travelers who's their next best issue. And my gut from what I have seen is that this feels, at least to the extent that we look at win rates between ourselves and Travelers and what actions have been taken, it seems like it's going to be a very appropriate product offering for agents and that\u2019s always good for the channel as well.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay. Thank you. That was very helpful. Can you talk a little bit about how competition in the commercial auto segment is evolving?","Glenn Renwick","Let me break the commercial segment down to two. This is the light local type business and for the most part I wouldn\u2019t say the competitive nature there has changed a great deal. We're revaluating our own pricing in that space and may have put ourselves just a little bit on the high side for our light local business, but those are tweaks that we'll continue to review. In the, what I'll call the more trucking, for higher trucking and specialty type business, I made a couple of very brief comments in my letter about that. That segment really has been very difficult to price. We have taken a lot of rate over the last two years. We actually feel that we are adding good rate point now, and we have seen some competitive actions there that are a little pull back from the marketplace.","So if I was going to describe the higher end, not necessarily higher end in terms of number of units but the higher end trucks, more trucks than like local artisan type vehicles. I would describe that marketplace as showing signs of a hardening market place. And that rate level, and I mean significant rate level changes that we've taken over the last two years, feel like they will start to become a little bit more competitive and we would see the opportunity to grow. But we have seen some competitors who obviously have assessed their rate level to be less and pulled back from that marketplace. I would say hardening in the top end of the market and not much change that I'm aware of in the light local. Brian, do you, any\u2026?","Brian Domeck","No, I think that's a fair assessment. I think the one place we've seen a little bit more hardening in the market with competitor actions either via rate or underwritings, more in the truck segment.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","I wanted to ask a follow-up on the competitive environment in the independent agent channel, particularly as it has to do with commissions. Progressive was obviously one of the, if not the leader, in taking commissions down but trying to be extremely price competitive as well as extremely user friendly through the use of computer systems. Do you think that the market has begun to follow you down in that strategy? It does seem that Quantum 2, for example, is basically kind of a mimic of Progressive's systems. But I would love your thought, not so much necessarily on Quantum 2, but just on the broader question if we are looking at any independent agent channel at least within auto, is more of a low commission price -- more price sensitive kind of market.","Glenn Renwick","Paul, let me expand a little bit on that and try to be direct with answering your question. You're right, Progressive clearly would be seen by agents as the company that took commissions down. That doesn't always get said with a massive smile because no one wants their compensation to be taken down. So, let me give you the background and these two, at least two really relevant data points here, and I'd like to couch this. And I do this for agents as well. I'd like to couch this. This wasn't some sort of arbitrary, let's just find a different level. Two data points and they span a good number of years. Many years ago, and some on the call may remember, we offered three levels of commission to our agency channel. And for reasons that really aren't pertinent now, we were not allowed to continue to do that. But in doing so, it was very interesting to note that the lower level of commission was by far the largest selected commission level. So there was clearly a marketplace for agents and agencies to be able to sell a product that had the lower commission and, of course, the lower commission reflected in the price. So that was data point one and that wasn't an arbitrary. That was across the entire nation and we saw the distribution being similar in almost every state.","The second thing, and this is where I would argue that Progressive perhaps has a point of view that is certainly relevant and we think important, is that we've been able to determine what, let's just say the true cost of distribution of an auto insurance product is almost independent of channel. So, if on the direct side, and I'm not going to get into the numbers directly, but we have now a pretty good feel for what our cost of distribution is through our direct channel. We are clearly, and we'll state it 100 times, very agnostic relative to how we get our customers. We are happy to get a customer on a variable cost basis. We are happy to get a customer on a direct basis. One of the things we didn't want to do is create an arbitrage between those channels simply on the cost of distribution.","So I would tell you today that we have more on an informed way of deriving a commission rate because it is more reflective of the cost of distribution that we've been able to measure and observe more directly through the direct channel. Previously commission was a little bit, well x pays 15 so I'll pay 15. It didn\u2019t bear a lot of resemblance to what the true underlying cost structure was for an agency and of course that could be very different between agencies. So our way of looking at it is to try to find a cost that seems to be representative of either channel. Both channels can be effective with a cost and no one is particularly arbitraged. And let's just put a number around that, 10 to 12. And our position in the independent agency channel is clearly a market leader, by far the market leader in the agency channel.","So to suggest that others might follow Progressive, that\u2019s a fair assumption. I actually don\u2019t know what their decision criteria is, of why they are doing it. Whether it's Progressive can do it so therefore we can do it, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s for you to ask them. But we know why we have set, and are being very clear with agents why we have set, our level of commission to be at what we think is a true market clearing rate for personal auto, independent of channel. And if that 10 to 12, or even 10 to 11 I would say, is probably closer for our numbers, we feel very good about it and actually have much less conversations today with agents about why because we have a stronger rationale. So that\u2019s some background for you. And does that ultimately mean that the market leader has a fair amount of say in what happens in the channel? To be determined, you will be able to observe that at the same pace that we will.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The next question is from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Just one question, Glenn. I think in the third quarter you kind of mentioned where you were on expectation of loss cost compared to future pricing. I think you talked about that gap being about 100 basis points. Just curious, did that get already reflected in results either in '13 or so far in January? Or are we still working through that? And how should we think about where you are on that spectrum now? Thanks.","Glenn Renwick","I'm sure I said the 100 basis points just not coming to me right away. Third quarter of last year, yes, I suspect that we were feeling that our rates were probably either at or just slightly above what they might have needed to be. Fourth quarter, I think I've shown a diagram or a schematic of how rate revisions sort of come in through time. I would say that the fourth quarter was probably a period where we feel our rates are about close to where they needed to be. And if I were a betting man, I would say that in general we will be looking to move away from what was a very, very flat year in rating in '13. And probably start to see some, just what I would call, natural state adjustments made by our product managers to reflect the trends that are going forward.","And certainly this winter, there is no question this winter has put some frequency stress on PD and collision, specifically. And we internally take a fairly disciplined approach and quite a remarkably detailed approach to determining what the possible range of seasonality might be around our combined ratios. So obviously a good winter, in a bad winter we're going to see some different results. One of the things you want to be able to separate out is sort of noise and signal. Is my overall price level okay and will it be varied a little bit by some weather conditions? And those are really important issues because you don\u2019t want to justify or use weather as an excuse to perhaps lull you into realize -- thinking that your prices are right when they're not. And I would say that we're comfortable that we're in the right band. But going forward we would think that these rate revisions for the most part, and again there is no way to overly generalize that, but for the most part they'd been in the marketplace about the time that we would expect them to be in the marketplace. And going forward, hopefully, we will see similar increases as I mentioned for some of our competitors going forward. Just severity is severity and unless that goes away, you can assume that we will be pricing to it.","Brian Domeck","Just a little bit more in terms of the loss trends. Certainly for the year our frequency was pretty moderate, about 2%. Primarily driven by property damage and collision, but fourth quarter frequencies were actually up higher than the full year average. So fourth quarter frequencies were up. As Glenn mentioned, some of it could be weather related, but they were up. And the severities were pretty much in line with sort of the low single-digit severities we saw for most of the rest of the year, but the fourth quarter frequency was definitely up.","Glenn Renwick","And you can reasonably assume just by looking outside the first quarter or at least the first two months of the first quarter, they are not going to be any different.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Great, thanks. And then just one quick follow-up. On the PHA, it seems like the American Strategic Insurance relationship, that's mostly through the agency channel. Does that imply that the other partners that you have are mostly on the direct side? And where is that relative to kind of where your expectation with those -- was that million customers at this point?","Glenn Renwick","You are right with your assumption. I think, not 100% perfect, we do some ASI on the direct side. But think ASI agent, that is the good way to think about the PHA, and for 99% of the time that\u2019s exactly the way to think about it. All others are on the direct side. So we only have one in the agency channel. That\u2019s the proposition we're carrying to agents and whey it's so very, very important to us and why the ASI relationships are very important. On the other side, obviously we have multiple carriers who've not been shy about saying that Homesite, Ameriprise are important pieces of that piece, a little bit more, so then some of the other 11. And some of them are there for very specific niche type roles. You had a secondary piece that I don\u2019t think I touched.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Actually, that's what I was saying is, where are you on 1 million customers? Where are you on that a year ago? Is that ahead of your expectations? And I guess on that front, what is PLE for this kind of cohort? Thanks, and I'm done, thank you.","Glenn Renwick","Okay. Yes, actually the million is great. We didn\u2019t set a specific goal so I am not going to do revisionist history and say we should have been at 900,000 so we are ahead. We are very happy with the million. I think because we are best when we are perennially slightly unhappy with ourselves, we would like to see the agency contribution to that ramp up some. And certainly that would be a goal for '14 as ASI has been able to work with us and expand the number of states, that can get exciting for us. So keep the momentum that we are seeing. In fact, increase it on the direct side, but I'd say increase it even more so on the agency side.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","And then the [indiscernible]?","Glenn Renwick","Oh, PLE. How do I say this without, no, I'm not going to tell you the PLE because it's going to be lots of different CMTs. And when I say CMTs, if you were at the presentation, think Robinson, think Diane, so on and so forth. It is a variety. Here is what you clearly need to know. We've said it many times that we're doing this, Brian mentioned it earlier, we're doing PHA from Progressive's perspective primarily to do two things. Extend the policy life expectancy of the customers that we write, and we write a lot of new customers, so we want to make them extraordinarily sticky to Progressive. And most importantly, we don't want them leaving us as happy customers but finding a need to have additional products for that point and on in their life. So that's a big part of the motivation to have PHA and, of course, to be able to speak to different customers even at new. So, our policy life expectancy, especially if someone starts with us, perhaps as a non-homeowner and becomes a homeowner, that's the policy life expectancy that is very exciting. And it is meeting all expectations. And I say that with some quotes because we didn't know what to put as an expectation for PLE extension. We do it and measure it. But we're very happy with the measures and the extensions that we're seeing.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The next question is from Ian Gutterman from BAM.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management","I wanted to follow-up on the comments about frequency a couple minutes ago. In the K I think you said frequency was up 2% for the year and I understand you said a little bit of that's weather in the quarter, but we're used to I think frequency being down somewhat. So it seems maybe there's a little bit of core pressure. Can you just talk about any trends you might've seen, and weather aside, do you think those are persistent to '14?","Glenn Renwick","Yes, it's a fair comment. Frequency, and I am not trying to hedge here a lot, frequency is really touchy. I mean the frequency for the fourth quarter, as Brian already said, is actually on a couple of coverages up. And if that were the case and we believe that was going to stay the case, we'd be reacting to it. So, yes, weather is a very real phenomena but it's not an excuse, it's just an interpretation of the data. Here is the one piece of signal that I would say is coming through that we might find to be a little counterintuitive to some of the negative frequencies of the past few years, is we're actually seeing gas consumption go up and mileage go up. So, those are indicators that we follow. I'm not, maybe we have people who are a lot smarter, but I can't necessarily give you a straight causation model there but they are certainly factors that we will keep our eye on.","And as we look forward to the year, and whatever number I give you now, I guarantee won't be right but we always have to have estimates any point in time. We're actually looking to a year where we think frequency will probably be in plus 1. Very hard but that's -- and the plus 1 is not as relevant as it's not zero and it's not negative. So we may see frequency go up. You're probably well aware that new car sales have started to actually show some real life in '13 and presumably the auto manufacturers are looking to see that continue in '14. So gas consumption and mileage is another way of getting at some of that. We're seeing more cars per family. Those things move so slowly but we don\u2019t see indications of negative or flat, which is a change.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management","Interesting, thank you. And then my other question is, can you talk a little bit more -- there was some language in the K, I think you alluded to a little bit earlier, on losing a couple of these patents in the Liberty cases. And I believe there's a third one that's to be decided pretty shortly. And you obviously addressed your data advantage by getting the head start, but just what does it mean competitively if you were to lose the next case? What can your competitors do that they haven't been able to do so far and how does that change the competitive dynamics of usage-based?","Glenn Renwick","If we want to get into the technicality of that, actually we have our Chief Counsel here and we can do that, but I think your question is more general. And, again, I want to be very careful not to give an answer to the feels right for the time. Yes, those things are going on. A couple of adverse decisions, no question about that. I will tell you, and this is no exaggeration, I spend most of my time thinking about how we win in the marketplace. We are a regulated business. We came out a couple of years ago and said we are even going to let other people use the technology. And that was obviously for a fee, we were not going to get super rich off the fee per se, but there was some method to our views on that. I would tell you that if one of the primary objectives of a patent, and I believe this to be true, I have some experience in this, is to give you time to bring things to marketplace.","I think we have at least established for ourselves that we have had a fair amount of time. And I would just tell you I am quite delighted, that doesn\u2019t mean we are not going to continue to press our rights because we think we have rights. We think we were awarded these patents and we are going to continue to do what makes sense for us to do. But for the most part, my answer to Josh earlier, is all about how do we use this incredible data opportunity and data source to our long-term advantage. And when history is written 25 years from now, it won't be about the patents as much as about what we did with the data and how we won in the marketplace. So I'm not sitting here putting that on my top ten list of things to worry about. That doesn't mean my General Counsel has not got it on his top ten list of things to worry about, because I think it is.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management","No, understood. And I agree, you obviously have a big head start. I was just -- as you sort of answered and I am more curious about, you guys obviously have had such a head start and others have sort of, it seems like they've dabbled, if you want to call it that. Is your impression that we are close to seeing a lot more aggressive launches of usage-based among your competitors just, a, given your success and, b, that the patent issue might be less of a hindrance for them?","Glenn Renwick","I am certainly not going to comment on dabbling because that will only create a quote that I won't want to live with. I think we're seeing that anyway. I think we're seeing it, whether or not we agree. Whether it should be done by some with, without our licensing, I think the fact is we're seeing it. I'll make one point to you that, recognize that UBI, for the most part, is most effective for companies who write a lot of new business.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management","Interesting, okay.","Glenn Renwick","And very few companies that have a very large book of business that's relatively inert, are going to want to throw a new rating variable on it that either reduces the margins on the customers they keep or throws other customers into the marketplace. So, keep in mind that those who will have the most advantage from a segmentation variable that is most effective at point of sale, will be those who write the most business. And it's a very important point in my mind, to keep top of mind.","Matt Downing","And that was our last question. Julie, I'll turn it back over to you for closing script.","Operator","That concludes the Progressive Corporation's Investor Relations Conference Call.
