Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street's 2011 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC.","We encourage you to review those filings, including the sections on Risk Factors, concerning any forward-looking statements we make today.

Hooley","Thanks, Kelley, and good morning. Overall, I believe we're off to a good start this year amid continued economic headwinds. First, we achieved solid growth in both fee and total revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Our earnings per share, however, were particularly impacted by the seasonal accounting effect on the first quarter of the annual equity incentive compensation for our retirement-eligible employees, as well as payroll taxes. ","Second, we maintained strong new business momentum with $233 billion in assets to be serviced and net new business at SSgA. ","Third, we received the results of the CCAR stress test released by the Federal Reserve in mid-March. As a result, we were able to increase our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.24 per share, consistent with its previous split-adjusted high. ","In addition, our board approved a $1.8-billion common stock purchase plan, which we expect to begin to execute this month. ","In addition to remarks about the first quarter results, this morning, I will address the economic outlook, our continuing success generating new business in core asset servicing and asset management, the ongoing progress of our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program, as well as our strong capital position. ","As markets improved in the first quarter, a number of our clients began putting their cash back to work. The level of excess deposits left on our balance sheet declined and the performance of our core business improved compared to the fourth quarter. At the same time, investors remained cautious, especially in view of continuing uncertainty in Europe. ","We continue to control expenses. Other than compensation and employee benefits, all other expenses on an operating basis were held in check. The seasonal impact of equity-based incentive compensation for retirement-eligible employees was $76 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $40 million in the first quarter of 2011, an increase of $36 million or $0.05 per share.","We continue to add new business to the core franchise. Of the $233 billion in assets we won in the first quarter, about 2\/3 were in the U.S. We had $10 billion in net new business at State Street Global Advisors. One notable planned reduction in SSgA assets was the $31 billion of asset redemptions from accounts we manage for the Department of the U.S. Treasury. Excluding this redemption, net new business at SSgA in the first quarter was $41 billion. ","Among our larger new servicing mandates was an award for QSuper, an Australian superannuation fund with more than 500,000 members and over $32 billion of assets under management for which we'll provide a broad range of custody administration and accounting services. This new mandate further builds on our previous wins with Sunsuper in November 2011 and REST Industry Super in January 2011. State Street now services 3 of the top 10 superannuation funds in Australia.","The integration of the Intesa Securities Services acquisition has met our stated targets and this business continues to attract new wins. In fact, just recently, we've been appointed custodian to the Fondo Pensione Banco di Napoli, with EUR 700 billion pension fund for the employees of Banco di Napoli. ","Also, the state of Washington renewed its agreement with us for servicing and securities finance for $80 billion in assets. ","Regarding the timing of installations, during the first quarter, we installed $205 billion, $90 billion of which was awarded in the first quarter and $115 billion which was awarded in 2011.","Of the total business award in the first quarter, about $143 billion remains to be installed. ","In the alternative asset servicing area, demand remains very strong. This quarter, we added 42 new mandates in our alternative investment services business and our alternative assets under administration increased from $816 billion as of December 31, 2011, to $895 billion as of March 31, 2012. ","SSgA has been awarded new business from several U.S. public plans including those from Michigan, Nevada, Oklahoma, Indiana and Missouri. ","Now let me share our outlook for the global economy. We expect the U.S. to continue its slow recovery with 2012 GDP growth slightly above 2%. Recent consumer confidence has improved slightly, but housing prices continue to slide as unemployment continues to be a challenge. ","In Europe, the picture is mixed. In the U.K., GDP declined in the first quarter, consumer confidence eroded and the housing market weakened. Germany's rate of unemployment continues to decline, but retail sales in the first quarter were weak. Other Eurozone countries exhibited some consumer strength in the first quarter. And in Italy, wage inflation appears to be stabilizing. However, manufacturing overall appears to be in decline. The long-term refinancing operation by the ECB relieved some of the liquidity pressure in the region, but the debt status of Greece and Spain continues to weigh on the equity markets.","On balance, our cautious outlook is consistent with the moderate improvement in U.S. markets. However, we remain guarded, primarily due to European uncertainty, which can affect the U.S. recovery. ","We continue to be on track in executing our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program and expect to achieve approximately $94 million in annual pretax run rate savings this year, excluding restructuring charges. This brings the total annual run rate savings anticipated to be achieved since the inception of the program through the end of 2012 to approximately $180 million compared to the expense run rate in 2010, all else equal. ","Returning capital to our shareholders has been a priority for us. As I mentioned earlier this morning, we're pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to the increase both in our common stock dividend and in our common stock purchase program that we proposed. We believe the return of capital to our shareholders projected by our post-CCAR capital actions announced in March 2012 is among the highest among major financial institutions also executing on the corresponding post-CCAR announced capital actions. ","Due to the strength of our capital position, we expect to be able to take these actions while retaining the flexibility to respond to future acquisition opportunities should they become available. ","I'll now turn the call over to Ed, and then I'll return to make final remarks before I open the call to questions. Ed?","Edward J. Resch","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll review 3 areas: first, the results for the first quarter; second, I'll summarize the performance of and outlook for the investment portfolio, as well as worldwide interest rates and the impact on our net interest margin; and finally, I'll review our strong capital ratios.","I'll present some of the more significant results comparing the first quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2011, as well as to the fourth quarter of 2011. And this morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings news release.","Fee revenue in the first quarter was approximately flat compared to the first quarter of 2011 and was up 7% from the fourth quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2011, servicing fee revenue was down 2%. The decline in servicing fees from the first quarter of 2011 was due to the impact of weakness in non-U.S. markets in the second half of 2011 and mix changes, offset partially by net new business and a slight increase in the daily average of the S&P 500. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, servicing fees increased 2% due to higher average equity valuations and net new business. ","Management fees were flat with the first quarter of 2011 and increased 17% from the fourth quarter due to higher month-end equity market valuations and net new business. We believe that the implementation of the LTRO in Europe had a positive impact on global investor sentiment, as we saw evidence of U.S. investors beginning to put cash back to work. During the quarter, our investment servicing clients began putting cash back into the market, albeit mostly into conservative short-term and fixed income investments. ","At SSgA, we were awarded $10 billion of net new business, even after the planned $31-billion redemption by the Department of the U.S. Treasury. ","Net new business was composed of 3 main elements: one, flows into ETFs, which had one of their best quarters, adding about $10.8 billion in net inflows. We also added about $8 billion net into institutional funds, primarily passive, and added net flows of $23 billion into cash strategies. Many of these cash flows went back into prime money market funds from U.S. government funds, reversing last quarter's trend. Our fee waivers declined about $2.4 million from $11.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $9.1 million in the first quarter of 2012. ","Regarding trading services and securities finance. Trading services, in the first quarter of 2012, declined 7% compared to the first quarter of 2011, but were up 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Compared to the year ago quarter, first quarter foreign exchange revenue decreased 7% due primarily to lower volatility, partly offset by higher volumes. Brokerage and other fee revenue was down 8%, due primarily to lower transition management revenue. Compared to the fourth quarter, foreign exchange revenues decreased slightly and brokerage and other increased 7% due primarily to an improvement in revenue from transition management. ","In foreign exchange, in the first quarter of 2012, the percentage of total foreign exchange revenue represented by indirect and direct foreign exchange services remained approximately consistent with the fourth quarter. We continue to expect, however, that some clients over time may choose to reduce indirect FX transactions in favor of other execution methods, either directly or through electronic trading. ","Compared to the first quarter of 2011, securities finance revenue increased 47% in the first quarter of 2012 and was up 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Both increases were due primarily to higher spreads. In the first quarter of 2012, the average of one-month LIBOR to the Fed Funds effective rate was 14.4 basis points and the 3-month LIBOR to the Fed Funds effective rate was 39.9 basis points. ","Securities on loan averaged $331 billion for the first quarter of 2012, down from $340 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011 and from $359 billion for the first quarter of 2011, both declines due to reduced demand. Average lendable assets for the first quarter of 2012 were about $2.36 trillion, up 1% from $2.34 trillion in the first quarter of 2011 and up 6% from $2.23 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2011. ","As of March 31, 2012, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 16 days, down from 21 days in the first quarter of 2011 and down from 17 days from the fourth quarter of 2011. ","Processing fees and other revenue was up about $49 million in the first quarter of 2012 from the fourth quarter of 2011, due to the positive impact of fair value adjustments as we successfully exited our fixed income trading initiative. As you may recall, last quarter we announced the withdrawal from our fixed income trading initiative. And as of March 31, 2012, we have substantially closed out all trading positions.","Operating-basis net interest revenue of $607 million increased about 5% in the first quarter of 2012 compared with the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to higher yields on fixed income securities in the investment portfolio and higher spreads on floating-rate securities. ","In the first quarter, excess deposit at the Federal Reserve and other central banks averaged about $18 billion compared to $23 billion in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect the excess deposits to trend down on average for the full year 2012. Including the excess deposits, operating-basis net interest margin was 152 basis points in the first quarter of 2012, compared to 140 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2011. ","Now turning to expenses. Compared to the first quarter of 2011, compensation and benefit costs were up $90 million or 9%, primarily due to the $36-million effect of changes in employee demographics on equity-based compensation for retirement-eligible employees, with the remainder of the increase resulting primarily from merit increases and employees added as part of new business and acquisitions. ","Our compensation and benefits expenses increased 22% or $192 million from the fourth quarter of 2011 to approximately $1.064 billion, due primarily to the seasonal accounting impact of annual equity-based compensation for our retirement-eligible employees and additional payroll taxes, which together accounted for $105 million of the increase. ","In the first quarter of 2012, compensation and benefit expenses were approximately 44.3% of total operating-basis revenue, up from 38.1% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we continue to target a reduction of the ratio of compensation and benefits to total operating-basis revenue by about 100 basis points compared to the 40.2% ratio we had in 2011.","Other expenses were $244 million, up 6% compared to the first quarter of 2011, due primarily to higher regulatory costs, and were down 11% compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower professional fees and lower securities processing costs. ","As Jay said, our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program is proceeding as planned. We continue to expect the amount of annual pretax run rate savings for 2012 to be approximately $94 million compared to the pretax run rate in 2010, all else equal. ","In our operating-basis expenses, we incurred $22 million of nonrecurring costs relating to the program, consisting of $17 million in salaries and benefits and $5 million in several other expense lines on the income statement. As you may recall, we have previously indicated that we expect our nonrecurring costs to peak in 2012 at an average of about $25 million per quarter.","Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio as of March 31, 2012, of $113.7 billion increased about $4 billion compared to December 31, 2011. ","During the first quarter, we invested about $9.2 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of $103.28 and with an average yield of 2.34% and a duration of approximately 2.90 years. Our primary investments during the quarter were in agency mortgage-backed securities, which represented $4.3 billion of new purchases at an average price of $105.60 with an average yield of 2.93%. ","In the first quarter, we have opportunistically invested ahead of this year's plan given the environment. The aggregate net unrealized after-tax loss in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of March 31, 2012, was $81 million compared to a net unrealized after-tax loss of $374 million as of December 31, 2011. The improvement in the net unrealized after-tax position compared to December 31, 2011, was due primarily to tighter spreads, offset partially by higher rates. ","In our investment portfolio presentation, we've updated the data through quarter end for you to review. As of March 31, 2012, our portfolio was 89% AAA or AA rated. The duration of the investment portfolio was 1.57 years at March 31, 2012, up from 1.49 years at December 31, 2011, due primarily to our purchase of agency mortgage-backed securities during the first quarter. The duration gap of the entire balance sheet was 0.49 years, up from 0.36 years at December 31, 2011, and this duration gap is in line with our internal guidelines. As of -- excuse me, March 31, 2012, 58% of our investment portfolio was invested in floating-rate securities and 42% in fixed-rate securities. ","Regarding European assets. We have no direct sovereign debt exposure to the peripheral countries of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy or Ireland in our investment portfolio. Of our non-U.S. assets, we hold about $1.2 billion in securities from those peripheral countries, primarily RMBS and all floating-rate securities. And they are comprised of about $500 million from Italy; $400 million from Spain; and about $100 million each from Ireland, Greece and Portugal. All are performing within expectations and remain current as to principal and interest. ","On Page 7 of the investment portfolio presentation, we list all of our non-U.S. investments and show the average rating as well as the asset types we hold. Our primary non-U.S. holdings are British, Australian, German, Canadian and Netherlands securities, totaling 92% on the non-U.S. investment portfolio. ","At SSgA, our Eurozone exposure in the investment funds is consistent with client mandates. We hold the non-U.S. fixed income portfolios at their benchmark weightings and our actively managed cash portfolios have no exposure to the peripheral countries. ","Regarding pretax conduit-related accretions. Looking forward, we expect to record a total of about $1.1 billion in interest revenue from April 1, 2012, forward through the remaining lot -- terms of the former conduit securities, excluding the approximately $49 million we recorded in the first quarter of 2012. These expectations are based on numerous assumptions, including holding the securities to maturity, anticipated prepayment speeds, credit quality and sales. ","Now for our outlook for net interest margin. First of all, let me emphasize that we continue to believe that we should invest through the cycle and we also intend to invest primarily in highly rated AAA or AA agency mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. ","I'll now review some of the assumptions we used in determining our 2012 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. We believe that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates on hold through the end of 2014, that the ECB has cut rates to 100 basis points and we expect them to hold at that level through the end of 2012. If the ECB rate declines further, we estimate NIR would decline by between $20 million and $25 million on an annual basis for each 25-basis-point reduction. We believe the Bank of England will hold its base rate at 50 basis points through 2012. We project a potential reduction of 25 basis points in that rate by the Bank of England would lower net interest revenue by about $5 million annually.","Based on these rate assumptions and our first quarter results, if our client deposits return toward more normal levels, our net interest margin for the full year 2012 will likely be in the upper half of our 145- to 155-basis-point range. ","Finally, I'll briefly review our capital ratios. In the first quarter, State Street Corporation's capital ratios under Basel I remained very strong. As of March 31, 2012, our total capital ratio stood at 20.6%, our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 7.8%, our Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 19.1%, our TCE ratio was 7.5% and our Tier 1 common ratio was 17.1%. ","Based on our understanding of the Basel III regulations and the information published by the Basel Committee and the Federal Reserve, we estimate our capital ratios under Basel III as of March 31, 2012, to be total capital ratio, 16.0%; our Tier 1 leverage ratio to be 6.2%; our Tier 1 capital ratio to be 14.4%; and our Tier 1 common ratio to be 13.2%.","We were pleased with the results of our CCAR submission and with the return of capital we are projecting to make to our shareholders. ","So in conclusion, while we are beginning to see signs of improvement, particularly in the U.S. economy, the global economic outlook has continued to be uncertain. The LTRO has improved liquidity in the European banks, but it has also restrained growth in new issuances. We still face a low interest rate environment, new regulatory requirements and increased compliance costs. We need to continue to drive fee revenue growth while maintaining cost controls, and we intend to reduce the compensation-to-revenue ratio in 2012 compared to 2011 and also to continue to execute on our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. ","And now, I'll turn the call over to Jay to conclude our remarks.","Joseph L. Hooley","Thanks, Ed. While we're encouraged by the early signs that investor confidence in the U.S. is rebuilding, we remain cautious, especially around the uncertain environment in Europe. During the first quarter, the momentum in our core business returned. The increase in the core business was supported by the installations of new business won last year and new business wins in the first quarter. The flows into SSgA in the first quarter were very encouraging. ","I'm also pleased with the growth in our ETF assets, which exceeded $300 billion as of March 31, 2012, up more than 12% from December 31, 2011. ","We intend to continue to exercise expense control and to successfully execute on our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. ","Our capital position remains strong, allowing us to return capital to our shareholders in the form of increased common stock dividends and a substantial increase in our common stock purchase program. ","Our outlook of cautious optimism for 2012 is restrained by the continued uncertainty in Europe. However, our pipeline of new business potential is very healthy and we expect to contribute to further growth in 2012. ","Now Ed and I are prepared to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Ed, I was wondering if you can just kind of walk us through the comp guidance. This quarter, comp revenues ratio was even -- we had the 105 and then plus a lot of excess, so it was more like 44%. So to get down to that low 39s, got to presume a well-below 39% comp-to-revenues ratio over the next few quarters. So I was wondering if you can help us understand what else either comes out of the comp ratio on the expense side. And also, should we imply that there's also a meaningful step-up in revenues expected? It just seems like a pretty big, big leap to get down to 39% full year.","Edward J. Resch","Well, I mean, it's what we're targeting, Ken. And you're right. I mean it is largely predicated on revenue. We said at Investor Day that assuming revenue grew modestly, that would be our target for the year, to bring it down to around 39.2% for the full year. We -- obviously, we're cognizant of the first quarter step-up, which is just timing, when we made that comment in February. We're proceeding with the ops and IT transformation as we indicated on the call and we're going to target around 39.2%, plus or minus a bit, even recognizing the first quarter step-up, which was significant because of the early retirement accounting.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then secondarily, just wanted to tease out a couple of the transaction-based areas. It looks, on the surface, that it was a soft volume quarter, yet you guys did really well in terms of total trading fees. Sec lending was up sequentially. Can you talk about what you saw in terms of -- was it market share gains? Or was there anything specific to the types of transaction that you guys enjoyed?","Joseph L. Hooley","I would say a few things, Ken. The trading was up 3% sequential quarter. And the -- I would say the drivers were foreign exchange, pretty good performance against lowering volatility in the quarter. I think that was a question of just volumes. We saw our volumes go up Q4 to Q1. I think it's just the result of whether you can interpret share gains out of that. It's hard in that market. But we're pleased with the volume growth to offset the volatility shortfall. The brokerage line, I think it was up 7% sequential quarters. Transition management, which is, again, hard to get market share data in that segment of the market, but we think we're performing pretty well as far as capturing our share of transition. And then securities finance was really more a story of largely holding on to current outstanding and the LIBOR -- the 3-month LIBOR increase. So I think that roughly covers the transitional line items in the quarter.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then asset management had a really strong rebound. I'm just wondering how much of that was just the market, which we can kind of tease out, versus the re-risking that had gone against you last quarter? And I guess it's a question for custody as well. Just the amount of re-risking. Where are we in that kind of -- it was a kind of a sharp decline in the fourth. And how did it re-base as we came to the first?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, let me -- I'll start that and Ed can jump in as well. Very pleased with SSgA performance in the first quarter, up 17% sequential quarter -- on a sequential quarter basis. And it was really a combination of both the markets, which is the obvious point, and very good net new business growth. So if you exclude that Treasury redemption, which was planned, $41 billion in net new flows in the first quarter, which is as strong a quarter as we've had in a while. Highlighted by ETF, we continue to talk about ETF as a focus and a theme for us. We continue to add new products. We saw -- I think it was $8 billion in new flows in the first quarter into ETFs, as well as passive. So I'd say on the -- let me come to servicing fees and then comment about the risking. On the servicing fee side, a little bit of a different story. We were up -- service fees were up 2% sequentially. You'll recall back at the end of the last call, we talked a little bit about the de-risking in the last half of 2011. We saw that start to come back in the first quarter, but it was -- frankly, it was more back-end quarter loaded than front-end quarter loaded, so I think the service fee line reflects that more than the asset management fee line. In the re-risking, Ed mentioned this in his comments, it was a little bit less than one might expect and that was mostly in the fixed income instruments. So we really didn't see a move back, and this is broad strokes, back to cross-border and emerging markets. But we did see good intra-quarter flows into the servicing line. Does that help?","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's great, Jay. And just one final little thing. The processing and other improvement, it was $49 million. I'm just wondering if you can tell us how much of that $49 million was the actual kind of recapture of the fixed income marks.","Edward J. Resch","Virtually the entire delta, Ken.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So, look, the LTRO was mostly a good thing for everybody involved. But I get a sense that it slowed down the deleveraging process and the business unit rationalization. And I think for a while now, you and we all have gotten a sense that there would be business freed up and maybe some consolidation on the heels of this. Has that just come to a halt as well, given the LTRO and the time that it buys some of these institutions?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, Ken -- I mean, sorry, Glenn. I would say that it has slowed it down, so I think that your question, I think, is pointed at custody consolidation in Europe. And we -- so the European banks, many European banks were under capital pressure and there's been a slow move towards recapitalize. I think there are some deadlines upcoming in 2012 which may create a stimulus for that. I think the one thing that we observed, not universally but in several cases, is that European banks who had custody books of business in 2011 were very concerned about funding and liquidity. And the custody banks, even though it might not be strategic with any universal banks, provide a stable source of funding. And therefore, I think there was a little bit of a slowdown. So you could say the LTRO potentially relieved that, with funding being provided by the ECB, maybe less pressure on the core funding. We would hope if that sustains itself, that it might unlock some of those properties in Europe. Haven't seen any recent evidence, but would expect that over time you'd see that.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So you still have expectations of the bigger trend of consolidation?","Joseph L. Hooley","Absolutely.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. One more strategy question. In asset management land, you're clearly on pole position in passive land. And I just thought we'd revisit State Street's, I guess, expectations or aspirations on the active side. And you have more capital than you have approval for, so you've got a big buyback coming. But just thoughts on the active side of asset management business.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I think we -- our asset management business is probably somewhat misunderstood and that there's a fair amount of quantitative active within that $2-trillion-ish pool of assets that we manage. And we think that's a growing segment, the quant active scientific, if you can use those terms. With regard to kind of fundamental active, we have very little. As you recall, we acquired Bank of Ireland's Asset Management business, which gave us a little bit of fundamental active. That's been a good transaction for us. We've been able to leverage our institutional distribution to grow that. We'll continue to selectively look at different asset classes, whether they be active or fundamental active, as I interpret your question, or other places where we have gaps. I think that as I look at the franchise, as you point out, it's got a solid footing in the passive space. I think ETFs gives us another vehicle to create a little bit more product creativity within asset management. And I think we also have, as a core competency, great institutional distribution and some emerging intermediary distribution through the ETFs. So if we can, through acquisition, was your question, selectively acquire asset classes that we think we can leverage up and distribute through our distribution system, we think that would be a smart thing to do.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Super. One last one, and just a numbers question for Ed. On the deposit outflow side, I totally get the environment thawing and therefore some of that money that was parked with you for safety reasons goes out. Can you just talk through what percentage of that piece of the business you think you're through? And then maybe the rate differentials so we can back into our own NIM estimates between the core deposits that you have and those temporary deposits?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, I mean, our thinking for the year, Glenn, full year 2012, is that we basically have the excess deposits that we had in the fourth quarter. So from $23 billion on average down to, let's say, around $11 billion or so for the full year, okay? And it was predicated on that, that we gave you the 145 to 155 and said that -- for NIM guidance, and said that if the deposits stuck around longer, we'd be toward the lower end of that range. And obviously, the converse is true. If they leave more quickly, we'll probably be toward the higher end of that range. So I'd say moving from $23 billion down to $18 billion, we're maybe 1\/3 to 1\/2 of the way there based on our expectations for the full year. But it can move around, obviously, depending on sentiment. But it seemed like there was some thawing, some improvement, as you note, in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on your comments on capital. So it looks like you guys are returning 100% of earnings roughly. Still lots of excess capital, even if you kind of compare that 13% to your sort of self-imposed 10% capital ratio. How should we think about deployment, I guess, of that excess, because it feels like you can continue to do 100% of earnings and still grow capital? So should we be thinking special dividend or something like that? Or this is just kind of like excess capital for potential acquisitions in the future.","Joseph L. Hooley","I think the way you should look at it, Alex, is that we want to have some capacity to execute on acquisitions in a world that we think is going to deliver attractive opportunities. Whether it's the European banking situation, whether it's selectively in the asset management world, we think we're well situated to maintain that flexibility. And we think by increasing the dividend and authorizing -- the board authorizing a buyback, we're providing some relief to shareholders. On the other hand, we think it's prudent to stay flexible given what's likely to be an opportunistic future from the standpoint of acquisitions. And we think we struck that balance.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. Ed, one for you on expenses. So it looks like the clean number this quarter was probably around $1.7 billion. Can you walk us through, with cost cuts coming through probably in a bigger way towards the back half of the year, how we should think about the progression of that kind of $1.7-billion expenses total run rate currently into the second half, between growth in the business plus the net savings coming through?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, $1.7 billion is taking out the early retirement accounting effect, Alex. Is that what you're -- I'm assuming there.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, because that's really seasonal, first quarter thing, right?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, right. I mean, we're assuming that the business will grow this year. We haven't put a revenue guideline out there for you, as you know. We are assuming some level of growth, so there'll be some related expense growth associated with that. And that's factored into our progression for the year. We also expect, as we noted, to get in about another $90 million, $94 million of savings from the ops and IT program. That will be principally in the -- as a reduction to salary and benefits line, which is part of our planning for moving that comp-to-revenue ratio down over the year. So I mean the progression from the starting point of $1.7 billion, as you said, is really a function of what the revenue growth is. I mean, we have, as I said, plans to grow the company. We're not planning on staying flat or down for the year. But I mean, it's hard to give you even a range for the year based on the potential variability of what the revenue outcome is. But I would say that if you started at $1.7 billion, you'll be probably looking at tracking up a little bit from that as we assume our revenue growth comes in per quarter.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right, so up slightly despite the fact that the savings will be coming through in a bigger way towards the back half?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, I think, net -- yes, that's our thinking, again assuming that revenue grows modestly for the year, as we said. And that's consistent with our thinking on the comp-to-revenue ratio again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just looking out, do you expect the usual strength in securities lending in the second quarter?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, we would -- we don't see anything that caused us to believe we won't see that cyclical second quarter, positive cyclical second quarter.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And you have the new buyback authorization and shares were flat. So what's going on there? Why not be more aggressive?","Edward J. Resch","We didn't buy any shares back in the first quarter, Mike.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And what sort of pace do you expect to have? Again, you have new authorization. If you think your stock's inexpensive, wouldn't you be buying aggressively? Or how do you think about buying back stock?","Edward J. Resch","Well, I mean, we can't get too far into our plans for that. But we're going to -- the way to look at the buyback is the remaining 3 quarters of this year and then the first quarter next year, which is the new piece of the program for this year versus last year. So for the remainder of this year, the plan is around $1.35 billion of stock to be bought back, with the remainder in the first quarter of next year. That was the program that we put out. And we'll act opportunistically within the constraints of the marketplace...","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","You can't front-load it?","Edward J. Resch","Well, I mean there are requirements to -- based on volume, as you know, and there's also the particulars of the plan that we submitted to the Fed and the Fed did not object to it. So it's not something where we can just all decide if we wanted to, to front-load it to an extremely large degree, let's say that.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then switching gears. You've said in the past you're a big beneficiary of higher equity markets and the S&P was up 10%, depending how you look at it. Your assets under custody were up 7% and the custody fees were up only 2%. That seems like awful a sequential increase in the custody fees relative to the market and your assets under your custody. So what's happening there?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I think it's -- probably the best explanation for that, Mike, is the re-risking which underlies the issue of servicing fees and growth. We actually saw intra-quarter growth from front to back. And so I think the 2% probably is light if you were to average the back end of the quarter.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So second quarter should be better due to some sort of lag impact?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I mean I think if you assume that equity markets keep the same pace as the first quarter, you'd expect that there is some lag effect which would filter into the second quarter.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Even if there is a lag effect, that still doesn't seem like it's keeping pace with the market.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, we have broadly -- I mean, it's hard to pick a line item. But we say 10% equity markets, 2% revenue growth on a total basis. And that -- so you look at the asset management side of the business and we're up 17% sequentially. So 2% seems a little light, but I don't think extraordinarily light given the trend, intra-quarter, that I mentioned.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then, lastly, the comp ratio. I mean, you're 44% in the first quarter and you're looking for 39% for the year. So should we look at 37% or 38% in the second quarter? And are you looking for an absolute reduction in personnel expenses? Because I don't recall this being overly dependent on revenue growth and now I'm hearing Ed say, well, we need revenue growth to meet our comp rate. And there's a general concern that the customers of State Street are treated well and the employees are treated well, but the shareholders aren't. And today, the market's up over 100. You're the only stock down and so I think there's a general concern about getting the comp and expenses in line. So can you give any reassurances that they will be?","Joseph L. Hooley","I think -- let me start with that and Ed can jump in. I think that I'd point to 2011, which was really the first year that the IT and ops really had an effect. And we were able to drive the comp-to-revenue ratio down, very focused on it. In the first quarter, we have the seasonal expense, which we've spoken about. So I think between internal focus, execution of IT and ops, which we have high confidence in, we think with moderate revenue growth, we should be able to drive that down again this year.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Ed was going to follow up or...","Joseph L. Hooley","Sure.","Edward J. Resch","Yes, I mean I'd just repeat what I said earlier, Mike. I mean, I think that the math, depending on what level of revenue you want to pick, is in the right range. I think the earlier question was somebody saying 39% in future quarters. But clearly, it's got to be below 40% in a meaningful way to drive to 39.2% for the full year. It's something that we're focused on. And as Jay said, it's something that we delivered on last year. If you recall, the sequential quarter decline in the comp-to-revenue ratio was something that we targeted and we delivered and we brought it to 39.2% -- I'm sorry, 40.2% for the full year. So it's something that we believe we're going to get. And relative to my statement about revenue, I mean revenue, obviously, is a piece of the function here. So my only comment there is that if revenue were, for some reason, and we don't anticipate this to be soft, okay, in a meaningful sort of way, that revenue would be a significant challenge for us to get for the full year. But again, we don't anticipate revenue being soft and we are planning on modest growth and will drive to the 40 -- the 39.2% approximately for the full year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Jay, can you talk a little bit more about the investment servicing? Obviously, the lower yield on the asset -- on the custody and administered assets is, to some degree, a factor of the revenue mix that you alluded to. And you also implied that it's getting better as we move to the back half -- back end of the quarter into second quarter. But can you also comment on to what degree pricing or through servicing mix impacted that? And when I say servicing mix, I mean mid-office versus custody mandates and things like that.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, sure, Brian. Let me try to give you a little color. From a mix standpoint, nothing really extraordinary. We commented on the Australian superannuation business where we've made nice strides in the last 6 months. That's kind of a typical mix. We also had a big deal around real estate administration. Again, shouldn't have been a real change in mix. So I don't think mix was dramatically different within the quarter. I think that there was the lag effect of when people were re-risking. I think that had some effect. And regarding pricing, I would say that we continue to, almost quarter-to-quarter, get more aggressive or more aligned around pricing strategies with our customers. So in the last couple of quarters, you've seen some effect, but we would expect that as we continue to make sure that all of our relationships are appropriately priced, that pricing will be a -- more of a factor in time. So I don't think you can point to the quarter and say pricing was a factor, but I would leave with you the notion that we're pretty focused on pricing and we would expect over time to that -- for that to be a contributing positive.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So as we move through the year, if we think about a little bit of re-risking in the business mix, maybe a little bit of sort of sequential traction in pricing, we should expect that revenue yield on administered assets to improve as we move through the year?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I would say, again, all else equal, we continue to see good markets. All of those things. The mix may be a little lesser effect. But other than that, yes, I think that's probably a fair assumption.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the FX business, you mentioned that obviously this is a strong quarter and very consistent on the indirect versus the direct, but you do expect a headwind. Any way to frame what type of headwind we should expect? I know it's almost impossible to do on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but, say, over -- on an annualized basis over the next 1 to 2 years? This is the headwind from moving from -- from clients moving from direct to -- or indirect to direct, rather.","Joseph L. Hooley","Let me give you the strategic response to that and then if Ed has anything, he can add. Our strategy has been to -- we've got a broad range of FX offerings, and -- is to drive volume. And we can drive volume not only in existing customers, but in -- in existing servicing customers, but in non-servicing customers because of the variation of foreign exchange offerings that we have. So I think you can see some of that in the first quarter where we're driving volume in the case of this quarter outrunning volatility changes. We would hope over time that, in the mix shift from indirect to direct or other electronic means, that we could overrun -- outrun that with volume. So that's what we're attempting to do. And, Ed, I don't know if you'd...","Edward J. Resch","Yes, just on indirect, Brian, it's clearly something that we're focused on, as are other people, given the publicity around it. We had a $4-million to $5-million sequential quarter decline in Q3 -- in Q4 from Q3. This quarter, actually, the indirect revenue picked up to bit. So there's no -- there's clearly no evidence of a trend from Q4 to Q1. But it is something that we're monitoring. The business overall, though, is performing pretty well and we'll keep you posted as to if any trends from a client standpoint develop.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just on the processing fees, Ed. I think we were thinking about $70 million being a normalized run rate on a quarterly basis after the fourth quarter $25-million write-down. And obviously, we're much higher than that in this first quarter. What should we think about for a normalized run rate over the next 3 quarters?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, I mean that number, as we've said many times, can move around. But I think if you're thinking in the range of $70 million to $75 million for kind of a \"normalized level\" for that line, that's probably a good range to pick, Brian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just want to go back to the processing fee line that moved around this quarter. It was up $49 million. But then last quarter, if I recall correctly, there were some markdowns on some of those securities. So how should we think about that as kind of a good kind of run rate number, because some of that won't stay around obviously?","Edward J. Resch","Well, I mean, it was all related to our decision to exit a fixed income trading initiative that we had looked at in the last couple of years, Andrew. So on a go-forward basis, given that we're done with the exit, there should be no effect to that line for those types of market value adjustments.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Right. But then last quarter, it was unusually low, if I recall, in the fourth quarter, right?","Edward J. Resch","Right.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So if we adjust for that and adjust for the upward revisions this quarter, based on kind of the -- my quick take on it, it looks like kind of in the mid-70s or low 70s should be kind of a good run rate. Is that fair? Or am I missing something in terms of...","Edward J. Resch","Yes, yes -- no, that is fair. I just answered that to a question previously. But yes, I think if you strip out the fourth quarter and first quarter impact of this exiting that we undertook, yes, $70 million to $75 million is probably a good estimate for that line on a normalized basis. I mean that line can move around, as we've said. But that's probably a good range.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just to back up a little bit on -- a lot of focus obviously on expenses this quarter and going forward, but -- in your comp revenue target. But can you just give us a sense of kind of overall this year, is it achievable? Or is it possible to achieve positive operating leverage in this environment, given we're still not into kind of the heavy lifting on the IT cloud initiative yet? Or do we have to wait until next year?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, again, I think it's, in large part, a function of how the revenue picture unfolds for the full year. And as we've said, if revenue does not grow in a robust way, operating leverage will be a difficult thing for us to achieve, with obviously the opposite being true, that if revenue grows 10-plus, 12-plus percent on an annual basis, the operating leverage should move rather easily onto the page. So I think it's too early to say what our prediction is for the full year, Andrew, but at a relatively modest level of revenue growth, I think it's fair to say that operating leverage will be difficult to achieve on a full year basis, assuming the market-driven revenues continue to be in something of a trough.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of John Stilmar with SunTrust.","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Gentlemen, just with regards to your operating expense initiatives. One of the things that you've talked about is not just the dollars of expense savings and the potential operating leverage past 2012, but also new business wins that could drive the top line. Are you seeing evidence that -- or can you share with us progress, at least in terms of potential new business wins or new areas, that we might think about for the top line because of capabilities and functionality that you've created from your operating expense initiatives?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, John, we have started to see some of that. In fact, this quarter, we introduced a couple of new products. They tend to be data- and analytics-oriented new products and services, which were enabled based on moving to the cloud environment. So I think it's early days. But the evidence is quite strong that in the cloud environment, we'll be able to not only improve the speed with which we deliver new services, but the flexibility around information and analytics services which are in great demand by our customers. We should be able to be a little bit more creative and innovative on the information side. And we did introduce, I think, 2 products, in particular, in the first quarter that fit that bill. So I think, appropriately, the IT and ops transformation is focused on executing against the cost saves. But your question just -- does draw out a point, which is we think it's transformational because we think that we're doing something that no one else in this custody group is doing and it will, over time, enable us to differentiate more on the product side, and we see evidence of that.","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess your answer dovetails back into my second question, which is many of us analysts -- and we've repeatedly asked on this call. The yield or fees per assets under custody, which, for lack of a better term, has shown less of volatility during down markets and doesn't necessarily trend up as well during bullish markets, which leads me to think that the services business or the custody business has a greater proportion of fees that aren't necessarily tied directly to assets. If that's -- one, would you agree that over the past 2 years or so that there's been a greater composition of custody revenues that aren't necessarily tied to assets? And if so, how should we think about that unfolding for the next couple of years?","Joseph L. Hooley","And when you say -- are you isolating servicing fees or overall fees?","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just the asset custody fees, fees per AUC.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, it's -- unfortunately, the mix is so varied, whether it's alternative, whether it's long-only, whether it's U.S., non-U.S., whether it has a middle office component. It's hard to isolate those variables to give you a clear direction on that. Our strategy is to, as you know, by our 80% of new revenues coming from existing customers, to cross-sell a wide variety of products and services. And we think over time, if we do that and customers are successful and assets grow, not only will we be the beneficiary of the revenue growth, but we can also further penetrate some of the transactional service fees. But it's hard to isolate specifically for that question. Thanks, John. We look forward to talking to all of you at the end of the second quarter call. Thanks.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

Turning to slide 3, you will have seen we announced our second quarter financial results this morning, reporting second quarter EPS and ROE of $1.42 and 10.1% respectively. Relative to the year ago period, our results reflect challenging industry conditions, including client pricing, global industry outflows and volatile interest rates, as well as weaker international average market levels. When compared to the first quarter, our results stabilized somewhat and were supported by market tailwinds within our asset servicing and investment management businesses as well as a slight seasonal uptick within our markets business.","Assets under custody and administration reached $32.8 trillion and we are encouraged by strong new wins in the quarter of $390 billion with assets yet to be installed at $575 billion. At Global Advisors, assets under management increased by 4% quarter-on-quarter to $2.9 trillion, supported by higher period-end equity market values as well as institutional client wins and cash inflows. At CRD, we are encouraged by our first front-to-back investment service client agreement and six additional exclusive discussions that are in advanced negotiations.","At the same time, the pipeline continues to grow as evidenced by another quarter of increasing client engagements. Following our strong performance under the 2019 CCAR stress test, we anticipate increasing our common dividend by 11% in the third quarter, while conducting $2 billion of share repurchases through the second quarter of 2020 as our proactive balance sheet actions in 2018 contributed to our ability to return an increased level of capital to shareholders.","We continue to believe our front-to-back strategy positions us well for success in the medium and long term. And while we may currently be seeing some stabilization in servicing fees, we have not yet returned to growth. As such, we will be updating and sharpening our core business strategy as well as conducting a fundamental reassessment of our technology ecosystem. We have established teams to focus on reinvigorating revenue growth, accelerating the simplification of our operations model, and reducing non-personnel expenses.","At the same time, we continue to act with urgency on the things we can control while fostering a culture of execution and productivity with reinvigorated attention to delivering industry-leading client service. I believe we are making progress in these areas. For example disciplined expense management continues to be one of my top priorities, the firm-wide hiring freeze for all noncritical roles outside of CRD has been very effective. Year-to-date we have already reduced high-cost location headcount by more than 1,800 staff and expect that as a result of our actions we can increase that number to 2,300 by year-end.","Process automation efforts are in full gear, allowing us to decrease headcount while delivering even better service and outcomes for our clients. Furthermore, year-to-date the $350 million expense savings program we announced in January 2019 has already achieved just over $175 million in total year-over-year savings and we are now increasing our targeted expense saves under the program by an additional $50 million to $400 million for 2019.","Our focus right now is finding better ways to reignite revenue growth and generate additional expense reductions, while driving sustainable improvements in our operating model. This means addressing and surmounting the wave of asset manager pricing pressure, completing our executive client coverage rollout, using the increased capacity we have achieved for balance sheet optimization to restart growth in securities lending and trading, and leading in alternatives and ETF servicing, where we are second to none.","Our vision remains becoming the leading asset servicer, asset manager and data insight provider to the owners and managers for the world capital. I am confident we are strategically aligning the organization with the fastest-growing and most attractive client segments, but we must continue to find ways to better serve these and all of our clients in a more holistic and scalable way. We have to continue to innovate and by doing so grow more diversified revenue streams.","We must continue to reduce complexity across our operating model through increased automation and by simplifying our technology stack, while reengineering our client and organizational processes in order to drive efficiencies, while delivering industry-leading client service. There are a number of areas we are examining, such as leveraging our IT partners to create better technology outcomes at lower cost.","We also have an opportunity to leverage process improvements and expertise within our global hubs to drive further efficiencies, while being constantly focused on resource discipline. As we drive these initiatives forward, I and my team will provide strategy and progress updates in the fall, including a reassessment of our technology plans.","And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.","Eric Aboaf","Thank you, Ron and good morning everyone. Let me start on page 4. On the top-left panel, we show our GAAP results as well as certain results ex notable items and seasonal expenses for those of you who want to see some of the underlying trends. On the right panel, we summarize notable items, including $12 million pretax or $0.03 per share in 2Q, 2019 of acquisition and restructuring cost, primarily related to Charles River.","Turning to slide 5. We saw period-end AUC\/A levels decline 3% year-on-year and remain flat quarter-on-quarter. The quarter-on-quarter move in AUC\/A was driven by the impact of the previously announced BlackRock transition, partially offset by higher spot market levels. In regards to the BlackRock transition, please note that the 2Q, 2019 saw the departure of approximately $450 billion of fund to fund AUC\/A which was part of the previously announced deconversion and had no material revenue impact this quarter.","AUM levels increased 7% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter to a record $2.9 trillion, driven largely by higher equity market levels and institutional wins. 2Q, 2019 saw inflows of approximately $20 billion, the second sequential quarter of positive flows and were driven by institutional wins and cash.","Moving to slide 6. Servicing fees were down 9% year-on-year, but flat quarter-on-quarter. While challenging industry conditions persist the pace of the quarter-over-quarter servicing fee pressure moderated somewhat during 2Q 2019. Unpacking the drivers of 2Q's flat sequential quarter results, we estimate that, market levels were a 1% tailwind, flows and client activity taken together with net new business were a slight positive, while client pricing was less than a 1% headwind.","We are pleased that the actions we have taken since late last year are having some impact. These include the rollout of our new client coverage model, which has opened up more shared of wallet opportunities. And our newly formed pricing review committee has strengthened discipline leading us a moderation this quarter which we expect to continue for a couple of quarters.","Nevertheless, as Ron mentioned, we are not satisfied with the servicing fee results and recognize that we need to do more to restart fee growth. On the bottom left panel of this page, we added some AUC\/A sales performance indicators to provide a little more texture to our servicing fee dynamics. As you can see, AUC\/A wins totaled $390 billion in 2Q, 2019, up significantly on a quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year basis, while at the same time, our AUC\/A-to-be-installed this past quarter was also up to $575 billion.","While we are encouraged by these sales performance indicators, we also know that we need to maintain similar such momentum going forward. I would add that Charles River continues to help drive our investment servicing client dialogues and we are excited about our first agreement to provide front-to-back investment servicing for Lazard Asset Management more on that in a few minutes.","Turning to slide 7. Let me discuss the rest of our fee revenues. Beginning with management fees, 2Q revenue was down 5% year-over-year, driven by the ongoing impact to the late 2018 outflows and mix changes away from higher-fee products, partially offset by higher equity market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were up 5%, driven by higher equity market levels day count and $20 billion of net inflows. FX trading was down 13% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter mainly due to lower market volatility.","Securities finance revenues were down 18% year-on-year, largely reflecting the CCAR-related balance sheet optimizations made in the second half of 2018, but up 7% quarter-on-quarter due mainly to seasonal activity. In regards to the CCAR-related business actions taken last year, we've now made some trade structure changes to mitigate the CCAR counterparty limitations and are confident that we are creating room for incremental capacity for growth going forward.","Finally, processing fees were up year-on-year, reflecting approximately $86 million in revenue contribution from CRD. Quarter-on-quarter processing fees were down 12%, driven by the absence of prior quarter onetime items and lower revenue recognition in CRD.","Moving to slide 8. You'll see in the top left panel a summary of CRD's operating performance in 2Q 2019, generating $91 million of revenues and $46 million of operating expenses, resulting in $45 million of pre-tax income.","The business also saw a $31 million in new client bookings during the quarter including significant bookings from our asset management and asset servicing units, which will drive important deal synergies.","While CRD continues to perform well, I would remind you that the lumpiness inherited in the 606 revenue reporting standard and to not read across any one quarter's results.","Turning to the upper-right panel on this page, we wanted to again provide you an update on our active client discussions. As you can see here, our client discussions continue to advance. We're now actively engaged with approximately 140 clients, representing approximately $40 trillion in assets.","As anticipated these dialogues are resulting in a variety of revenue opportunities and we remain confident in the revenue and cost synergy goals announced at the time of the acquisition. On the bottom two panels of the page we've also listed some of the growth and synergy milestones achieved this quarter.","As I mentioned earlier in the call, our new front-to-back agreement with Lazard Asset Management is an important milestone and reflects as a sort of new growth opportunities envisioned when we acquired CRD. We currently have a strong front-to-back pipeline and are currently in exclusive negotiations with several clients and expect more announcements to come.","Turning to slide 9, NII was down 7% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter with our NIM declining eight and 16 basis points, respectively. In regards to NII, the decline on a sequential basis was primarily driven by the level of mix for deposit balances as well as our lower long-end rates have resulted in higher than usual MBS premium amortization and lower reinvestment yields.","In terms of client deposit behavior this quarter as expected, we continue to see a mix shift out of noninterest-bearing deposits in an amount similar to what we saw the last quarter and much of the quarterly rate in 2018.","At the same time we'd note that our average total deposits were up slightly quarter-on-quarter as we saw some lift from our deposit initiatives though some came at higher rates.","In terms of our balance sheet priorities going forward, we have a series of additional deposit initiatives underway including efforts to drive diversity of our deposit base and ongoing client share of wallet discussions to drive deposit balance growth. These initiatives supported our average total deposit balances this quarter and we're confident that there are incremental opportunities available going forward. And on the other -- on the earning asset side, we continue to target careful growth in client lending while modestly increasing the size of our investment portfolio.","Now, turning to expenses. As Ron emphasized in his remarks, we continue to be laser focused on expense management in this challenging revenue environment. And we're executing on a number of expense initiatives designed to generate durable efficiency and productivity gains every year.","On slide 10, we've again provided a view of expenses this quarter ex notable and seasonal items, so that the underlying trends are readily visible. Year-on-year, our underlying expenses excluding notable items and seasonally deferred compensation were up 2% but down 1% excluding CRD and flat quarter-on-quarter.","As you can see this result was again achieved across almost every major line of the expense base with information systems and communications where we continue to make technology infrastructure investments effectively the only expense line that saw a material growth ex CRD.","The hiring fees implemented earlier this year combined with the ongoing reduction in our senior ranks has also resulted in two consecutive quarters of total headcount declines with our total headcount down 1% quarter-on-quarter and 2% year-to-date. We are now harnessing the benefits of previous automation initiatives across more and more operational processes while we deliver higher and higher service quality.","Moving to slide 11. We are pleased with how we turned the corner on expenses over the last year. And to provide more color on where we've realized expense reductions to date and where we see incremental opportunities going forward.","Starting with the stacked bar chart on the left, we've provided a few of our underlying expenses categorized by IT, operations, as well as business segments and corporate functions. As you can see due to our cost management efforts for 2019, we expect to achieve year-on-year expense declines in two of these three segments with significant efficiencies realized in operations as well as reductions in our business and corporate functions.","That said, the growth in our IT cost is currently too high. And as Ron mentioned we have embarked on a top-to-bottom review of our technology cost structure. We see an opportunity to intervene on our technology infrastructure costs while investing in core business functionality and continuing to invest in resiliency.","Turning to the right-hand side of the page with the various resource discipline and process reengineering initiatives we have underway, we expect to continue to see headcount come down over the coming quarters and believe that we can further reduce our high cost location headcount by an additional 800 beyond our target to a total of approximately 2,300 in 2019 albeit while delivering quality service as we automate processes.","We are committed to simplifying our operations and technology model. We currently support an application intense IT architecture, which we need to consolidate with a goal of driving cost reduction including an initial rationalization of 10% of our applications globally by the end of this year. But we believe there is more that we can do. We are now ruthlessly assessing every development program against straight payback criteria while investing in client functionality.","Taken together, we now see our 2019 expense plan yielding an additional $50 million savings by the end of 2019, totaling $400 million for the year and resulting in a 1.5% reduction in our underlying expense base year-on-year excluding notable items and CRD as compared to the 1% target identified earlier this year.","Moving to slide 12. Our capital ratios were again largely consistent quarter-on-quarter with our standardized CET1 sitting at 11.4% and our Tier 1 leverage at 7.6%. We returned a total of approximately $475 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter, $300 million of which were share buybacks under our remaining authorization from the last CCAR cycle.","On the left side of the page, you can see that we consciously rebalanced our investment portfolio in 4Q 2018 and we're now holding a relatively higher percentage of HQLA, which has created significant CCAR-stressed capital capacity.","As you are aware, we are pleased with our 2019 CCAR results released last month and expect to increase our dividend to $0.52 per share beginning third quarter and to repurchase an incremental $2 billion of common stock through 2Q 2020, thus delivering on our priority to significantly increase capital return to our shareholders.","I would note that we are confident in our capital position. And as proposed changes the leverage ratio rules are finalized, we anticipate sharing a more fulsome perspective on our capital position and any associated optimizations opportunities going forward.","Before turning to slide 13, I would like to cover our third quarter outlook. On a sequential quarter basis, we expect servicing fees will be flattish and management fees will be up low single-digit. This assumes current equity index levels. While market revenues are always difficult to forecast, we currently expect them to take a seasonal step-down quarter-over-quarter given the summer months, similar to what we experienced last year.","Processing fees and others is expected to be down sequentially, but still within our quarterly guidance of $70 million to $80 million ex-CRD with CRD expected to be in the low 80s. In regards to NII, given the expectation of lower long rates continued rotation of deposits into interest-bearing and two rate cuts we currently expect sequential quarter NII to be down 1% to 3%.","And turning to expenses, we expect expenses ex-notable items to be flat on a sequential quarter basis including the CRD build. Finally, we expect to see the tax rate between 19% to 20% similar to our year-to-date tax rate.","Moving to our summary on page 13. While we remain unsatisfied with our revenue performance, we did see some moderation in servicing fee headwinds that helped result in flat total fee revenues quarter-on-quarter.","Moreover, the underlying expense reduction we've achieved to date demonstrates our ability to further bend the cost curve, as we've now reduced headcount 2% year-to-date, while also raising this year's expense savings target to $400 million. And we achieved a non-objection to our 2019 CCAR submission and we'll be able to deliver on our priority of increasing capital return to shareholders.","Finally, as Ron noted in his opening remarks, we'll be providing updates on our current business strategy and the results of our technology reassessment. We look forward to coming back to you in the fall with our progress.","And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning, Ron and Eric. How are you guys doing?","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Well, thanks Brennan.","Brennan Hawken","Just wanted to start out with the NII guide. Eric, thanks for providing that. But, just curious about what beta is embedded. I believe you referenced that did reflect two Fed fund cuts in the back half of the year. And so, how should we think about your expectations for beta that's embedded in there? And how should we think about what you are assuming for overall balance sheet growth and -- I know you referenced continued -- I think you referenced continued non-interest-bearing rotation, but about just overall that deposit balance growth? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Thanks, Brennan. Let me give you the kind of the components and maybe some direction on each one of them. Because as you know, the NII -- the direction of NII is dependent on several different features that we've been working through both as an industry and as a bank. So first, we do expect continued rotation of net interest -- non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing deposits that is expected to continue and we'll wait to some extent on NII. We're seeing long rates down relative to where they were this past quarter where they've been over the last couple of years and so is the reinvestment cycles from the investment portfolio you see some downward progression.","And in contrast, you also see I think some modest expansion in the asset earning side of the book right investment -- the investment securities balances are up modestly, we're continuing to grow lending in a disciplined manner and those will provide some uptick.","When it comes specifically to deposit betas we're almost at an equilibrium point. If you think about it early in the rate cycle, the deposit betas were quite low and so as the Fed raised rates there was a significant tailwind within NII for us and other banks and the betas were in the 10% 20% range. They floated upright to the 40% to 50% range and now 60% to 70% range.","And so in effect as the Fed moves 25 basis points up, if it were to do that had it originally anticipated, right there wouldn't have been much uptick in NII. And similarly as it now anticipates and is within our expectations that it actually moves down, the betas are similarly at that higher level. And so deposits rates will naturally come down reasonably quickly for the first move or so.","I think what -- and that's I kind of say we're at an equilibrium point with betas effectively covering or being neutral with respect to the Fed rate change. I think what's uncertain is what happens after the first rate change for the second third or other movements and that we've got to see.","But anyway hopefully that's enough to give you some color on a second quarter the third quarter basis. And obviously, we'll continue to provide some texture as rates evolve.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then thanks for the update on the expense outlook. It's really encouraging to see some more assertive movements there. When we think about the $8.43 billion that you've provided for operating expenses is that comparable to the $8.27 billion which you previously provided which I believe excluded the CRD expenses? And how much of that lower expectation is in the first half 2019 results as in already reported? And how much is still on to come? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Let me do that in kind of in a fulsome way. So, the progress on the expense program has been I think quite good. We've logged $175 million year-to-date. We are -- and that was out of $350 million that we additionally anticipated and that's why we have a lot of confidence in being able to hit not only that initial target by taking it up -- but taking it up.","And I think what we've seen is we've seen a real progress in addressing some of our prior year growth in headcount. And that's effectively what we're reversing because we're growing headcount at 4% to 5% a year for several years. And as a result while we were automating and I think you've finally seen us begin to do in an industrious way is actually now ensure that the automation is actually used it's used consistently in a widespread way. And that is part of what our COO described at one of the recent conferences on how we're scaling the use of the automation tools.","And once you do that you actually need fewer people in the mix and you actually deliver even better and higher levels of service and quality because the processes effectively are straight through.","On the overall expense guide, for the year, we've done it apples-to-apples relative to 2018. I think Brennan we're quite clear in the footnote that it's -- you see that the underlying expenses are ex notable items and CRD-related expenses. And so if there is some specific question you have versus some other numbers that you've seen just, we can follow-up offline and kind of do this. We can effectively help you all model this with and without CRD if that's helpful for you. But this is on a what I'll describe as a what I think is really an apples-to-apples way to think about the expense base.","Brennan Hawken","And then just sorry the last point about how much of that lower expectation is already reported. Is the difference -- is the right way to think about the difference just be $175 million that you've already done versus now the $400 million is the new target therefore you've got $225 million left to go versus your prior expectations? Is it that simple?","Eric Aboaf","Yes. Yes that's exactly. Yes and because of the run rate at which we're operating in the second quarter the amount of the I think we're ahead of plan as I've said on some of our headcount changes. For example we had described that we had targeted 1500 reductions in high-class location headcount for the year.","We've already gotten to 1800 in just in the first six months so we're ahead of the plan there. And that kind of run rate benefit is what is we feel confident will give us the full year savings of the $400 million.","Brennan Hawken","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alex Blostein","Great. Hi. Good morning, everybody. So I was hoping to start with a question around the servicing business. Eric, obviously you mentioned that the pricing pressure you've seen over the last couple of quarters is starting to moderate. Obviously, it's a pretty important sign for investors given the pressures we've seen in that line item. Can we expand on that a little bit? I guess, historically you talked about sort of 2%-ish annual sort of pricing decline for servicing. Sounds like recently it's been running closer to 1% this quarter you expect that to persist for the next couple of quarters. But, are we through the worst of it? How should we think about pricing pressure sort of beyond 2019? In other words like given the changes that you guys might have made is 1% pricing compression kind of the run rate? Or should we think about that normalizing back to 2% or so that we've seen historically?","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Alex, this is Ron. Why don't I start and Eric can pick up. I think what we're seeing is as we'd said now for a couple of quarters. We've been in this period of almost extraordinary price pressure. This is a business that's always had a price downturn kind of built into it, and we would expect that kind of secular element to remain. But there's been unusual price pressure really driven by primarily the pressure on the actual asset managers and asset owners themselves, and then looking for some relief through their large providers such as ourselves.","Secondarily, I think it was somewhat driven by when you had the big run-up in the markets in 2016 and 2017 and clients would look and see, gee, I just wrote a check to you guys it was 20% more than the check last year, it seems like we have to get some of this back. So what we're saying \u2013 what we're seeing is the moderation of that, what I call that extraordinary price pressure.","Part of it is, we've worked our way through many of the clients. We've also gotten some term out of it. But also we've gone about it, we said, we were changing the way we are going about re-pricing and we've done that. That used to be a relatively routine decentralized kind of decision here. And for any individual RM, it might be something that he or she experiences one or two times every couple of years. So we kind of brought that expertise in centrally. We've been reasonably successful in things like extending term and getting more business. And most importantly, matching the price \u2013 any price decrease \u2013 any in-ordinary price decrease we're giving to incremental business coming in as opposed to the price decrease first and the business later.","So what I would say kind of from a qualitative basis is you can expect this business to continue to be price competitive and that there will be ongoing price pressure, but that we are seeing moderation in that extraordinary element of re-pricing driven both by the fact that we've accomplished a lot of it already; and secondly our own actions in mitigating the effects of it.","Eric Aboaf","And Alex, it's Eric. Let me just add some of the quantitative kind of beacons to that, right? So, the history here is that, this business operated over the last, I'll say decade, with normal fee headwinds of about 1.5% to 2%, so call it 2%, to keep things straightforward. During 2018 that ticked-up to about 4% for the full year, and we saw about \u2013 we expect about 4% this year as well to play through the revenue line. What we're starting to see is that \u2013 and that 4% is effectively a percentage point each quarter, right? Now it comes a little \u2013 it tends to come a little sharper in the first quarter, and then a little lighter in the second, third and fourth quarter.","And as we've \u2013 you can imagine devoured our own data client-by-client and area-by-area, what we're starting to see is that sequential amounts of pricing that are hitting us are starting to moderate. And as Ron describes, we're through not only a majority of the discussions, but closer to three quarters of this kind of what I'll describe as an unusual, or larger than usual wave. As that \u2013 those hit the revenue accruals, it feels like the \u2013 the peak quarter was in the \u2013 or the peak time period was towards the end of the first quarter. And we \u2013 our expectation is that this is beginning to normalize back to some level.","So we're trying to be quite transparent with you about what we're seeing. We've got some amount of visibility into what will likely happen with fee pressure in the third quarter and fourth quarter, right? Because those are all our large clients, we know where we may have opened negotiations and so forth, and we can tabulate those. And so that's what gives us some confidence that, we're seeing some of \u2013 some signs of moderation here. I think what \u2013 we all want to be careful of this as the 4% year-on-year that we saw last year that we expect this year, the pace of that coming down, we're seeing it start to moderate. Does it come down to 3% year-on-year after being at 4% year-on-year?","That's what we'd like to see and we expect to have more visibility into that as we move further in the year. And then, ideally it comes back down to some normalized level. And that's what where we need to -- we'd like to see, but we also need to work forward in finding ways, as Ron described, to balance some of our actions. And, I think, we'll learn more in the coming quarters.","Alex Blostein","Go it. Thanks for that. That's pretty clear. Secondly, wanted to follow up on CRD. Looks like the order intake or sort of the new bookings you guys described in the quarter was around $31 million. And I'm just trying to think about how should we think about that flowing through into the model. Does that kind of hit you all in the subsequent quarter or over some period of time?","And then, the pipeline around the front-to-back initiatives that you highlighted, obviously, one will be Lazard, but also the ones that haven't hit yet. How should we be thinking about the economics of that pipeline growing? And not sure if you guys could describe it in terms of, like, AUM times the fee rate, or some sort of frame of reference on how we should think about the revenues of that opportunity?","Eric Walter","Let me describe it from two different angles, Alex. When we did our diligence on CRD and then decided to pursue the deal and shared that with you, we described that this business was growing at about 7% top line over the last few years. And our expectation is that we should be on the CRD-specific revenue lines be able to double that.","And we're quite confident that we've started to get that level of growth in that business. And that's kind of one way to think about what we're beginning to deliver. And part of that, literally, comes from it being owned by a large parent who's been in business for a couple of centuries as opposed to a couple of years and the willingness of clients to sign on. So that's one way to think of it and we've got quite a bit of confidence that we're seeing that kind of lift.","I think on a tactical basis, what you saw this quarter and what you'll see in various quarters is the bookings. The bookings are, we describe, on a run rate revenue basis, just to give you a sense for size. Those bookings tend to begin to get implemented and roll through an implementation timeframe of 6, 9, 12 months. So it takes some amount of time.","And then, I just remind you that we were clear that the bookings this quarter did have a larger, obviously, spike. And two of those bookings -- I think we're actually pleased it was to our actually internal bookings with -- one with our asset management business, right, where they're now rolling out CRD in substantial portions in operations. And the other one, which is our servicing business, where the CRD systems are effectively replacing an old compliance engine that we used to offer through our custody servicing business.","And if you think about it, on one hand, those revenues will be eliminated in consolidation. On the other hand, those revenues actually lead to direct expense synergies, because had we not implemented CRD in such a, I think, fulsome way, we would have been on those legacy platforms on those -- on that patchwork of the 25 systems that we've described for the typical large asset manager.","And so we're actually quite pleased that we can effectively lead with our own implementations, which becomes a model, right, for what Charles River can do, because if you can implement Charles River on an asset manager of a couple of trillion dollars of assets over time, right, then it proves its power and effectiveness in a broad range of different scenarios.","Alex Blostein","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks. Question on securities portfolio. I know I'm over generalizing it. But when credit risk assets were super tight, low rates and tight spreads, you made the switch over to some mortgages got unlucky and, who know, rates fell 50 basis points and they prepaid on you. So my question is, now what do you do? You expect some balance growth, you expect some loan growth. What do you do on the asset side as the balance sheet grows? Because the rate and spread picture hasn't changed all that much.","Eric Walter","Hey, Glenn, it's Eric. The bankers have always had these challenges. As you have rate cycles going up, there are opportunities as rates come down. The opportunities tend to be fewer then. As rates invert, there's an even different way to operate. So I don't think there are any silver bullets that I would put out there or any other CFO or treasurer would share with you.","I think what we technically do in this environment is where we have excess liquidity and we are a liquidity-rich bank we continue to add to the securities portfolio. We do that and effectively on balances. And you've seen our securities portfolio went up a couple of billion dollars this quarter, and we've got capacity to continue to do that in the coming quarters. And that provides some yields and effectively puts some cash to work.","We do that selectively in the agency MBS space, or in the very high-grade credit space, or some of the foreign jurisdictions each of those are tactical choices that we'll make depending on the relative value opportunities. And then I think coincident with that the other part of the asset yield part of the book is that we continue to grow our lending franchise. We don't have a large lending franchise by typical bank standards, and we think that's not inappropriate for a custody bank.","On the other hand, our capital call financing business, which is a real area of growth and connectivity with our clients, continues to grow at a very attractive pace as the alternative lenders are all out there building bigger and bigger funds, and it's one which operated quite well during the crisis. And so that kind of capital call financing, the 40 Act leverage fund financing all have very good risk-return dynamics. I think we see some opportunities there, but like anyone we want to stick to what we're good at, and what our clients do given where we are in the cycle. So, anyway, hopefully, that's a little bit of a texture at this point on the price.","Glenn Schorr","Yes. Thanks. Yes. One last one. The $575 billion of one but not yet funded, can you give any color in terms of what we should think about in terms of timing working its way into the pipeline and impact on fees?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. Each one of those is different, it's literally a composite. The largest the wins in there were in the insurance sector. And I think we've talked to you about our becoming more industrious in some of the sub-segments outside of asset managers, where we're already strong, but I don't think we've emphasized our expansion much as we did in the asset manager segment, which has historically been our kind of core.","So there's some insurance wins, there's some asset management wins, there's -- it's a pool. It's hard to directly anticipate the exact on-boarding, but it tends to be six months, 12 months, sometimes 15 months, it just takes time. And in a way it works is the simpler stuff can get done, custodies sometimes get done in six months, but more complex accounting or middle office is 12 months to 18 months.","So to us it's a sign that we're out there selling and driving client activity. And part of what we know we need to do is we know we need to continue to drive that client activity as a way to restart the revenue growth that we need to deliver to all of you. So we're trying to also be, I think, more transparent of some of the indicators. And that's one of several indicators, but one we thought -- that we've held for that this quarter.","Glenn Schorr","Thanks, Eric.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning. Eric just one follow-up on the -- on balance sheet. Can you just remind us just how faster the securities portfolio repricing? And within -- and where is the duration stand today after some of the recent changes in the investments? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. Ken the duration is at about just over 2.5 years, it's been in the 2.5 years to three years, I think for the last few quarters if not the last couple years. The -- and so it kind of tractors in concert with that average duration.","I think the other way to think about it and we've tried to be helpful in our disclosures in the Qs and Ks that as you have movements in long rates say the 10-year treasury that comes back and impacts our NII. And I think the rough -- maybe a rough rule of thumb might be for every basis points change in the 10-year rate, that's worth about $1 million a year. So you can multiply that out for 25 basis points what it would be worth or 50, and that's part of the down drift that we've started to see through first and second quarter, and we just need to be sensitive to.","So if Fed cuts rates, that's we think -- that will have one impact. If the curve picks up maybe a little steepness as it does that we'll see. That would be constructive if the curve stays flat or inverts that can move around the yield for us and other banks.","Ken Usdin","Got it. And then my second question, Eric, you guys had the very successful CCAR result, you burned meaningfully less that than last year, 208 basis points better. So that didn't obviously effect this year's CCAR but you did -- do a good job in boosting as expected buyback. Can you talk about your views on where the plan proposals are on SLR SCB et cetera? And if the results of this year's CCAR might let you be more aggressive looking ahead or on capital returns? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Sure, Ken. It's Eric. And let me do this one in stages, because I think as the Fed governors have said there's about 24 different capital metrics that banks operate under and so it has a series of different steps. I think first as you described, we're very pleased with our CCAR results this year. And a lot of that was some of the actions that we took in the investment portfolio. We literally created several billion dollars of room under CCAR and ended up with as we shifted that investment portfolio out of credit. So that was the first stage.","And I think what that effectively demonstrate is under a CCAR-type stress, we have room for -- we have room in the capital account. So that's certainly a first step. The second step is then what are the next most important binding capital constraints and what happens if the CCAR downdraft isn't -- the stress isn't the constraint. Then you go back to what are our spot levels of capital ratio. And those spot levels are on that page 12 of our deck.","And if you go through the different spot levels, what you will find is that as a custody bank the leverage ratio and specially the supplementary leverage ratio under the spot rules of 5% for the Holdco, 6% for the bank, are what becomes the next most binding capital constraints, and so the assessment then is how much space do we have there. And I think what happens -- what we're now looking at is what happens with some of the Fed changes in the -- and the SLR that have come out of the Congressional bill that's out for comment, those comments I think concluded just a few weeks ago. And now the Feds got to turn that into a rule and based on that and the timing of that rule is certainly that frees up and could free up some capital capacity under SLR.","And then after that we go to the next most important binding constraint, is it CET1? What happens with the SCB? What happens with Basel IV and so on and so forth? So think of it as a waterfall. I think why we're optimistic and I described a little bit of that in my prepared remarks is, we've very effectively created room under stress. We think there is a path some more room under the supplementary leverage ratio. And we'll all learn more about that in the coming months or quarter or two. And then what we can do is, we'll go back and think about our capital stack, right. Because we're looking at CET1 opportunities that's one potential pool, you all know that we have about three points of alternative Tier 1 in the form of preferreds, that's another larger than usual pool for banks. But as a custody bank that has been down by the leverage ratios that was important to have at the time. And obviously there is the Tier 2.","And so what it effectively does is, I'm trying to give you a bit of a roadmap so to speak how we think about the opportunities but that's the process and then it's around the whole capital stack, and where there are opportunities and that we can -- that we could have appropriately shared back with you and our investors.","Ken Usdin","Got it. That\u2019s a lot of color. Thanks, Eric.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning.","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","You dug a lot into the expenses in the trajectory. And I just wanted to understand when I'm thinking about the pretax margin improvement of 200 basis points that you're looking for. How you're thinking about the drivers of that in terms of a little bit bigger picture in the sense of how much of that 200 basis points you're expecting is going to be coming from expenses versus revenues, just given the inputs that you have right now today?","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Betsy why don't I start that, I mean, ideally what you would like to see is a little bit of both. But we are cautious enough about the revenue environment that we feel we need to keep doubling down on expenses. We want to do that wisely because we have to do that while continuing to ensure that our client service remains at high levels. And that we are investing in the business. But the way we think about it now particularly given the downdraft that we experienced at the end of last year and the ongoing fee pressure that we've had is that expenses will be the first move in terms of improving that margin and that the revenue actions that we're taking as well as the longer-term revenue that's going to flow in as a result of this front-to-back work, we'll then provide some of that margin uplift later. So conceptually, that's where we think about it.","In terms of timing, we're standing by our goals there. But obviously, the world changed a lot from when we put those goals out late last year. So, that's why we've been very cautious with you in terms of really going quarter-to-quarter as we can -- so we can try and get a picture of what's going on the revenue side. And so, we can focus on what we know we can control which is expenses.","Eric Aboaf","And Betsy, it's Eric. I would just add that a part of what we're doing is to continue to work through more and more of the expense base. One of the reasons, we shared with you the page on full year expenses in the earnings deck is to actually show you where we are in that process and where we've made more progress and where we feel like there's a lot more opportunity.","And I think, you see in particular, as we've automated a lot of more and more of our work and force utilization of some of our automation tools, you see that year-on-year 8% anticipated reduction in operations. And that's exactly what should do as we automate a factory it -- the costs go down and you'd expect that we want to continue that process year after year after year.","I think, to some extent, we've made some good headway in our businesses and functions and there's always more we want to do there. But I think we're on a good path relative to the past. And more to come and in those it's really -- its personal expense and its non-personal expense and each one of those has opportunities.","And then finally, I think technology cost is the area where we've made a decision more recently and part of it comes as merge operations and technology together under a COO and part of it comes with the realization and a decision here at the top that we can't live given the revenue environment with the kind of technology, cost structure and growth that we've been operating under. And so, that's why we've said top to bottom, we're going to address opportunities, find opportunities and more to come as that review proceeds.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thanks. And then just Eric, I know we had a conversation earlier about the securities. But we just wanted to round that out with, at this stage, do you see any opportunities for restructuring, securities book positioning or you feel like, where it is right now is optimized for your current rate outlook?","Eric Aboaf","Betsy, I think the securities book is in a pretty good position overall. I think we'll always do some adjustments around the margin. Rates are lower. We can always if we wanted get out of some securities and buy back others. So, I think we have some latitude which is convenient, but I think generally, we like the mix now of the securities portfolio. I think selectively and tactically we'll want to maintain duration. We've lost a little bit of duration as we've had rates come down and you have the natural prepayments work their way through. So, we tactically add that back. And then as I said, I think, we want to find ways selectively to expand the securities portfolio because it provides good yields for us at least as a custody bank. And that's part of the -- of some of our anticipated actions.","Betsy Graseck","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Mike Carrier","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Eric, may be first one, I think you mentioned there's some more balancing capacity for CET1 and I think maybe FX, do you see the demand by clients given some of the repositioning that you did last year. Just -- are you seeing that demand? And how soon could we see some growth in those areas?","Eric Aboaf","Mike, the answer is that there is demand out there. There are opportunities for us and I think we have found ways to create capacity. I think the question that comes around the pace of that growth and that takes some time. And I think, part of the reason is, as we implemented some of our constraints and caps that came out of the CCAR counterparty task, in some cases we actually had to reduce activity with some clients or put some constraints on. And as you do that, right clients appropriately say, all right, fine, I understand, but when you then go back to them after having created room and doing some of the diversification of counterparty optimizations and the innovations and I've described some trade structure refinements, those clients are delighted that you're back open for business. But they also come back over time, right? Because it's about then serving them even better than their current providers about shifting where they place their wallet. And so I think it takes quarters to -- for it to build and part of what we\u2019d like to see is that and we'll report on is that build as it comes. It's also a little lumpy because you got the seasonal effects of 2Q and agency lending and enhanced custody and then a seasonal summer months that work the other way in third quarter.","But we'll try to provide as much of a window into that evolution. But I think the point we did want to make is that we found ways to create capacity here and so it's a matter of time now for us and for our business teams to execute.","Mike Carrier","Okay. That's helpful. And then just quickly on the strategy in tech just the reassessment ahead and the update in the fall. Just as that expectation it sounds like it's focused on cost. But I just want to make sure there is that -- anything on like the innovative or growth with partners, just want to make sure you've got any set expectations in terms of what initiatives you guys are thinking and when we'll get an update on?","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Yeah, Mike its Ron. We\u2019re thinking comprehensively about this, clearly cost is on our mind. But it's also about how do we get to market as rapidly as possible. How do we innovate as rapidly as possible, as tech changes how do we substitute as rapidly as possible? So we're thinking about this comprehensively. And I don't have to tell you that world has changed in tech.","And as we have moved our applications to be much more comprehensive and covering the full range of activities from front to back and if you think about our front-office system it's highly -- you're highly focused on the user interface. You think about our back-office system, you're talking about transaction speed and basically invulnerability if you will and high amounts of resiliency.","So we haven't really done that kind of broad-based reassessment. It's already started. It's not going to take months, I mean it will take a few months but it's not going to take many months. And we'll come back to you and keep you updated on what we're thinking about.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Jim Mitchell","Hey good morning. Maybe just -- now that you're close to reality with front-to-back contract with a client. How do we think about the pricing because I think there was concerns initially that you -- that some of the parts would be less than the separate part? So are you seeing is pricing holding up and\/or is it -- so is it revenue-accretive margin in terms of the fee rate? Is it -- or is it more margin-accretive because it's more efficient? How do we think about as you build this business the impact on revenue and margin?","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Yeah Jim, the way I would think about it is that our intention had always been and so far we've been succeeding on this to not let this become just a throw away or an add-on for custody business. And that -- those have actually been pretty easy conversations. And that's actually not what the client is focused on, what the client is focused on here is, how do I simplify my own operations? How do I actually reduce my own cost? And how do I get access to data more quickly and be able to rely on that data?","So those have been the key buying factors. I mean certainly there\u2019s a cost element to this but we're not seeing it kind of come back into the CRD used to be priced at X and we want to price it at some fraction of X.","The second thing I would point out is, as we had said from the earliest days on CRD and when we rolled out the front-to-back strategy these clients that we're talking to and there's several that are in advanced negotiations, exclusive negotiations there are all sorts of flavors. Some of them are already CRD and State Street clients, so if you will we're putting together the final mile.","At the other extreme there is an \u2013 there\u2019s a perspective client in there. We had no relationship with them. I mean, we knew who they were, they knew who we were. But we did not have an existing relationship but they had this need that we've described.","So the nature of that will be if it comes to fruition is that we'd expect to see new custody, new accounting and new CRD as a result of that. So there's two elements to your question, one, is kind of pricing, but the second element is what's the content and nature the business? And in some cases we're filling out the wallet if you will. In other cases the wallet is opening up to us for the first time and we're taking the whole thing.","Jim Mitchell","Right, okay. That's helpful. And then maybe Eric just pivoting on to deposits. If I look at your queue, a 100 basis point short in shock. It's actually pretty neutral based on disclosures. Is that still the best way to think about it? If you have the long-end staying where it is and we get some cuts, is it pretty neutral to NII? Is that still fair?","Eric Aboaf","Jim it's Eric. I think the way we would describe it is that the short-end change of rates in the U.S. in particular is roughly neutral for the first 25 basis points. I think after that, it starts to have a negative impact, right? And why would that be? It's because if the rate -- if rates were to come down 75 a 100 basis points, you start to get compressed against the lower bound on the deposit cost. And so there is a -- the convexity, the stair-step actually matters here. And so that's important to factor in.","And then I think the other one is the currency dynamic and we'll continue to add more currency information in some of those disclosures. So you could see what happens if the U.S. moves down. I think there's a big question mark in my mind is that what's going to happen in Europe. And that environment given the change in central bank leadership and some of the other economic growth changes that we're seeing. So anyway, hopefully that gives you some color. I think the first one should be neutral, after that there's, you get back to that more expanded situation that we need to work through.","Jim Mitchell","That's fair. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Brian Bedell","Thanks very much. A lot of my questions are answered. I just have one two-part question on the cost side. Just looking at slide 11 and slide 17 to the cost guidance for 2018 and 2019 on an underlying basis and then looking at that versus the appendix. I see the 8.57 for 2018, but if I add up 1Q 2019 and 2Q 2019 on the same basis, your 8.43 would have imply a 3% increase in the second half on that basis versus the first half. So I just wanted to verify if I am doing the right apples-to-apples there?","And then the second part of the question is as we get through the cost saves, shouldn't we be coming into -- in 4Q at a lower endpoint? And as we move into 2020, especially with some of the reengineering ideas you talked about Ron, should we be looking at a lower expense trajectory on a year-over-year basis in 2020 versus 2019?","Eric Aboaf","Brian, let me start. I think on the specifics that you just went through, we probably hopefully just cover that as a follow-up. I think that was quite clear that third quarter expenses ex-notable and lumpy items will be well-controlled. And I think you can expect that we like expenses to be either flat or trending down and that'll be the case on a quarterly basis. I do think and it's a little early for us to do our planning for next year, but given the revenue environment, as Ron and I have described, we need to double down on expenses given the -- given our commitments and our intentions to find ways to widen margin and improve ROE.","And we do the same kind of things that you're thinking through, which is, what's our run rate at the -- in the third quarter versus the first, what's our run rate in the fourth quarter versus the first. And that's exactly what we should be doing. And why we've been I think pleased that we've gotten our headcount now under much better control. We've gotten some of our off shoring activities to -- at pace, because the second half of the year run rate as a fourth quarter run rate will be more indicative of what we can deliver in next year.","And then there's obviously the hard work we need to do as to what can we do over and above that and we always want to find more we can do. And we were industrious this year. We need to be industrious next year. We also need to offset whatever the natural headwinds of merit and so forth. So there's a lots going in that, but we're certainly the same mind that I think you're intimating, which is how do you take advantage of the benefits and do that to -- and how do you tackle expenses year after year after year, because it's an industry in which we need to do that. That's got to be the operating mode that we use.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Great. Thank you. I'll follow-up offline on the detail. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Your line is now open.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. I had two kind of specific questions. One is, when we talk about the net interest income impact this particular quarter, we're excited at the accelerated premium amortization. When I look at the actual sequential decline of $60 million, there's just not a way for the long-term portfolio to reprice in a normal way to generate that much pressure. So it seems like to me that this premium amortization was a pretty big deal this particular quarter. And sometimes that could be a catch-up.","So I'm just curious, how much of the $60 million sequential decline was related to that premium amortization. And then, if rate stay flat, long-term rates, not short-term rates, obviously they would be headed nowhere. But if long-term rates kind of stabilize at their relative position today, what does that mean for that particular amortization number going into the next couple of quarters?","Eric Aboaf","Marty it's Eric. Let me first give a little decomposition then we'll talk about the coming quarters. So, the decomposition on a quarter-on-quarter basis was that a little less than half of the $60 million reduction in NII came from the premium amortization a little less than half came from the rotation noninterest-bearing deposits and interest-bearing deposits. And then there was another little stuff from just general reduction in rates and some other more minor impacts. So, that gives you a little bit of color.","I think what has happened here and the reason why there was an acceleration is that part of what we did as we rotated out of credit last fall when prevailing long rates were at 3%, 3.10%, 3.15% is we were in some higher coupon bonds. And some of those pay very good rates and as you have the fallen rates you have the acceleration. So, that's what played through.","I think some of that is burning out. And so then you get a residual set of bonds at good rates. And so its amount is about working through that. As we look into third quarter, there's a couple of different features happening. There is still some amount of premium amortization that will come through. And so we -- there'll be a bit more in the third quarter and then it begins to tell from there assuming long rates stay where they are.","And then what we also have in the third quarter is just the general level of rates and the reinvestment yields and that kind of tractor that I described earlier come through. And so that's playing out as well. The offset to some of that is the some modest growth in the size of the portfolio some modest growth in loans.","And that should help and then obviously the deposit dynamics will probably be the larger of the pieces going into the third quarter. What we try to do is kind of knit that together and give you some range of guidance to be able to estimate the -- a bit of the third quarter.","Marty Mosby","So, what -- I did hear you say is that $30 million there will be some of that left to come into the third quarter, but by the time we get to the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year, at least, if rates don't decline further, that $30 million negative goes away and NII would get the benefit from that?","Eric Aboaf","Yes. It gets a -- it starts to -- exactly it starts to attenuate, right? It gets you have less of it towards the fourth quarter and the first quarter. But remember you always have a certain amount of prepayments floating through a mortgage book that's always been in our numbers. We've always operated with a certain amount. And it could be helpful.","There's some good disclosure in the 10-Q on the amount of premium, the premium amortization and we can take you through some of the -- kind of the waves that you should expect for us or for any bank.","Marty Mosby","Okay. And then the other very particular thing I wanted to hone in on was in the back end of the fee income you talked about CRD revenue due to revenue recognition standards.","Just was curious what you meant by revenue recognition standards? What is that is that? Is that a seasonal thing? Is that a shift that you had a business and now you're understanding it better so you changed the standards I just was curious what that meant?","Eric Aboaf","No, that's just it. There was industry-wide change to the accounting. It's I think ASC 605 going to ASC 606, I've got to make sure I double check my acronym. So, I'll do that as a follow-up with our controller. That went into effect I guess about a year and a half ago. And it affects the software-oriented businesses that also affected our management our asset management business.","And it's quite prescriptive on how revenue is recognized. And so for fast implementations the revenue is recognized in quite a I'll call it a natural way. But from on-premise installations at the contract renewal point, you literally have to -- that particular quarter of a contract renewal you have to record x percent and we can again get you some of the details of the entire contract.","And it ends up with lumpy revenues even though you're effectively providing the service over a period of time. I mean we agree with the accounting literature and it's probably more consistent way to do the revenue recognition accounting for the industry, but it just ends up with lumpiness because of the way contracts are structured.","Marty Mosby","And that's not seasonal or anything there's no realm or reason to it it's just going to be how you're onboarding new relationships or different things that are happening within the I guess the actual recognition of that revenue is the activities?","Eric Aboaf","Correct. It's the onboarding of new, but it's also the as existing contract cycle through when they -- when the contract renewal state is ends up lumpy and they're not all stacked up in that kind of perfectly even way during the year.","So, it will just go up and down. We're just going to we what we want to do is be clear that we -- the underlying revenues, I think we're trying to be clear about the GAAP revenues are the most appropriate \u2013 obviously a way to measure. They'll be lumpy and you just wanted to take over the course of several quarters, or over a year to actually see the numbers in a way that are more intuitive.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. And lastly, a bigger picture question. When you all mentioned earlier that the pricing pressure accelerated, which have started to make sense it started to really become much more crystal-clear. In other words, market valuations are gone up so much over the last decade that as you price to those market valuations, that are really not increasing the activities, or work that you're doing for customer, and your customers are getting under pressure. So their revenues per assets under management are going down. They're going to kind of turn to you, and say, well look you're not really doing that much more work for us, but yeah, we've paying you that much more. I think you mentioned the 20% price increase the kind \u2013 just as a \u2013 just kind of a example.","So, is there any thought or process where you could get away from being per assets where market valuation would kind of roll around versus being tied more to transactions and activities and more like a cash management type of relationship where you pay for processing versus paying for the amount that you have, which is dictated by market valuations. In the past, it made a lot of sense, because they got revenue on their assets so they could pay you on their asset, but that relationship is kind of busting up. So I just don't know, historically versus going forward, is there a way to disconnect from the market valuation and the AUM and get to transaction processing?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. Marty, it's Eric. You're \u2013 either all the \u2013 you're absolutely spot on in describing how this pricing has evolved in this industry. And I think we're having \u2013 we've got as a result broader and broader fee structures with our clients to make sure that there is a mix of flows and client activity and transactions which directly represents the kind of work we do. I think what keeps some of the history going, is that our large clients or the large asset managers and those large asset managers often get paid on a management fee basis, right? If you think about a mutual fund, which is market dependent.","So there's a bit of an interest in our clients tying their expenses to market level just like their fees are. We ideally like obviously charge for the service itself as you described. And so I think over time, there will be an evolution, but there is a range of interest here. And I think our view is, we just need to make sure, we're appropriately creating value for our clients. So that they \u2013 so that we can remunerate it appropriately. We find ways to do it in a way that \u2013 the more stable the better. And so those are the kinds of some of those areas that you described are the areas that we've been engaging on.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Rob Wildhack","Good morning, guys. Just one from me. Looking at the management fee line you mentioned again the shift towards the lower fee products. I was wondering \u2013 hoping to get some color on the velocity of that shift. Is that a trend that's been accelerating or decelerating in any discernable way? And then how do you think about that velocity going forward?","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Yeah. Rob, this is Ron. I think that, it's certainly something we're trying to manage and we're having some return on that effort here. So this year, for example, half of the new business SSGA has brought in has been outside of the traditional passive area, where we've seen the most price pressure. And we've \u2013 we applaud that kind of diversification. The realities are though in terms of where the flows are going.","So if you look for example at ETF flows, we had a \u2013 at the top level, I would describe it as a so-so quarter. But that was driven by continued market share gains in Europe and in low cost offset by really outflows in some of the big institutional products like spy. So this is \u2013 there's clearly a market shift going on particularly in ETFs, and you would find the same by the way, if you looked at some of our large ETF competitors. And where their flows are going, the preponderance is going, to these low-cost products as \u2013 and really what's behind that is a substitute for a higher cost, whether it's mutual funds and typically it's advisers that are employing these as building blocks. So we have to live with that. And that's why we have to, one, make sure we reduce our cost; and two, that we're opening up our distribution channels, so that we are continuing to gain share in those areas.","Rob Wildhack","Thanks, Ron, really helpful.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning. Ron, you mentioned about the competitive forces that many of your customers are under, which has led to pricing challenges for you and your peers. Can you just share with us your insights about the competition amongst the custody banks; especially some of the New York banks seem to be stepping up their intensity in competing in this business, because they've got diversified revenue source and this is an area that may be was not as much of the focus five years ago, but it seems to be today. But I'm interested in the competitive dynamics of your competitors and the pressure that puts on pricing.","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Yes, Gerard. If you look at the history of the universal banks in the space, it's been cyclical. There've been times where they're all in and there have been times when the business has languished. And I would say this is one of those periods in the cycle where they have been focused on it.","That is one of the things that drove us to re-examine our strategy a year, year-and-a-half ago. And to make the move that we did, rather than be forced into a position where we're all combating for the same back office stuff, that we wanted to make sure that we had the full range of back, middle and front office and to be able to offer a really integrated offering to them.","It changes the nature of the relationship; it changes the nature of the pricing discussion, even changes what the objective function is. I mean, if a client's out there is just building -- bidding out custody, it's not the custody, it's a commodity. There certainly are service differences, but it really is more price.","If a client is having or a prospective client is having a discussion with you on front to back, it's really about the next 10 years of their firm. And how are they going to build their firm in a way that they're going to be able to scale, that they're going to be able to manage their economics that they're going to be able to have better access to data to be able to: one, provide better investment outcomes; but two, better services their clients.","And we're the only ones that are in position to be able to do that. We're the only custody bank that has those services front to back. So we think we're having just a very different set of conversations. It doesn't mean we don't respect them. Our competitors are good. To survive this long in the asset-servicing space, it means that they you are good, but that's why it was important for us to differentiate our offering.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And as a follow-up, for a number of years State Street and even some of your competitors have talked about an ongoing expense savings programs, improving technology, obviously, it's underway right now at State Street. Is there anyway that we, as outsiders, can measure how successful the integration of technology is into your day-to-day operations?","Or can you create a metric, I don't know, if it's is the percentage of actions taken by humans versus robots and technology, to show us the evolution and the success you could achieve by becoming more focused on technology in the mundane day-to-day operations?","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Yes. I mean, it's certainly something that we think about, because these operations are large complex far-flung. The two that come to my mind that we focus on a lot is, just the percentage of processes that are straight through, that are truly straight through that we go from beginning to end without any kind of human intervention or some kind of manual handoff.","And then the second one, we're -- the second closely watched number for us is the number of robotic applications. And robots in this kind of a transaction processing industry is very different than the reports you might see in a manufacturing environment. What you're really talking about is sub-segments of tasks that then get replaced by the robot and then linking those together.","And so, that\u2019s an area where we've done a lot of work on it. We've done the preparation and now we've got to actually install the robots. We've got hundreds of robots installed, but you should expect to see thousands, if not, tens of thousands of those installed from us in the fullness of time. And we should think about -- I don't know that we've talked about or even thought about what we would disclose externally, which -- it's a good question for us to think about.","Eric Walter","And, Gerard, if I might just add that on the metrics, there's a suite of metrics that we need, if you think about the straight through processing on equity trades, basically near a 100. Derivative is much more complex. And so part of what -- as this industry has had explosive growth in volumes, right?","We need to always be at the forefront of what are the right metrics, what are the right suite of metrics. And those shift, because that's a way we can manage better and I don't think we've always done that as an industry. And let's us better communicate to all of you. So we'll think about the right suite of metrics.","And then I'd say that the other metric that really matters at the end of the day is, can we get our cost down year after year, because there's no amount of metric that substitute for total cost. And that is -- you've seen us do that this year. I don't think we've done that consistently in previous years, but it's where the rubber meets the road.","Gerard Cassidy","Certainly does on the expenses and cost as you said. But you will certainly differentiate yourselves from you others if you could come up with a suite of metrics as you point out just to show progress over the last two or three years and then as we go forward just to show that the investing you're doing is paying real dividends\u2026","Eric Aboaf","Yeah.","Gerard Cassidy","\u2026but thank you very much.","Eric Aboaf","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Your line is now open.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Great. Thanks. Quick question on the management fees. I mean, I know there is movement and flows going in an out of the business, but how are you thinking about the fee-rate pressure in their going forward and that there is lot of zero-fee ETFs and all that. Are you expecting it to accelerate from here or decelerate?","Ron O\u2019Hanley","It's certainly an area that we're concerned about Brian. At some level zero is the limit. And we don't see a widespread application of a zero fee, I mean, there's been a lot of attention paid to these zero-fee mutual funds and I think it's mostly been mutual funds not ETF at this point. So when you look at how those mutual funds are being employed, the distribution is being controlled by the sponsor. They're typically a part of a larger offering.","So we don't see a widespread nor would be interested in participating in a widespread adoption of zero-fee vehicles. My intuitive sense is that there's been a lot of pressure here and a lot of movement. And that what we're probably as an industry far more likely to see is continued pressure on the higher end of the market and higher end of products.","If you think about what the pressure has been, it's somewhat ironic that the pressure has been on the lowest-fee products. And you've seen relatively little pressure at the other end of the market on alternatives and things like that. I think you'll start to see more attention paid there.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Clear. And then Eric, you did mention that you wanted to lower expense given in light of the revenue environment that you're facing. Does that mean you're looking for revenues to continue to be under pressure out in 2020 versus 2019? And you need to bring down the expenses just to have the positive operating leverage? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah, it's Eric. It's you too early to begin to think about 2020. We're only halfway through this year. I think we've got some indications of where some of our servicing fee revenues are going to be in third quarter, and we need to navigate through the rest of the year.","I think the broader statement that I made that I'll stand behind, I think and Ron and I and the management team is that this is an industry that where productivity really matters. It's not an industry where you got high single-digit revenue growth rates and if you -- if given that we always need to have expense programs, we need to have an expense program every year. That expense program needs to -- that may have some partial offsets of reinvestments, but those need to be calibrated, but this is one where the expense side of the question for the industry is twice as important as ever.","So we'll continue to do that. And if we get -- as we get lifts in revenue, we want to get back to a place of margin expansion in ROE. And the best way to do that is to grow revenues and to drive expenses down at the same time.","Operator","And there are no questions in queue at this time. I will turn the call back over to Ron O\u2019Hanley for closing comments.","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Well, I just wanted to thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to having further conversations with you. Thanks very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. "],"20325":["State Street Corp.

Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are Chairman CEO, Jay Hooley, who\u2019ll speak first, then Mike Bell, our CFO will take you through our second quarter 2015 earnings slide presentation which is available for download in the investor relation section of our Web site at www.statestreet.com.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.","Now, let me turn it over to Jay.","Jay Hooley","Thanks Anthony and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter 2015 results reflect the strength of our core business as evidenced by 4% growth in service fees compared to the first quarter of 2015 and the benefit of the seasonal increase in securities finance activity. Net interest revenue in the second of 2015 continued to experience pressure as resulted the ongoing low interest rate environment. Overall we remain on track for the growth rate of operating basis fee revenue to exceed the growth rate of operating basis expenses by at least 200 basis points in 2015.","We remained focused on returning capital to our shareholders. During the second quarter of 2015 we purchased approximately 350 million of our common stock and have approximately $1.45 billion remaining on our March 15th, common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of $1.8 billion of our common stock through June 30, 2016. We also increased our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2015.","Now I would like to provide a brief overview of economic and market developments and how our business is affected. Europe has been a major source of marketing stability in the recent past. First modest signs of recovery against the backdrop of zero or even negative yield contributed to the sharpest rise in European bond yield since the resolution of the European debt crisis back in 2010. European equity markets responded by giving back half of the year-to-date gains from the peak of May 21st with some recoveries more recently.","The European debt crisis is still of course very much with us in the form of Greece and has monopolized the headlines from much of the past few weeks. The uncertainty as to whether a deal with Greece could first be reached and now implemented has helped to push investors to move assets away from emerging markets and also contributed to increased foreign exchange volatility and volumes compared to the second quarter of 2014.","However volatility in FX market was lower than first quarter 2015. Not all the risk in global markets has been driven by Europe, Chinese equities fell by more than 30% from the peak giving back more than half of the gains for the year and it's concerned about the growth in China. Although recently government [intervention] has provided some support to equity markets there. Combined these significant disruptions drove market down in June and into July and have reduced risk appetite. Despite these international risks our view of divergence in 2015 still holds as we see easing of monetary policy outside the U.S. but we still expect to see tightening in the U.S.","This led to a much stronger U.S. dollar so far in 2015. Much of the initial change occurred in a first quarter 2015 in anticipation of U.S. tightening and the US dollar has generally moved sideways since then as the markets are waiting to see when tightening might actually start in the U.S. Together these events and trends impact our business in several meaningful ways. First and most significantly, the low interest rate environment continues to negatively impact our net interest revenue and net interest margin as a higher yielding portfolio investments mature or experience pre-payments and then those funds are reinvested in lower yielding investments.","Second, amidst the various Central Bank actions and changes to various market structures, we continue to experience high levels of deposits. As you know, we imposed charges for holding Euro deposits in the fourth quarter 2014 with a number of increases in the charges so far this year. We are continuing to have discussions with our clients regarding excess deposits given the negative effect of these deposits on our capital.","Third, the stronger U.S. dollar has slowed the growth of our servicing fee revenue relative to 2014. However it's important to note that excluding the impact of the stronger US dollar our core business performed well benefiting from growth in our client relationships. Furthermore towards the end of second quarter 2015 we start a number of significant market disruptions which reduced risk appetite.","Now I'd like to discuss asset servicing and asset management businesses. Demonstrating a continuing priority to provide solutions to our clients we added a 143 billion of new servicing commitments during the second quarter. Importantly these wins were broadly diversified across sectors and geographies. U.S. to be serviced that remained to be installed in Q2 period totaled $174 billion at June 30 and we continue to see deep and diverse pipeline.","Our asset management business experienced net outflows of $65 billion during the second quarter of 2015, driven primarily by net outflows of $36 billion from institutional passive equity, 17 billion from ETF primarily institutionally oriented market index funds and 17 billion from cash products.","The significant drivers of passive equity outflows were included rebalancing and cash need by some of our clients due to lower commodity prices. Despite the net asset outflows the impact on net new business revenues were relatively minimal because much of the redemptions were priced lower than the net contributions we received in the quarter. Our asset management business continues to be innovative and has launched 45 new products in the first six months of 2015.","OneLine is off to a fast start is despite a double line total return taxable ETF which is an active fixed income ETF launched in partnership with DoubleLine, it's attracted 800 million in net flows post launch which ranks as the second most successful ETF launched in the U.S. this year.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mike who'll review our financial performance for the second quarter and after that Mike and I will be open to take your call.","Mike Bell","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I\u2019ll comment on a non-operating charge included in our 2Q '15 GAAP basis results. We recorded an after-tax charge of $156 million, or $0.37 a share in 2Q '15 to increase our legal accrual associated with indirect foreign exchange matters. Although we believe these recorded legal accruals will address the financial demands associated with the previously disclosed claims and active investigations regarding our indirect foreign exchange business asserted in the United States by governmental entities and civil litigants.","Significant non financial terms remain outstanding and settlement agreements have not been finalized. Consequently there can be no assurance that we will enter into these settlements that the cost of the new settlements or other resolutions of any such matters will not materially exceed our accruals or that other potentially material claims related to our indirect foreign exchange business will not be asserted against us. As I'm sure you can appreciate settlement discussions are confidential and we're not able to make more specific comments on these matters at this time.","Now refer to Slide 7 for discussion of our 2Q '15 operating business results and from the six months ended June 30, 2015 which I'll refer to as year-to-date. By way of summary 2Q '15 results were driven by strong servicing fees and the seasonal increase in securities finance revenue offset by lower FX trading revenue and continued pressure on NIR. Year-to-date EPS increased approximately 7% compared to the year ago period. Total revenue increased 3.3% from the year ago period reflecting strength in core servicing and management fees. Trading services revenue and securities finance, partially offset by lower NIR and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.","Compared to the year ago period year-to-date fee revenues were negatively impacted by approximately a $149 million from the stronger U.S. dollar, largely offset by a similar benefit in total expenses. Our operating basis effective tax rate for 2Q '15 was 29.6% which is lower than our current expectation for the full year. The first half of 2015 operating basis effective tax rate of 29.1% is also lower than our current full year 2015 expectations primarily due to some one-time items in the first half of 2015 and the timing of our tax advantage investments.","We continue to expect the operating basis tax rate to average within a range of 30% to 32% over the course of the full year. On the capital front in 2Q 2015 we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock. In addition we issued $750 million of preferred stock during 2Q 2015 with the first semiannual dividend to be paid in the third quarter of 2015.","On Slide 8, year-to-date fee revenue increased 5.1% while expenses increased 2.4% versus a year-ago. Importantly on a constant currency basis year-to-date fee revenue increased 8.8%. We continue to make progress against our targets for operating basis total fee revenue growth to outpace operating basis expense growth by at least 200 basis points for the full year 2015 relative to 2014.","Turning now to Slide 10, I'll discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for 2Q '15. First I would note that the stronger U.S. dollar adversely impacted total fee revenue by approximately $71 million as compared to 2Q '14 with a similar benefit to total expenses. Net interest revenue was adversely impacted by the strong U.S. dollar by approximately $17 million compared to 2Q '14. Foreign currency translation did not materially affect sequential quarterly results.","Servicing fees were up from 2Q '14 primarily due to net new business and stronger U.S. equity markets partially offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. On a constant currency basis servicing fees were up approximately 7% compared to the year-ago period. Management fees increased modestly relative to the year-ago primarily due to higher U.S. equity markets and net new business partially offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. On a constant currency basis management fees increased approximately 6% compared to the year-ago period.","Total trading services revenue increased from 2Q 2014 due to higher FX trading revenue reflecting higher volatility in volumes. Compared to 1Q '15 FX trading revenue decreased due to lower volatility. Securities finance revenue increased from 2Q '14 primarily due to new business in enhanced custody and was higher than 1Q '15 reflecting the seasonal increase of revenues in this business which tends to peak in the second quarter. Processing fees and other revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue associated with tax evasion investments.","Moving now to Slide 11. You can see our operating basis net interest revenue and net interest margin continue to be challenged in the prolonged low interest rate environment. Operating basis in IR decreased from 2Q '14 primarily due to lower market interest rates partially offset by higher client deposits. ","Now let's turn to Slide 12 to review 2Q '15 operating basis expenses. Total operating basis expenses increased 3.5% compared to 2Q 2014. As a reminder 1Q '15 expenses included an incremental $137 million associated with the seasonal deferred incentive compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. Compared to the 2Q 2014 result compensation and benefits expenses increased modestly reflecting increased cost to support to business and regulatory initiatives mostly offset by the benefit of the stronger U.S. dollar.","Transaction processing service expenses increased primarily due to higher volumes. Occupancy expenses decreased from 1Q '15 reflecting certain one-time positive items in 2Q '15 for 3Q '15 we expect occupancy expenses to increase as the beneficial items of 2Q '15 are unlikely to repeat. Other operating expenses increased sequentially and from the year-ago quarter primarily due to additional regulatory and compliance costs.","Turning now to Slide 13. I will provide a brief overview of our June 30, 2015 balance sheet. During 2Q '15 we took several actions to move towards our balance sheet optimization and regulatory compliance objectives. The impact included a small increase in the duration of our investment portfolio assets.","Now turn to Slide 14 to review our capital position. As you can see we remained well capitalized which has enabled us to accomplishing top priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. At June 30th, our common equity Tier 1 ratios under the Basal III fully phased in standardized approach increased from March 31st principally due to lower credit risk. Under the fully phased and advanced approach our common equity Tier 1 ratios remained relatively unchanged from March 31st. ","The fully phased in holding company supplementary leverage ratio increased from 1Q '15 primarily due to the issuance of $750 million of preferred stock in 2Q '15. On Monday Federal Reserve issued the final [GSIP] rule which contains the methodology used to determine the capital surcharge for the eight systematically important U.S. Banks. The Federal Reserve's estimate for State Street indicates a surcharge of 1.5% and this is consistent with our discussion of the potential impact of the proposed rule during our investor day this past February.","The primary driver of the higher surcharge under the final rule is a level of non-operational deposits from clients which rule classifies short-term wholesale funds. Now that the rule is final we'll incorporate the surcharge into our balance sheet and capital optimization efforts. Since excess deposits on the primary driver on the higher surcharge this final rule increases the importance of our objective to materially reduce these excess deposits.","Now I'll guess the question likely we are on investors and analyst minds and that is how is our program tracking to reduce the level of excess deposits or our balance sheet. We continue to have discussions with our largest clients regarding the implications for our balance sheet associated with excess deposits and to work together to identify solutions. Although these discussions were constructive our average excess deposits in 2Q '15 did increase as the external factors driving these balances did not abate.","We continue to take actions appropriate for each market for example in Europe we've increased the rate we are charging for Euro deposits. So overall we're targeting a net reduction in excess deposits over the remainder of the year from the 2Q '15 levels.","Turning now to Slide 15, we continue to maintain our outlook for the full year 2015. Despite the weaker Euro exchange rate we continue to expect 2015 total operating basis fee revenue to increase 4% to 7% compared to full year 2014. We also continue to target our operating basis total fee revenue growth to outpace our operating basis expense growth by at least 200 basis points for the full year 2015 relative to 2104. Regarding NIR we expect full year 2015 operating basis NIR to be between $2.16 billion and $2.22 billion. The range assumes that the Fed increases rates in December of 2015. The administered rates do not change in Europe and client deposits will decline over the remainder of the year from their 2Q '15 levels.","We expect to the year at the lower-end of the range as there are no rate increases in the U.S. Lastly we continue to expect our operating basis effective tax rate to be approximately 30% to 32% for the full year of 2015. Since our 2015 year-to-date tax rate was 29.1%, we expect the operating basis effective tax rate for the back half of 2015 to be in the range of 32% to 34%. ","So in summary our 2Q '15 results were driven by positive momentum in servicing fees and securities finance seasonality offset by softer FX trading revenue and continued pressure on net interest revenue. We continue to focus on our key priorities in delivering value-added solutions to our clients, investing in growth initiatives, diligently managing expenses and returning capital to shareholders. And with that I'll turn the call back to Jay.","Jay Hooley","Thanks Mike and I have nothing further to say, Holly so we can open the call up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. I'll now introduce to our first caller. Your first caller's name is Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao","How you thinking about the duration of your portfolio and capacity to extend and like a 50% of your portfolio now being fixed which is the highest it has been in the while and only 1 billion of purchases in 2Q which is a lowest as it's been in a while.","Mike Bell","So, good morning Ashley it's Mike. First of all there is been no change in our overall philosophy Ashley and that is that as it relates to the investment portfolio we continue to invest through the cycle. We continue to have the same type of ALM kinds of risk management practices that we've had in the past. Related to your specific question around the durations, yes it is the case that the -- we can sell in particular some floating rate ABS securities into queue and as a result what's left in the portfolio doesn't have longer average duration but again importantly the overall duration of the assets out of our balance sheet did not change materially quarter-over-quarter. As those -- we did have a higher amount left in cash at the end of the quarter. So again I would expect that there would be no material change over the remainder of the year in terms of our philosophy but we will continue to make these tactical changes to work towards balance sheet optimization particularly under the new regulatory requirements.","Ashley Serrao","So does this also mean that the -- that the time line that you provided at analyst day for NIM to reset to higher levels remains unchanged.","Mike Bell","That is correct Ashley. At this time no change to those longer-term expectations. So obviously there is a lot going on in the environment in terms of how long will it take to get there between market interest rates and the regulatory environment but no change at this point in terms of our long-term expectations.","Ashley Serrao","Final question here. Can you just give us an update on your efforts to bolster your European ETF business? And also to drive a focus on return on capital from a compensation standpoint?","Jay Hooley","Let me start that one Ashley, the ETF business is present in North America, Europe and Asia although as you I think pointed out we\u2019re much more heavy in the U.S. than in Europe and we've been focusing on the European ETF business. It's been really in two dimensions, one is adding distribution wholesalers that largely sell into the private bank and banking networks on the continent in Europe that\u2019s going well. We've made several hires over the course of the last six months. So from a standpoint of feet on the ground distribution we continue to ramp up. Actually the second place that our efforts are going is in the product development side which is a kind of a two key elements of successfully to add franchise. And as I noted in my comments 45 new products introduced so far this year, some portion of those are in Europe. So I would say the effort is underway, we think it's a robust opportunity for us, one of the key opportunities for SSGA.","Your second question Ashley was our efforts to improve our return on equity?","Ashley Serrao","First from a compensation standpoint, when you look at new business?","Jay Hooley","Look at new business, I'm still not sure I got the source of the question. Let me try. Maybe you are referring to is that recently as return on capital has been a more prominent part of how you look at us and how we look at our business. We've turned to looking at return on capital from a customer standpoint and we will have by the end of the year, I think our top 200 customers all calculated out with regards to what the return on capital is, and those statistics end up with client relationship people and their challenge is to improve that return on capital. And I think the closer we get that to our top customers the better shot we have at rebalancing mix whether it's product mix or client profitability in order to drive improved return on capital for initially that 200 customers. And we think between what we\u2019re doing at the top of the house principally on the balance sheet and in excess deposits and then what we\u2019re doing with those 200 customers that\u2019s the right blend of strategies in order to make sure that we consistently improve our return on equity over time.","Mike Bell","Ashley it's Mike I would just add two other points. One is we have incorporated that same discipline in terms of looking at returns at the client level on prospected new business as well. So it is both a new business initiative as well as the existing customers that the Jay described. And the second point I would do is just to reinforce something that Jay said and that is in the near-term the most important thing we can do to improve the company's ROE is to reduce the non-operational deposits and or get those price that they are going to stay on the balance sheet get those price to pay for the required capital that\u2019s associated in, and I can assure that the entire management team is aligned around that effort.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Curious, on Slide 24 you gave us the ex-currency impact on both revenue season and expenses. I guess my question is with the operating expenses up 7.4% year-on-year ex-currency, a lot of that\u2019s driven by the other line and that\u2019s legal and regulatory. Are you able to pars that out on what\u2019s legal and what\u2019s regulatory because obviously going forward we\u2019re going to just be able to strip out what\u2019s the bottom-line there is a lot of moving parts here. Fees we get are still growing, currencies impacting but it seems like expenses is just still keeping pace with the revenues.","Mike Bell","Sure Glenn its Mike. It is the case that the major driver on the year-over-year increase in other operating expenses is the regulatory compliance expenses. And in particular the outside consulting expenses we had communicated to you at Q1 that we thought those were seasonally low and they have certainly rebounded here at Q2. Basically the work that we have underway right now is number one, over time to reduce those outside consulting expenses by completing the projects, completing and getting up to fully acceptable regulatory expectations but also second over time replacing those outside consultants with full time staff.","And so I do expect that we will see a reduction in the second half of the year in terms of the other operating expenses related to both of those, I would rather at this not put a precise number on it because it depends upon a number of factors not the least of which is our success rate in terms of hiring full time staff to replace these people. But it is the case of the big driver is the regulatory compliance expenses. Now I would point out just to be completely balanced that we're still on track to meet our full year expectation and that is to have fee revenue growth outpace our overall expense growth by at least 200 basis points. And we view that as a positive accomplishment in this environment. As I've described to you before that's a better result than we had in that metric in 2014 so again in light of the regulatory situation we view that as a positive step forward.","Glenn Schorr","Just one other follow up. On the securities finance revenue is up I guess 5%, a lot of it is new business and the environment. I'm just curious, what's enhanced custody and if you're seeing any pressures on either rates, spreads or fee splits?","Mike Bell","Sure Glenn, in terms of enhanced custody, enhanced custody was a little less than a third of the securities finance revenue in Q2 so specifically was $48 million of revenue out of a 155 in Q2. In terms of the spreads and fee splits I would say no material change in that environment. I would note that the seasonal trade was in fact less valuable than it's been in prior years. So there wasn't as much benefit from seasonality given the European economic situation. So that in fact was a modest headwind in Q2 versus what it's been in prior years.","Glenn Schorr","Just a tiny follow up on the expense commentary we just had. Does that mean the second half on the other line stays at this level given that you know you're still building out the BSAML systems and things like that, should we look for that to on the year-on-year basis still grow but on an absolute dollar basis be level?","Mike Bell","Glenn, relative to Q2, I would expect the other operating expenses to be lower in Q3 and Q4 subject to the caveat that that does, it does assume that number one we are effective in executing the initiatives that we have on the table right now. And number two, that we are successful in hiring additional full time staff to replace those outside consulting expenses. And again neither of those are trivial but my expectation at this point is that 338 will not be the run rate going forward to the second half of the year that it would be something lower.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Mike if I could ask you a question about balance sheet leverage on deposits. First of all can you try to help us understand how much you're going to try to move off the balance sheet on those excess deposits? What kind of effect do you think you can have on the leverage ratio and whether the impact of those deposit outflows is reflected in your outlook for NIR?","Mike Bell","Sure Ken, good morning. First on the on your specific question on how much do we expect to get off the balance sheet. At this point Ken I'd really prefer not to put a precise number on it, we are in the midst of client communications as we speak and it is a sensitive issue. So we're really looking for a win-win with our clients. I mean just to give a couple of examples, several of our 40 Act fund clients for example are feeling more pressured to hold more liquidity as a result of their own regulatory pressure.","So again it's not just a question of basically demanding that that liquidity comes off. So instead we're really looking for the win-win there. Another example would be in Europe where certainly with all the turmoil going on economically there we have been viewed as a safe haven by several of our important clients now we're obviously charging more for European deposits than we were earlier this year and we recognize that given the economics of having to issue additional prefs to ultimately pay for these deposits that ultimately we need to earn something in the 60 to 70 basis point range of interest margin to pay for the prefs. It is important either to charge enough to make the economics work or to get the deposits off the balance sheet. And the latter we think could occur either through us charging more or through finding a different win-win with our clients or in fact we think it will naturally happen as interest rates rise. So again I at this point really not commit to a number but I'd rather tell you that we are expecting a reduction in deposit levels in the second half of the year.","As it relates to your question around NIR what I would remind you is that on average right now for excess deposits we estimate that we're earning a spread in the high teens. So based on that you could conclude that a $10 billion drop in our average excess deposits would reduce near term NIR by $4 million to $5 million in a quarter. And that is built into the updated NIR range that I gave you in the prepared remarks. So I'd rather not give you a specific number but that is the thinking that is in the overall range.","Ken Usdin","And then just as a quick follow-up. How do we understand the go, no-go decision on timing and magnitude preferred potential?","Mike Bell","Sure, Ken regarding prefs, it really will depend upon a number of things including the overall environment and will include our success rate; both that we're seeing to date but also our expected continued success rate on reducing the level of non-operational deposits. It will include our analysis of our balance sheet for the next CCAR period which is Q4 of this calendar year. So again I'm confident that we could issues prefs if we need to but at this point I would not tell you that we've drawn specific conclusions on a pref insurance plan.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Maybe just on the excess deposits. Can you just give us some number of what they currently are or what the range that you view for excess deposits and then the deposit levels in Europe and UK.","Mike Bell","Regarding our current level of excess deposits if we look at Q2 average in particular we estimate that our Q2 average excess deposits were approximately $62 billion which is an increase relative to Q1 of approximately 8 billion. Now importantly I would add for completeness, please remember here that the LCR rules are now in effect and therefore because of our interpretation of those rules and the regulatory expectations related to those rules. Some of the deposits that we've historically thought of as operational deposits don\u2019t in fact qualify under the LCR to be operational deposits.","So specifically for example, our hedge fund clients and private equity clients just as part of their normal operations is part of us being the custody service provider. We have viewed those historically as operational deposits but there is specifically excluded under the LCR regulations to be included as those. So the round number is 20 billion deposits from those are clients, a portion of those need to be ultimately added to the 62 billion as we calculate LCR over the future. So it's another example of the regulatory environment forcing us to be more conservative than we've done historically.","So again 62 under our traditional method and let me -- look at this as TBD, as the LCR further unfolds. As it relates to your question around European deposits we did see an increase in deposits in Europe, specifically Q2 average European deposits were $40.5 billion. So call that 36 billion to 37 billion of Euro balance and that was up about 4$.5 billion. relative to the Q1 average levels.","Jay Hooley","Brian, just to give you a little -- this is Jay, maybe provide a little bit of nuance color. I was just in Europe a few weeks and I was directly involved in some of these discussions with customers and we're for the major customers who have meaningful excess balance. We're speaking to all of them and I would say a couple of things that to me you're encouraging, I'm convinced we'll make headwind against those. I don\u2019t how much, but when -- but one day we acknowledge the issue, it's a broad based issue. There's even some pressure on the European Banks finally to shed some of these deposits as well. So it's become a more broad based issue.","I think the discussions -- I reading to some creative alternatives for suites and another approaches to move these deposits off and Mike mentioned that average quarter-to-quarter we've actually seen some progress in some of these specific customers. So, it helps so we're out in front of it, I think the discussions are going well. I think we'll find ourselves with lower excess deposits we end the year. It's hard to say how much.","Brian Bedell","And the period ended up much higher but we should probably ignore the -- sincerity and the period numbers that we are assuming. Your idea has really has the direction of the deposit good [ones] and for an average basis is it correct?","Mike Bell","That is correct -- we typically see spikes at quarter end but I think the average is more relevant because in fact the capital ratios for example our calculated based on the average.","Brian Bedell","And then great just my follow up would be as you were talking before about to look into top 200 customers and trying to assess the return on capital from assessments and then I think you also mentioned you're using this framework for new business and maybe either Jay or Mike you could comment on -- I know banking Europe -- that large middle office deal with Euro that something in the -- you would typically win since you're by far the leader in middle office. How maybe you could frame sort of the view on assessing that for new customers in the go forward dynamic of middle office whether you think you might be more competitive or more disciplined going forward? ","Jay Hooley","So I think broadly Brian when you put the return on capital and on a prospective customer, the places that get accentuated are things like any loans that we might have, securities lending particularly indemnified REPO within the product set from services to foreign exchange to securities lending to fund accounting they all have slightly different return on equity calculation. So by looking at it through a return on capital lens you do get a more holistic view. I would say relative to middle-office it's really a profitability equation. It doesn't draw any capital necessarily it's really-- can you drive sufficient profitability in order to make a middle-office deal make sense in the construct of a piece of a larger relationship.","So I deal with probably more as a traditional accounting and custody relationship as far as its return characteristics but the key component is can you money? As you know we have -- we think it's over 10 trillion in assets that we administer in the middle-office and have been have at this for 15 years maybe. We've learned a lot through the 15 years about what makes us a successful middle-office deal. And for me it's largely about the complexity factor whether it involves lift outs, the degree of customization on the system side. So we continue to have handful of middle-office prospects out there and we look pretty closely at whether or not we can make them a creative rate return over the reasonable period of time.","Brian Bedell","And so you are still favorable on this business I assume.","Jay Hooley","Yes. And I would say just from a broader trend basis Brian you have no doubt heard more than you probably want to hear about us on our regulatory compliance challenge here it's hitting asset managers, it's hitting asset owners and so middle-office will continue to be a very important incremental product that we sell. We just need to make sure that it's done well with good pricing discipline.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research.","Luke Montgomery","Another stab at the securities portfolio, I know you have been realigning the mix of securities for the LCR and then fine tuning the balance sheet overall for the SLR. But in dollar terms what\u2019s driving the shrinkage of the portfolio and should we expect that to continue? Is that part of managing the overall duration of the balance sheet?","Mike Bell","Sure, Luke its Mike. First in terms of what\u2019s driving our optimization work, I would really put it in the three different buckets. The first is that, overall we want to improve our capital ratios and then includes the risk based ratios as well as the leverage ratios. Second, we\u2019re looking to improve our mark-to-market sensitivity as measured at the next CCAR cycle, so that\u2019s a consideration and then third of course is the meeting the heightened liquidity expectation. So specifically if we look at for example the sale of our folding rate ABS that\u2019s a good example where we\u2019re getting a relatively low printed spread that we viewed it as having a relatively high mark-to-market sensitivity during the CCAR cycle and of course it doesn't count as HQ away. So that would be an example of something to shrink.","I would not characterize the changes in the securities portfolio as part of an overall change in the duration of the assets on our balance sheet, as I said in one of the earlier answers the overall duration of the assets of our balance sheet did not change materially sequentially. So in fact what we did was we decreased the folding ABS securities which meant that the remaining duration of the remaining portfolio got longer, but that money for the most part is sitting in cash. I would expect that we would be deploying over the second half of the year round number is approximately 5 billion that at June 30th was sitting in cash. So I would not expect that, again it's based on whole lot of different factors but I would not expect additional shrinkage in the overall investment portfolio in dollar terms over the remainder of the year. But again importantly it is optimization is somewhat of the rubik's cube there is a lot of different consideration.","So it will be work that we\u2019ll continue to for a while.","Luke Montgomery","This is the fourth quarter in a row you provisioned for legal contingencies; I know you can't talk about particulars but just any sense of how far along you are on the need for further provisioning. I don't take this as combative but you excluded from operating basis results, but it's getting to the point of kind of usual or unusual or recurring non-recurring and I think it has an impact in your capital ratio. So any help there will be helpful.","Jay Hooley","Let me take a cut at that Lukas, JV. This is the provision relates to the indirect foreign exchange issue that predates 2010 just to put a box around it. And as you noted over the last couple of quarters we've been taking incremental provisions. We believe that we've reached financial terms with the counterparties that we have this deal with. What we haven't done is complete the terms and conditions of the agreement and specific language. We would expect that not only financially but relative to all the agreements that we can reach a conclusion shortly and that we can put this behind us. So I don't know if that helps but we hope that this is from a financial standpoint the end of that issue.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Two follow ups, one on just what you're going through Jay, I noticed there was an update to the operational risk model and you know that putting the pieces together it seems like that's probably due to the fact that you're close to an end in FX charges, is that an accurate read across?","Mike Bell","Betsy its Mike. It is the case that we did update the operational risk capital model as we typically do once a year, that was updated in Q2 and that was part of the divergence between the improvements on the standardized approach risk based capital ratios and the advanced approach risk based capital ratios. However that is not driven by our own FX settlement discussions, it's driven by a number of other factors including what the industry experience has been historically.","Betsy Graseck","And then is the conclusion when you do conclude the FX legal situation there's no further update to the risk model, the operational risk model.","Mike Bell","Betsy, the operational risk model in particular has a lot of different moving parts so I wouldn't try to speculate on future updates to that level. But I would remind you that at this point our binding constraint tends to be the standardized approach and I would expect that to be the case for a while.","Betsy Graseck","And then just separately follow up on the non-operating deposits. I guess I'm wondering if we could get a little bit of color Jay from the kind of things that clients could do with you to potentially either reduce or bring on, I'm not sure if this is what you're referring to, but bring on new business that would enable you to potentially change some of the definitions from non operating to operating. For example if it's a broad set of businesses that their folks are doing with you.","Jay Hooley","Yes, no, it's really less the latter Betsy, it was, let me just give you a few things. One, I think I mentioned this last call and Mike referenced the SEC is very focused around you know liquidity management and 40 Act and the broader based asset management world and we've introduced a pretty sophisticated tool that allows asset managers to stress their liquidity and so the one way we're helping is we're helping them optimize their own liquidity stress testing which sometimes adds to their liquidity sometimes reduces their liquidity needs. But with regard to the conversations it's usually around can we sweep some of the deposits, can we use repo facility. It gets into that level of how do we move deposits out of pure cash which end up on our balance sheet.","And there are handful of approaches and depending on the customer and their view of required liquidity in capital we have different outlets. Probably the most important thing that I would leave you with is these are constructive conversations where you know our customers as we would help them, they're looking to help us so it's not contentious it's just how can we do, how can we move these deposits and do it on a sustainable basis. So at period ends we tend to get spikes in deposits we want to manage those down but we're really looking for some more durable sustainable solutions which will allow us to manage these things and control them over time.","The last point I would make is that you know pricing has always, usually a pretty good way to create behavior and in Europe around the Euro we've introduced pricing, I think we've moved it up three times, it feels like we're reaching that point of equilibrium where it has a cost associated with using our balance sheet and therefore our customers are more sensitive to the cost so we're thinking about not only cost on a ongoing basis but also think about kind of surge pricing that you know if deposits were to go past a certain point the cost of using our balance sheet would go up by a lot and so those discussions and those mechanisms are starting to give us, one we're having better conversations and I think that we are you know likely to improve our situation with regard to excess deposits.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo","Hi. Can you just reconcile two thoughts on the one end you are the port in the storm, your source are strength in Europe, your earnings assets were up 3% every three months, and on the other end, NIR declined and you expect that to perhaps go lower. Is that all due to the excess deposit issue or is there something else going on to?","Mike Bell","So Mike its Mike. Related to Europe, yeah it is the case that we are viewed as a safe haven in Europe and that certainly is a significant contributor to the increase in the deposit base that we saw in Q2 relative to Q1. I mean another issue though is just that the lack of good alternatives for our European clients which relates to your second point and that is that the interest rate environment they are generally along with the credit environment is not particularly attractive. So there is downward pressure on our own NIR related to the assets that back the European deposits. One another point I would note, Jay was talking earlier about a specific client discussions in Europe, I would note that where we've had additional success with some clients in Europe relates to encouraging them through discussions but also with the implied lever of pricing to move out of cash deposits on our balance sheet into for example short-term government bonds and I would expect that over time we'll see more of that movement in Europe for all the reasons that I just mentioned.","Mike Mayo","I mean your peers also had earnings asset growth but NIR was higher whereas Euro was down. Is it relates just the degree that you are in Europe that's the difference? Or anything else?","Mike Bell","Yes, again Mike I don\u2019t like to really speculate on our competitive results. My interpretation of the comparison that you are drawing here is more from the starting point as oppose to some fundamental difference in mix. And therefore our outlook has really remained relatively unchanged throughout this year in terms of NIR. And I -- it's for all the reasons that we've talked about. We expect that excess deposits to come off in addition until we do get a meaningful improvement in market interest rates. We're going to continue to be negatively impacted by this grind of the turnover in our portfolio. Those dynamics have not changed.","Mike Mayo","And that you lowered your NIR upper end of your range just a little bit. Is that right?","Mike Bell","That\u2019s correct, that's mainly driven by our view now that it is unlikely that the Bank of England will raise rates in August. If you recall that was one of the assumptions that we had applied in the rising interest rate scenario at the Investor Day. We think that is unlikely to happen at least in August and that\u2019s really the primary reason for the drop in the very upper end of the positive -- environment range.","Mike Mayo","And last one, NIR, so you have 62 billion of excess deposits you plan on reducing that. That reduction is in the updated NIR guidance. You're just not telling us how much excess deposit reduction you expect to have for competitive end client?","Mike Mayo","That is correct Mike and again we have a range built in there as you can imagine because we don\u2019t have a crystal ball and exactly how much they're going to decline but we do have a decline build in there.","Operator","Your next will come from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Question for you on expenses. So, maybe just there is a couple of moving pieces obviously, but help us understand how we should I guess think about dollar terms for the back half of the year given the fact that second quarter expense growth was a little bit 20 basis points year-over-year versus the revenue growth which is obviously below kind of your 200 basis points. I get the fact on a year-to-date basis you guys are still looking pretty good. But just kind of curious to see where is their flexibility in the model on the expense front into the back half of the year to help you achieve that 200 basis points plus?","Mike Mayo","Sure, I mean the short answer is that it really does depend upon a handful of important factors. One is of course the overall level of net new business that we add in the second half of the year that will directly tie the level of expense that we need to add to service that additional revenues that would be one. Second as I mentioned earlier we do have work underway on the existing regulatory initiatives to work to replace outside consulting expenses with full time staff to the extent of possible and so our success rate there will be a key factor.","And then lastly, importantly we are looking at some additional expense actions literally as we speak and I would expect to be in a position to provide a more public update at our Q3 earnings call but we are looking at some additional expense actions to see what else can be done improve the overall productivity level beyond the regulatory piece that I mentioned.","Alex Blostein","And I guess the comments you guys are making around replacing consultants for full-time staff. When you go through the analysis on and are much spending on consultant versus how much it would cost you bringing in full-time headcount. What\u2019s the net benefit to pretax earnings from doing so?","Mike Mayo","I'd really prefer not to try to give you a specific number at this point. Again it's fair to say that we do have some of that benefit built into our overall second half of the year expectations but I'd rather prefer -- rather not disaggregate specific number from our overall thinking.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Just a quick follow-up I's sorry to be the dead horse on the balance sheet, but ABS was down 7 billion period end that\u2019s a pretty significant increase versus the sort of 2 billion a quarter that you have been doing in the prior year so is that are we getting closer to the end of the rebalancing for the LCR or is there still lot more to do in the ABS side. I am just trying to get a sense of as the NIM compression going to start to be slow a little bit if that is done?","Mike Bell","Jim its Mike. First, at this point I expect that it is unlikely that we would have another material transaction that would shrink the ABS portfolio along the lines of what we did in Q2. I think that\u2019s unlikely to happen in the second half of the year. But as I mentioned this optimization work is going to go on for a while. So I wouldn't at this point foreclose the additional actions for example in 2016 along those lines. Again remember that you've got these longer-term objectives it's not just the 2015 objective, we've got these longer-term objectives of strengthening our overall capital ratios and reducing the mark-to-market sensitivities that impact CCAR from as part of just our overall ROE improvement both of those objectives are important and really are somewhat separate from the near-term needs for LCR compliance.","Jim Mitchell","But can you give us any help on timing and amount of additional mix shift?","Mike Bell","Again Jim I think that the mix shift will continue for several quarters, and again importantly that is factored into the NIR range that we gave in our prepared remarks.","Jim Mitchell","And then maybe just a quick follow-up with the guidelines from the Fed and they said SLR will not be part of the next CCAR. Does that some of the pressure off in terms of give you more time to think about how entire potentially higher interest rates effects deposits and takes the pressure off on the comfort side, can you give it another year to see how things progress or do you still have to kind of build in a glide path.","Mike Bell","Jim you are absolutely right that was helpful to us probably to helpful to others as well that the NPR that was released around the 2016 CCAR indicated that SLR would not be part of the process for this year that is in fact helpful. I would point out though that tier 1 leverage was to constraint at this past CCAR and that remains an important consideration for the next CCA, so it's certainly means to that it's still very important that we pay attention to the non-operational deposits as it relates to the capital for next year and any potential pref issuance in particular.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Adam Beatty with Bank of America.","Adam Beatty","Question on the pipeline and backlog in asset servicing, it looks like the backlog were to be installed came down somewhat in the quarter. Does that create kind of a natural bias for higher servicing revenue subject of course to markets and currencies and also looks like the win rate ticked down a little bit do you expect that to normalize?","Jay Hooley","Sure, let me take that one, this is Jay. On the pipeline more broadly nothing really has changed its robust, its diverse, there is activity I just gone through over the last six weeks I've been on all continents and visited 15 different offices and there is a lot of activity that I think is stimulated by constrained environment compliance and regulatory. So pipelines are solid. For the quarter we committed I think it was 143 billion and massive, that was a little low relative to what we've been running probably last couple of years we've been in the 200 billion to 300 billion range. I wouldn't read into it, I think just some other stuff this timing.","So no read through there. With regard to I think at the beginning of your question, we've got 174 billion I think that sounds right of assets that has committed that have not yet installed and I'm looking around the table, I think that\u2019s about where we've been historically. So the relationship between pipeline, kind of a funnel what we win and how we implement seems pretty steady. I would say in the 174 and in the 143 there aren\u2019t big lumpy two year implantations, which will delay revenue, so we should expect a pretty steady stream of service fee revenue that would trickle out of those kind of few factors.","Mike Bell","Adam its Mike, the only other thing I would add is you noted our GS revenue was strong in the quarter relative to both Q1 as well as a year ago and certainly we've gotten good contribution, we got contribution in Q2 from the net new business piece of it.","Adam Beatty","Also, on the asset management in terms of some of the redemptions in past, we've heard a couple of times this quarter about international and sovereign clients maybe having some liquidity needs based on lower commodity prices. What's your outlook on that given where things are right now and given what you're hearing from your clients? Is there a potential for an additional draw down there or is that pretty much over in?","Jay Hooley","I think that if you look at oil prices as probably maybe the biggest single driver of that, you know the, I don't know what your outlook for you know, crude is but it feels to me like was an adjustment from over a $100 a barrel to $50 a barrel as opposed to months and time kind of adjustment. So I wouldn't expect there would be big additional outflows, I don't know I mean I think it's unlikely oil will go lower and therefore it feels more like a one-time adjustment versus something that we're going to see every quarter.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","So first question on FX, revenues looked light versus peers and just wanted to, I don\u2019t know whether there's a connection here but we saw the FX revenues come in a bit late and then we continue to see these FX charges ratchet and the discussion is ongoing. Is it possible that there's a connection there?","Jay Hooley","No, no connection at all Bren, you know if you look at -- we track as you'd expect pretty closely the indirect FX, the direct FX, the platform FX and all pretty steady as she goes, I think the -- you know it's hard to make any judgment on a quarter, I think if back at Investor Day I don't know if you recall this, but we showed our FX performance in absolute terms versus the near end peers both electronic and directly traded and it's quite a bit higher than on an absolute basis. And I think if you stretch back over a couple two or three quarters and look at trends you would see our FX performance is good as if not better than the peers.","So nothing really in the quarter and certainly no connection between these litigation discussions which are historical and our customers understand that, have had no influence on indirect FX which is where if it had influence it would have influence.","Brennan Hawken","And then maybe a bit more of a broad or strategic question on expenses. You know certainly this is not easy times for large financial services companies and GSIBs but you could argue that higher regulatory expense pressure is not really environmental but now it's just part of the new operating landscape rather than being a transient factor. And I know you referenced that you're looking to do a few things, later in the year, so clearly that's not lost on you but you know, I sense from conversations with investors that there's increasing frustration on a lack of push on the expense front. The revenue kind of is what it is, expenses are bit more in your control, why is it, can you help us understand why there hasn't been more movement on the expense front.","Jay Hooley","Yes, let me start that one and then Mike can maybe jump in. So first off I agree with your point of view that the regulatory compliance is a structural shift and I think most firms are trying to deal with the immediacy and then the ongoing nature of, how no idea comply with these things but how do you comply with these things in a highly automated way which is the kind of way we would look at anything at State Street.","So we've got a combination of addressing that with you know manpower, consultants, individuals but ultimately want to apply technology and drive down the cost of complying not only for ourselves but as a service to our customers. But let me just introduce another front which is maybe what the comment that Mike made few cycles ago. You know we went through the five year IT and Ops transformation plan and I think it was, it set us up nicely. You've heard me talk about the fact that we\u2019ve had great core discipline around core systems, we haven't drifted to multiple systems and we\u2019ve taken those common systems and improved the processes and we've leveraged work sites, China, Poland at all, we continue to do that. There's an ongoing opportunity now that we've moved in that direction to continue to apply technology to replace labor and so you know part of what has underpinned the last year have been the regulatory and compliance cost offset by some of the operational improvements that we're making which is really a fine technology to reduce labor.","There is much more opportunity to do more there, so what we're thinking about is the way to accelerate some of that activity to do more assistance to accelerate the minimization of the labor content and the work output, if I can say that way. And we view that and we have viewed that as something that's ongoing because we don\u2019t believe among that the regulatory compliance pressure lets up and we don\u2019t know when the top line environment gets better.","So the thing we can control is the expenses, so we've in the background been continuing to invest in technology to improve our operational efficiency but the question is can we do more; can we accelerate some of that activity. If that helps?","Operator","And our last question will come from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Starting with some of the regulatory type issues that is being going on with BSA, AML and then with the Wells notice but you received I think relating to still lobbying around the pensions business. Are those having any impact on growth and that new generation you kind of have to focus a bit more internally rather than externally and going out and winning new business?","Jay Hooley","Yes, fair question Geoffrey. I would say no, pretty directly the AML, BSA activity is -- we were criticized for not having the level of process that the regulators expected and wanted us to have so we have -- and we've been at this for 18 months. It's a pretty segregated activity that we're conducting country-by-country, business-by-business and so it's pretty content, it's got project plans, it's managed separately from the business line. So I really don\u2019t think this going hinder our ability to grow the revenue line and on the Wells notice reference which again is kind of pre 2012 reference to acquisition of pension retirement plans using consultants and again we are working through that. We've got a different point of view than others on that but it doesn\u2019t, it hasn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t affect any revenue generation.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then just a quick follow up on something you said earlier. You mentioned the [GSIP] buffers as a fact that it feeds into the walk around non-operational deposits. Is it all that to come down from 150 bps to 100 bps and so how much you need to do get yourself into the lower bucket?","Mike Bell","Geoffrey, its Mike. There are a number of different nuances with the final rule that just came out on Monday. So I think it's a little bit early to give you a specific number but it's not lost of us that the increased excess deposits over the last couple of years is the single biggest factor driving our [GSIP] surcharge up and therefore I just -- it's a really -- it increases what was already a priority. It increases the importance of reducing those.","Now again, some of that will happen from our actions. We think some of that will happen naturally as market interest rates rise but it does increase the importance of that work. I think it's the most important thing I wouldn\u2019t leave you for this way. I think that a 150 basis points [GSIP] surcharge by itself is manageable but again there are -- number one, we would obviously like to have reduce the as the piece that's related to the excess deposits and just more of an incentive to get that accomplish.","Jay Hooley","And just to be clear for everybody on the call that it's our expectation as if we do that and 150 or whatever it is vary. So there will be recalibration of that. So there is a motivation incentive to draw deposits down.","Operator","Thank you and that was our final question.

Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley; and our CFO, Eric Aboaf, will speak first on our second quarter 2018 earnings highlights followed by this morning's announcement of our agreement to acquire Charles River Development. Presentations on each of these are available for download on the Investor Relations website, investors.statestreet.com.

As you've seen, we've announced our second quarter results as well as a definitive agreement to acquire Charles River Development, a premier front office investment management software solutions provider.","Our acquisition of Charles River represents a key milestone in our digital and technology transformation aimed at leading the evolution of the investment servicing industry. We're very pleased with this transaction and we'll take you through the details a little later on the call.","First, let me cover some of the highlights of the second quarter and then I will turn it over Eric to walk you through the 2Q '18 financials. We'll then discuss the announced acquisition in more detail.","Our second quarter and year-to-date 2018 results reflects strength across our asset servicing and asset management businesses as we continue to deepen client relationships, win new business and advance our digital transformation. Second quarter earnings also included substantial EPS growth and increased return on equity.","We continue to see strength across our core franchise. Equity market appreciation and new business lifted our assets under custody administration with growth of approximately 9% from second quarter 2017 to nearly $34 trillion. We saw year-to-date servicing commitments of approximately $1.5 trillion, of which approximately $105 billion were won in the second quarter with new business yet to be installed of approximately $300 billion as we installed the large Vanguard win and begin the BlackRock transition. And we are recognized as a number one FX provider to asset managers in the Real Money FX survey with the best overall customer satisfaction rate.","State Street Global Advisors finished second quarter 2018 with assets under management levels of $2.7 trillion, up approximately 5% from second quarter 2017, driven by strength in equity markets and ETF flows with continued traction in our low-cost ETF products launched late last year.","Furthermore, we continue to realize benefits from Beacon, our multi-year program to digitize our business and drive new solutions and innovations for our clients while creating greater efficiencies for State Street. We achieved a net benefit of approximately $60 million in both the first and second quarters of this year and now expect full year 2018 savings to be approximately $200 million, which exceeds our previously announced guidance of $150 million.","Additionally, our ability to deliver new tools and functionality is proving to be a meaningful factor in point of differentiation and client decisions as demonstrated by the Vanguard win.","Building on the success of Beacon, we are monetizing our digitization accomplishments and reducing manual processes. We are continuing to focus on achieving greater organizational effectiveness and streamlining as we move into the next phase of opportunities, which Eric will discuss further. ","To conclude, I'm very pleased with our financial performance to date. Revenue growth was strong, driven by both fee revenue and net interest income, reflecting the higher U.S. market interest rates, continued market appreciation, new business wins and higher trading activity. We remain focused on expense management, which you saw this quarter as we actively calibrated cost to revenues while prudently investing in new products and solutions.","We also declared a common stock dividend of $0.42 per share in the quarter. And yesterday we declared a 3Q '18 dividend of $0.47 per share, representing an increase of 12% from 2Q '18 dividend. Importantly, we continue to be well positioned to achieve our financial objectives in 2018, including delivering full year positive fee operating leverage.","And with that, over to you, Eric?","Eric Aboaf","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4 where I will begin my review of 2Q '18 and year-to-date results. We have highlighted a few notable items, which we believe provide investors insight into specific initiatives as well as our underlying business trends.","As you can see on the right, 2Q '18 results included net charge of $77 million or $0.17 per share consisting of $61 million of compensation expenses related to the organizational realignment and management delayering and $16 million of occupancy costs as we continue right size our real estate footprint. I'll also remind you that the quarters of 2018 reflect the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. This has increased both total fee and total expense by $70 million year-over-year but as EBIT neutral.","Now let me move to Slide 5 where most of my comments will focus on year-over-year results. 2Q '18 EPS increased to $1.88, up 23% compared to 2Q '17. Excluding the $0.17 related to the repositioning charge, 2Q '18 EPS increased to $2.05. Both 2Q '18 and year-to-date results reflect continued strength across servicing fees, management fees and trading services as well as continued improvement in net interest income supported by the higher interest rate environment.","We continue to prudently manage expenses related to the revenue environment as demonstrated by an increase of 1 percentage point in 2Q '18 pretax margin. We achieved positive operating leverage of 1.4 percentage points compared to 2Q '17. Fee operating leverage was negative largely due to lower 2Q '18 securities and seasonality relative to 2Q '17, which were up 1.1 percentage points. Return on equity reached 14.7%, up 2.1 percentage points relative to 2Q '17.","Now let me turn to Slide 6 to review AUCA and AUM performance. 2Q '18 AUCA of $33.9 trillion increased 9% from 2Q '17. Growth was primarily driven by a combination of market appreciation, strong new business and client activity especially in EMEA and our middle office outsourcing business. AUCA increased 2% sequentially driven by the insulation of a significant portion of the bank Vanguard in the first quarter offset by the previously announced BlackRock transition, which is about 50% complete and lower market levels.","In our Asset Management business, AUM increased 4% from 2Q '17, driven by market appreciation and higher yielding ETF inflows partially offset by outflows from lower fee institutional index assets in a subdued market environment.","Please turn to Slide 7, where I will review 2Q '18 revenue. Total fee revenue increased 6% relative to 2Q '17 reflecting solid performance across most of our businesses. Let me take you through some of the details. Servicing fees increased 3%, reflecting higher global equity markets, increased client activity and new business, partially offset by continued modest hedge fund outflows. On a sequential basis, servicing fees decreased due impart the lower global equity markets as well as the transaction of the previously announced BlackRock assets.","Management fees increased 17%, benefiting from higher global equity markets as well as approximately $45 million related to the new revenue recognition standard. Management fees decreased on a sequential basis, reflecting lower global equity markets as well as net outflows in line with muted industry close this quarter. Trading services revenue increased 9%, primarily due to higher FX client volumes, driven by the depth of our FX capabilities and platforms, which continue to differentiate our offerings. Securities finance fees decreased, driven by lower seasonal activity into 2Q '18 relative to 2Q '17.","Moving the Slide 8, NII was up 15% on a GAAP basis and then increased 19 basis points on a fully tax-equivalent basis relative to 2Q '17. NII benefited from higher U.S. interest rates and discipline liability pricing, partially offset by a mix shift to HQLA assets. NIM increased due to higher NII and a smaller interest earnings asset basis we reposition the investment portfolio at the end of first quarter. Deposit betas for the U.S. interest-bearing accounts continue to move a bit higher but stayed in line with our expectation. We continue to expect good growth in NII.","Now let me turn to Slide 9 to review 2Q '18 expenses. Year-on-year expenses increased $21 million due to currency translation and $70 million related to the new accounting for revenue recognition. When considering these two effects, year-over-year expenses were well controlled, increasing just 2% from the year ago quarter as we actually manage the cost base and calibrated to revenues this quarter. Relative to 1Q '18 expenses decreased 4%, which included 1Q seasonally elevated compensation costs and the 2Q management delayering charge.","Excluding these 2 items underlying expenses were well controlled, decreasing 1% sequentially. A top priority continues to be the actively managed expenses relative to revenues. From a line item perspective, let me cover the year-over-year trends quickly. Compensation employee benefits decreased 1% relative to 2Q \u201817 due to continued Beacon savings and lower performance related incentive compensation, partially offset by costs to support new business. Transaction processing increased relative to 2Q '17 reflecting higher client volumes and market levels as well as the impact of the new revenue recognition standard.","Information systems increased relative to 2Q '17 as a result of higher Beacon related investments. Occupancy costs were up compared to 2Q '17, primarily driven by $16 million in the occupancy expense charge related to the continued rightsizing of our footprint, partially offset by a few discrete items that will not reoccur. Other expenses increased primarily due the new accounting for revenue recognition. Our intention is to keep second half expenses roughly in line with first half as of 1Q '18 seasonally deferred compensation bump.","Let me now move to Slide 10 to review our progress on State Street Beacon. On the left side of the slide, you can see that we achieved almost $16 million in net Beacon sales this quarter by optimizing our core servicing business, transforming our IT infrastructure and by gaining efficiencies within the corporate functions and SSGA. Notably, we now expect to realize approximately $200 million savings in 2018, which exceeds our previously announced guidance of $150 million.","Shifting to the right side of the slide, building on the success of Beacon, we are now transitioning to the next phase of efficiency initiatives that come as we begin to implement the organizational changes we announced in November, when we moved from a regional product structure to a single global highly functionalized business. We've thus recorded a $77 million repositioning charge related to management delayering as we implement this organizational change. We expect this repositioning charge to payback in about a year.","Moving to the next slide, let me touch on our balance sheet. Our capital ratios remain healthy and all ratios increased. Also, as you are aware, last month, our 2018 capital plan received a non-objection from the Fed as well as some taxable conditions. The non-objection was based on our CCAR submission including a strategic change that contemplated the acquisition of Charles River as a potential transaction and the related capital ratio.","Moving to the Slide 12, let me briefly summarize results. Both 2Q and year-to-date reflect continued business momentum resulting in year-to-date EPS growth of 30% and an increase in ROE of 2.5 points. Year-to-date total revenue increased 10% supporting over 3 percentage points of positive leverage as well as an increase in pretax margin of over 2 percentage points.","Before turning the call back to Jay, let me briefly touch on our current outlook, which excludes any contribution from today's announced acquisition of Charles River Development. We remain on track to deliver on our 2018 financial objectives, including fee revenue growth of 7% to 8%, fee operating leverage of 75 to 150 basis points, NII growth of 10% to 13% and a tax rate of 15% to 17%. It remains the top priority to actively manage the expense base relative to revenue. And you can expect us to continue to do so.","Now, let me turn the call back to Jay to start the discussion of our acquisition of Charles River, and then I'll be back to take you through the transaction details.","Jay Hooley","Thanks, Eric. And let me ask everyone to please turn to Slide 3 in the second section of today's presentation on our acquisition of Charles River Development. Today's announcement represents an important milestone in the digital and technological transformation aimed at providing clients with differentiated solutions. And importantly, this transaction will allow State Street to address a fragmented and underserved approximately $8 billion front office revenue pool opportunity.","Against the backdrop of significant industry change, institutional investors are relentlessly focusing on delivering better investment returns. At the same time, these investors face increasing complexity and regulatory expectations coupled with the needs to upgrade technology and manage costs while still focusing on product or geographic expansion. To address these challenges, they want solutions that add value across the front, middle and back-office.","We believe that the combination of State Street and Charles River will create an unparalleled platform for our client that uniquely positions us as the first ever global front, middle and back-office solution providers in the industry. Importantly, our platform will be interoperable, meaning that will connect and exchange data with other industry platforms and providers as well as the client's proprietary systems.","Charles River provides leading investment management software solutions to institutional asset managers, insurers, pension funds and wealth managers with a single investment platform for improved decision making, better risk management and greater efficiency while lowering costs. Building on our digital efforts, Charles River capabilities also include a comprehensive suite of advanced data management services.","In addition the strategic benefits I just mentioned and Charles River's leading position in the industry, we believe the transaction is financially compelling. We expect to recognize significant cost and revenue synergies that will drive attractive long-term financial returns for State Street shareholders.","In addition, the transaction generates an internal rate of return of approximately 14% with cost synergies only and greater than 28% with full costs in revenue synergies, excluding our cost of capital -- exceeding our cost of capital.","Moving to Slide 4. Let me spend some time further highlighting Charles River\u2019s business model. As I mentioned, Charles River is a leading provider of investment management software solutions, and importantly, the acquisition provides a leading front office platform and builds on our digitization efforts. Charles River\u2019s capabilities also include a comprehensive suite of advanced data management services. Charles River has more than 300 clients, many of whom are also State Street clients with an aggregate asset under management of over $25 trillion. Revenue was $311 million in 2017 and notably 85% of Charles River's revenue base is recurring, providing a stable revenue stream, which is not dependent on market levels.","On the bottom right of the slide, you can see Charles River\u2019s broad client base and business segments. Charles River's reach by market segment in region is highly aligned with our target markets. We\u2019ll also allowing opportunity to both expand share of wallet as well as the potential to add new clients. Notably, the acquisition will also enable us to meaningfully address the large adjacent revenue pool of the wealth advisor market.","Let me briefly highlight how the acquisition enables us to create an integrated front to back platform by combining State Street's data and analytics and those are Charles River and third party providers.","On Page 5, you can see what we mean by an integrated platform that optimizes the front, middle and back office. I\u2019m often asked about our front, middle and back office capabilities. I think this slide helps bring those categories to life. On the left side of the slide you can see key activities within the front, middle and back office. Charles River's core front office capabilities for the investment management industry include portfolio modeling, construction and analysis, trade management and execution, order generation and pre-trade compliance aimed at an approximately $8 billion front office market. Charles River\u2019s capabilities expanded to the middle office comprised of functions such as risk monitoring, client reporting, and post-trade support areas that complement our existing middle office offerings.","As you\u2019re well aware, State Street\u2019s front, middle and leading back office competencies begin with data and analysis. It include middle office functions such as investment accounting as well as core back office functions of custody fund administration and fund accounting. On the far right of the slide, you can see that the acquisition will create a powerful new combination. Charles River enables State Street to further expand meaningfully into the front office and ultimately deliver an integrated front to back office platform, a compelling proposition to help those client's rationalize front office systems, enhance investment and risk management, extract meaningful insights from data and access additional sources of liquidity.","With that, let me turn it over to Eric to further highlight why the acquisition is a compelling strategic opportunity. Eric?","Eric Aboaf","Thank you, Jay. Let me review the deal terms and go into some detail on the points that Jay just highlighted. As you can see on Slide 6, the purchase price is $2.6 billion. This will be financed by sustaining buybacks from 2Q to 4Q '18, which is worth $950 million and the balance will be financed with roughly two thirds common equity and a third preferred stock. We will look to offset the preferred by a similarly size redemption is more expenses preferred in late 2019. Lastly, we expect the transition to close by 4Q '18.","We are paying an attractive price for our premier front-office franchise. The PE with just cost synergies is 14 times and with full synergies is 10.5 times. The IRR in the transaction, which is a good benchmark on how we think about deploying capital, is about 14% with just cost synergies alone. This exceeds our cost of equity, which makes us confident an attractive use of capital. With full cost in revenue synergies the IRR is over 20%.","The financial metrics of this transaction are attractive because we're bringing together two leading companies with highly complementary product offerings focused on exactly the same top-tier client base. So first, we expect Charles River to help accelerate State Street's annual fee growth by 75 to 125 basis points as we deliver on revenue synergies worth $80 million of EBIT by 2021, which I will detail out in a moment. Notably, Charles River's significant recurring revenue streams adds to and diversifies our current servicing fee revenue. Second, we planned to create efficiencies that will ramp up overtime, which results in cost synergies of $60 million in 2021. EPS accretion is also expected within 2 years.","Moving to Slide 7, our combined client base will provide a natural opportunity to gain share of wallet among State Street and Charles River's existing clients, leveraging our platforms and delivering several additional services. To level set here at State Street we'll ready to serve about 75% or 155 of the top 220 institutional asset managers where we have senior relationships with CEOs, CIOs, COOs and business heads. Only half of the 155 are served by Charles River today as we detailed in the summary note at the bottom of the page.","So let me outline several areas of opportunity. First, we can help Charles River to grow their client base by leveraging our 155 top tier relationships, which could significantly increase their penetration of our top clients. Second, we have the ability to further expand the existing relationships with more than 70 shared top-tier clients, which provide us with a unique opportunity to rollout a true front, middle and back-office platforms. No other custody bank can do this. Third, with this combination, we have the opportunity to operate in State Street platform to mid-sized institutions that represent the additional 45% of global asset management outside the top 220 institutions.","Lastly, another exciting opportunity is to scale Charles River's established presence in the high-growth wealth management in private banking space. Here we can also leverage Charles River's Wealth Management solution to expand State Street's costing and accounting services into this attractive segment.","Turning to Slide 8, let me provide a bit more details on how we will execute on these opportunities and the expected revenue in cost synergies as a result of the enhanced platform. By 2021, we are targeting annual revenue synergies to deliver EBIT of $75 million to $85 million and annual cost synergies of $55 million to $65 million.","On the left side of the slide, you can see the components of the targeted revenue synergies. We have outlined these opportunities across five key categories each of which has a specific execution plan. $70 million to $75 million of the expected revenue synergies are driven by upgrading about 10 Charles River clients from client-sold software to the State Street Cloud and introducing Charles River to 10 to 15 State Street clients. We expect $55 million to $60 million of synergies to expanding our core, middle and back office services into Charles River\u2019s existing base of top-tier and midsized clients. Approximately $70 million of revenue synergies are driven by expanding State Street data and analytic offerings. Gaining significant front office capabilities here supports our current front office data offerings allowing us to accelerate the growth of our global exchange business. This is particularly powerful for our joint clients. $35 million to $40 million will be achieved by integrating State Street\u2019s premier trading platforms FX Connect, Currenex, Fund Connect into the part of our client investment workflows with Charles River\u2019s platform, driving increased transaction volumes and trading fee revenues. And another $30 million to $35 million by penetrating the wealth management segment, which I just described. For each of these revenue opportunities, we conservatively assume product delivery cost base on fully loaded margins.","Moving to the right of the slide, there are three main drivers contributing to the target $55 million to $65 million of cost synergies. First, we expect to drive operational efficiencies by streamlining existing custody, accounting and middle office operations lowering unit costs by $35 million. Second, Charles River enables State Street's retire legacy systems to achieve an additional $10 million to $15 million savings.","And lastly, we expect $10 million to $15 million in expense savings related to the implementation of Charles River\u2019s front office solutions within SSGA. This is a sort of benefit that many clients will see. And we've detailed this opportunity in the appendix. All of the savings can be realized from State Street\u2019s existing cost base.","Turning to Slide 9. Let me wrap up by highlighting the strategic and financial points to support the value that Charles River provides the State Street's businesses and shareholders. Overall, this transaction represents a significant milestone in our technology transformation, which creates a first ever front, middle, back office solutions and generates attractive financial returns.","We are expanding into an $8 billion revenue pool, which is fragmented and underserved today. We expect to accelerate State Street's fee revenue growth as we round out asset management and asset services with a third nature of business. We expect EPS accretion within 2 years of the acquisition supported by various specific revenue and cost synergies. And while times accretion is a bit outside our traditional financial envelope, the intrinsic value and IRR are consulate above the cost of capital with cost synergies alone.","Let me now turn it back over to Jay and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Jay Hooley","Thanks, Eric. And Lisa, we are now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","So question on Charles River deals. With Eze Castle and Bloomberg being other big independent players, I\u2019m curious on why timing is now for vertical integration or I don\u2019t know vertical is the right word, but the integration of front-to-middle-to-back. And then I\u2019m curious on how pricing will work? Will Charles River continue to charge explicitly or will this being woven into the overall State Street relationship pricing?","Jay Hooley","Yes, Glenn, this is Jay. Let me start that. I might ask Ron to comment as well. There is a clear trend, and it\u2019s not a new trend in the world of front, middle, back to create more integration. You mentioned Eze and Bloomberg and BlackRock. We work with BlackRock on a similar solution where we were integrating front, middle and back office. Investment managers are under considerable pressure to get more efficient to gain greater access to data, to do more things for the single touch. So I think this front, middle, back integration is clearly the wave of the future. And up till now, it's been it's all fragmented with the custodians going into the middle office, but not all the way into the front office, you got some front office players working with middle and back-office players. So I think it's very clearly the direction of travel in this industry. And it will come together probably overtime even more so.","I think it's also true that we mentioned the word interoperability, which is we have a series of clients and now with Charles River we have a combined series of clients that we can better link together the three components of middle, front and back office. But we also will continue to work with Bloomberg and we've got a significant partnership with BlackRock and Aladdin, where we're the largest custodian in integrating the lab provider and service. So it's going to happen in different forms.","One last point I would mention is that one of the things that led us to Charles River was the State Street Global Advisors who a couple of years ago was looking to rationalize their front-office, which is something that most firms are in some form of doing. And landed on Charles River and that's what led us to Charles River. And SSGA will be one of the places where we'll integrate and where we'll control the front, middle and back-office to create a streamline interface, which will not only create efficiencies, free of data, but give us access to the front-office for the first time for some of our liquidity products and trading products. Now, would you add anything to that Ron?","Ronald O'Hanley","Sure, Glenn. This is Ron. What I would add to Jay's comments are that, in terms of your question on timing, it's a combination of pull from clients and where we are in our own digital and data journey. On that pull from clients, you need to be very well aware of this. Large asset managers and large asset owners that act like asset managers are operating with very complicated both technology and operations stacks. And there is a strong desire to simplify, a strong desire to get more straightforward processing and a strong desire to make better use of data in a timely way, which leads to the second point in timing.","As you know we've been on this road now for a while with Beacon and there's a lot of things that Beacon is driving. But one of the things that it's driving is our ability to take client data and present it back to the clients in a highly usable form whether to reinjected back into the investment process for analytics et cetera. So it's this data-enabled platform that will work with Charles River, but as importantly as Jay said we'll interoperate with other providers because what that means not all investment managers are going to want the same thing, but the one thing they do want is some kind of platform that enables them to work with their providers of choice and not have to deal with the number of reconciliations.","Jay Hooley","And Glenn, let me just pick up the second question which was about pricing. We will keep Charles River as a standalone entity their uptake. There's a convenience of their local. They're right at the street from us. And it will continue to be Charles River, a State Street company. And in fact, we will combine some of our existing capabilities largely in the GX world into Charles River to make sure that from a pricing standpoint that is for the state and set of capabilities, which will have distinctive pricing separate from our middle and back office capabilities.","Glenn Schorr","One last one, Eric. What cost of capital used in the IRR calculation?","Eric Aboaf","Just typical 10% to be conservative, so we think that\u2019s appropriate for our business and then the other important part of the model of the IRR is always professional growth rate, which we tagged at 4%, which I think is overall on the low end of the range. But we thought, when we do these kinds of deals, we need to do it conservatively.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Question for you just as around the capital side of things here, Eric. I was just wondering if you could walk us through. What happens to capital ratios on a pro forma basis at closing? And just wondering you\u2019re moving off the buyback in the 950 for this year. Why the decision to issue rather than just not buyback going forward in terms of saving that extra capital? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Sure. The capital ratios are actually embedded in our CCAR submission. So you can actually take the controls as a pro forma. Obviously, I think we came in a little better in the second quarter than expected and that\u2019ll flow through. When we, you can imagine this deal has been in process for a series of months and quarters that predated our CCAR submission. So as we were gearing up for the April, the early April submission of CCAR, this was a strong possibility but by no means assure. And so what we felt we should do Ken is to submitted as one of those strategic changes that is the specific form in the Fed filings for that. And effectively do it on auto call a capital ratio neutral basis. And so that\u2019s why you see to spend buyback plus issues some amount of common equity plus top-up with preferred to get the $2.6 billion. On a Tier 1 ratio basis is the neutral -- on a leverage ratio basis it'll be neutral, on a set one ratio basis it'll be down by roughly about 50 basis points literally because of the preferred piece of the stack.","Ken Usdin ","And then just a choice between issuing versus just not buying back into next year CCAR, just -- how do you, what\u2019s the economics of that decision?","Eric Aboaf","It\u2019s not dramatically different. There\u2019s a little bit of question, underwriter fees and discount when you go out to the market. On the other hand, we felt like it\u2019s important to get on with this acquisition and to bring it together by the end of the year. And to be honest, we wanted to -- we\u2019re also signaling that we\u2019re confident in our earnings stream and our go forward earnings stream. And so while we temporarily suspend the buyback this past quarter and then two more quarters, we're fully committed to continue to return capital to shareholders on a go forward basis.","Ken Usdin ","Okay. And I\u2019ll just one more on the capital front middle and I\u2019ll stand aside. Just on coming back to CCAR this year and the counterparty number, which was candid like you guys have to go back and just look through that more. Can you tell us about the backend forth about that? What do you think was in the results? What do you have to do now? What is it mean if anything as you go forward? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah, on the counterparty condition, I think the first observation which is make -- which I think the Fed made in its summary is they clearly felt comfortable enough with our capital planning processes, our management processes, our risk processes, our business processes to give us non-objection. So I think the kind of the strategic clarity is there. And in fact this was also embedded in this mission was an acquisition. And so they felt, I think, you have to ask them obviously, but it's our understanding is they signal with their actions which were quite positive.","They have asked us to do some more work on the counterparty loss paths. We've obviously been doing that since we've seen in January, so that's not new. We've started by adding more measurement and scenarios to our kind of pool of our arsenal of monitoring mechanisms we're sharing that with the Fed. And I think we'll refine the exact deliverables that we have over the next month or two and then execute on those in line with their expectations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hey good morning guys. A couple of more deal related questions. I guess the first one on Charles River, pretty robust operating income growth over the last couple of years. It looks like 11% CAGR. Can you guys talk a little bit about what do you contemplate for their growth to be on a standalone basis in your kind of accretion math through 2020? And then secondly, maybe sentimented on just the nature of the contracts they have with clients kind of like what's the average length? And is there anything of the contracts related to change of control that could lead them to negotiate, so just kind of thinking for any sort of revenue attrition you might have on the back of this.","Eric Aboaf","Yes, Alex, it's Eric. Let me start on this one. So as you've observed and we showed in the deck, we had nice top-line revenue growth, which obviously was a sweet part of our interest in them as a franchise. They are kind of leading an established franchise but they have nice growth dynamics. And that's largely because they operate in a fragmented space, right, a typical, call it $500 billion institutional asset manager may have 15 or 20 systems and subsystems and providers in everything from portfolio constructions, the compliance, the straight quarter optimization and routing to risk measurement. So it's a space that in our minds is open to strong growth by a leading player. And that's why we chose Charles River as we've been watching and scanning this space.","If you then take that and say, well, how do we think about the revenue growth synergies? Revenue synergies, we feel deliver about $80 million of EBIT over the first three years and that comes from about $270 million of top-line revenue. And then obviously we try to be conservative with the cost to serve. If you go to the buckets of revenue synergies on Page 8 that we've provided and kind of take through them, I guess, maybe the way I would answer your questions the first bucket and the last bucket are really the on Bluefin revenue synergies, so together about $100 million. And second, third and fourth of the middle buckets are really about the -- on State Street revenues. And so if you think about it that way what we\u2019re effectively doing is taking Charles River, it\u2019s got a revenue growth rate, at least based on the history, of about 7% a year. We\u2019re effectively doubling that to about 14% based on the kind of on Bluefin or on Charles River assumptions.","Jay Hooley","Alex, the thing, this is Jay. A couple of things I\u2019d add to that is, there were very few if any client termination clauses in the contracts. That\u2019s the legal side of it. I\u2019d say the non-legal side of it is, as you might expect, these are disruptive things if you wanted to change and unwind. So we think there\u2019s more than ample of time not only with the introduction of State Street as a significant provider of resources to Charles River and with knowledge of most of these clients anyway to not only secure what we have but to expand upon it.","Alex Blostein","And then just another clean up question. When it comes to synergies, I think in the deck, you guys gave 2020 run rate numbers for revenues and costs came from a timing perspective. How quickly do you guys expect how to come in?","Eric Aboaf","Alex, it\u2019s Eric. We didn't go into details of that because obviously it\u2019s going to play out overtime. What I tell you is the synergies ramp up, it\u2019s not completely linear and on the other hand it\u2019s not a hockey stick either. Obviously the first year it takes a little time to get things going, in the second year we expect a real significant chunk of expenses. So that tends to lead a little bit relative to what I might describe is a linear trend line. Revenues will go the other way early year's bills then they build on subsequent years. So hopefully that\u2019s enough just to help with the modeling.","Operator","Your next question comes to from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Quick question here on -- as a follow-up Ken\u2019s question on the common. Deal close is expected in 4Q, but do you have any timing for when you expect to issue this common and preferred and what you\u2019d expect the cost of preferred would be?","Eric Aboaf","Brennan, it\u2019s Eric. I think because we\u2019re now in this open period here, I think the larger would resist if I ask them to name a day, a week, a month. So I think we\u2019ll be on the market in Q4. It's an obviously, we\u2019re watching markets to find a good opportunity. On the preferred, I think you could probably take some of the current yields and some of the new preferred issued by other similarly sized banks or you can look at some of ours that are out there and currently some of the required yields. We do think that the market is favorable relative to some of our historic; perhaps, we've got some that are callable now. We have some that become callable over the next year and obviously we\u2019d be inclined to call the more expensive ones there.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks for that. And then thinking about one more here on the deal. The rise on revenue synergies is one that financial investors usually don't greet with open arms. So could you give us maybe a little bit more color on how you intend to insulate Charles River from maybe some of the pricing dynamics that we typically see in the trust bank world? How do you intend to allow for -- is the idea here that end-to-end will allow for greater insulation on the trust bank side? And how is it that you -- where do you expect the relationship to be owned if you're coming in front to back? Is now the ownership going to shift from the back office on the client side to the front office? Do you have any visibility on that? Thanks.","Jay Hooley","Let me start that one Brian, this is Jay. I would start with the point I made earlier which is while State Street is acquiring Charles River. Charles River as an entity will continue to exist as an independent entity with the connection with State Street. And in fact as I mentioned, we're going to push more of the product capability this front-office leading into Charles River. So the first thing is clear separation.","I think the Charles River has a series of relationships where State Street is not involved. And then State Street and Charles River have a number of -- a large number of clients where we jointly provide services. And I think we'll sought through to determine where the better relationship is. I would say generally, you'd lean more towards the front-office. And investment management firms, well, if those relationships are different the front-office tends to carry a little bit more weight. And one of the things that beyond the front, middle, back connection, which I think we all understand, I think one of the things that I think will provide upside to this deal overtime is gaining access to the front-office platform world. Some of the new innovations that we've created in our markets business around peer-to-peer lending, access to one button touch, access to specials and securities lending, to the extent that we can stream those all the way through on a highly automated basis. It's going to be differentiated. So I think the relationships will go through one-by-one determine where the lead is, but my leaning is towards the front-office from the standpoint of where the lead relationship would be. Ron or Eric, would you add anything to that?","Ronald O'Hanley","Well, the only thing I would add to that is that, I think it's important to remember the pricing was all about value delivered. And there is euro familiar as anybody with the challenges that investment managers are facing. And to the extent to which this platform is delivering value enabling them to not only cover costs but to streamline and improve their own investment process. We don't see this necessarily being subject to the same kind of commodities like pricing pressure that you see in other areas.","Brennan Hawken","Yes, I appreciate that Ron. It's just I wonder about once it's all under the same roof keeping it separated, but seems like you guys are going to try to keep separate at least initially. That's at least where it seems to me.","Ronald O'Hanley","Correct.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks. And then how about we take a refreshment twist to actually the results here this quarter? Deposit costs ticked up a bit. It looks like 13 basis points for the total deposit base. I believe it\u2019s roughly two thirds for you guys, deposits that are in U.S. dollar. So is there any noise in that, Eric? And how much of that should we attribute to the U.S. dollar deposits? And am I right in the two thirds number?","Eric Aboaf","I think the -- just to go outright, I think, deposit rates came up as if they continue to raise rates. I think these are well within the bounds of our expectations. The U.S. interest bearing deposit data was just a snitch over 50%, which we think at this point in the rate cycle, was makes a good bit of sense. We need to share some of the benefits of the industry environment with our clients. We need to keep it, sells as well to continue to build our returns. I think we\u2019re seeing good activity with clients on the balance sheet. And so, we\u2019re very well engaged with them. And I guess the other metric to keep an eye on is the non-interest bearing deposits. And we continue to see the slow rotation, but that continues to move more slowly than our internal model. So I think all-in-all, a good quarter on interest-bearing deposits given we\u2019re in the middle of the cycle. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect NII to continue to build from here.","Brennan Hawken","I\u2019m sorry, Eric. Could you walk me to the math on that just over 50% because the 13-basis-point increase would -- I would assume applies just to the U.S. dollar deposit. So I would think that based upon that the math would drive that deposit ratio -- that deposit data higher for the U.S. deposit? Isn't that right or is there some other noise that\u2019s in 13 bps?","Eric Aboaf","There\u2019s more to that. So if you and others actually go through the average interest rate earning balance sheet in our financial supplemented Page 7 for those, but deep into this. I\u2019d actually take a look at U.S. versus non-U.S. This is a domiciled view but it\u2019s directionally right. So I focus on the U.S. rate, which went from 28 basis points to 37 basis points. If you actually have all the internal data, which effectively here the data on that was effectively 50% for U.S. interest bearing deposits. Just remember the non-U.S. domiciled line has the FX swap costs in there, right, because we\u2019ve now -- in that line with footnoted at the bottom of page. And so you kind of have to -- if you want to start with that, you got to back those out and then split it U.S. non-U.S. But I just go to the U.S. line because it\u2019s the simple and more direct approach and we\u2019re off of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America.","Mike Carrier","Eric, just maybe one on the core business first. Just on the asset servicing fees, it seems like sequentially it became a little weaker, I know you had the international and their currencies weight on it. But just wanted to understand maybe for the quarter like the timing of both -- like the BlackRock and Vanguard assets, like how much was that in there and just trying to get you maybe more of a run rate. I know that\u2019s tough with the markets in the FX, but just maybe anything that kind of weight on that besides the beta?","Eric Aboaf","Sure. It\u2019s -- let me just kind of give it to you sort of broadly and then try to be as specific as possible that provides so that we\u2019ve historically felt. So I'm not appropriate to go client-by-client, win-by-win, transition-by-transition, but let me see if I can be helpful here. I think I was trying to be clear that the quarter-on-quarter change in servicing fee revenue, which is down about $20 million, was a mix of market effects and this transition of BlackRock, which we had announced, I think over a year ago. And there is always a mix of other factors, right. There is kind of underlying product mix, there is client flows, there is a better shift between the U.S. and EM and vice versa, and there is always a set of new business and business flowing through. I think just for this time and I'll probably not be terribly attempted to do this every quarter, but the effect of the BlackRock transition for this quarter was about half of the $20 million and I think that can kind of be at the least the starting point if you think about the results. ","Mike Carrier","Okay. That's helpful. And then just one more on the Charles River acquisition. So on the revenue, on synergies, like strategically or conceptually that can make sense. Just wondering like when you come up with those revenue opportunities, how much of those revenues are like new for the client, meaning new services versus how much are they currently using another provider? And when you make that assumption at the potentially shift into the Phase 3. What is that like maybe the pricing assumption? You mean you have to be more competitive to kind of allure them away from another provider. And then I don't think and this will be a huge issue just given like Charles River's client base, but from a concentration issue, when you're doing the back-to-middle-front-office, do you run into any of those issues similar to, I mean it's very different, but just similar to like the BlackRock, your move in terms of some of these assets?","Jay Hooley","Hey, Mike, this is Jay. I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Eric. Your first question which is, are these new services that they're not currently employing today? I would say largely they're not. They're using either someone else's platform or someone else's custodian or the trading with some other counterparties. So most of the synergies on the State Street side, which are almost two thirds of the revenue synergies, are areas where they've got a counterparty today who have some sense of changing out of middle-office or back-office provider of State Street becomes like a custodian or State Street has part of the custody work. And we can show a more integrated value proposition as we've seen with some consolidation that's likely that we'll see more of that. I think to the extent that we can stream trading and lending and other credit activity from the front all the way through the back, which doesn\u2019t exists today, but will exist once we get in and wire that together. They're trading with other counterparties they'll be compelled I think to trade more with State Street given the simplicity of execution and lowering of risks.","So I think a lot of this one is being done today somewhere else. And the transition and the lift it would cause one to make a change depends on the different services but it's not extraordinary in any of those different areas.","Eric Aboaf","And let me just add, it's Eric. I think if you go through the synergies, I think we tried to put some real detail on Page 8a. I think there is really a nice mix of different tax fix here. And that's why I like as a CFO, because then we\u2019ll be able to execute and measure progress on every one of them. So take the first one, scaling the Charles River front-office solutions. Some of that is taking their existing clients and moving them into our cloud and that\u2019s software as a service. And so, that\u2019s just -- there\u2019s an old way to do it in a new way. And we\u2019re going to be able to accelerate that because we give Charles River kind of an institutional credibility, right that they may not have had, right, when you\u2019re out there offering software to large asset managers. Those large asset managers want another, you\u2019ll be here for decades and decades and they\u2019ll get the next releases and so forth. So that\u2019s part of the way this works. And then there\u2019s a series of these where they have other providers, they tend to be smaller. I mentioned for the typical $500 billion asset manager is still often 20 providers, but there\u2019s a range, it could be 25 or 30. And it tends not to be a price sell because this is a software service, there\u2019s implementation, there\u2019s functionality. And if you think about the CIOs and front office portfolio managers, their expectations are quite high. And I think this relative to some of the other services in the market. This is kind of front office capability, functionalities, the narrowing performance attribution where folks want the functionality, and I think, are willing to pay a fair price. And so, I think this is one where we\u2019ve taken those kinds of risks into account in the synergy models but are quite comfortable.","The one other thing that I\u2019ve mentioned because we haven\u2019t talked about it that much is that we have put a global franchise here and Charles River has a nice U.S. franchise, I think, it developing European and Asia franchise. And if you think again, the institutional brand and reputational backing that we can bring to them as we help scale that international expansion is another part. I\u2019ve not kind of overlaid that, but there is an overlay behind it in the execution plans against these synergies that really have a progression that as I\u2019ve built out in Europe and Asia.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Maybe just to start off with the Charles River, so just looking at that in the front-office pool that you\u2019ve identified about $8 billion and Charles River share that looks like around with the $311 million, just under 4%. And then looking at the revenue synergies that you\u2019ve outlined some of that obviously is State Street revenue. But you still only imply maybe a 5% to 6% market share of that $8 billion pool. So can you talk about, you mentioned obviously and we all know this industry is incredibly fragmented and has historically been driven by sort of traders' decisions in usage of the products. Can you talk about the potential of actually increasing that market share and much more significantly? If you really believe that\u2019s a decision making move to the corporate office of the asset managers where we'll be looking to really synergize this suppose to sort of on the trading course?","Ron O'Hanley","Brian, this is Ron. We're -- we want us to be conservative here in terms of how we think about the acquisition and not overstretched. But I think that you actually implied in your question is the answer. There is -- we see this everyday with our clients. There is a real desire to simplify to take the complexity out of the fact even amongst the largest asset managers who by any definition are exceeding what they're thinking about is how do we position ourselves for scale. So I think you're right that overtime particularly assuming that we deliver on this vision of a data-enabled platform that's interoperable with our technology and other technologies that the client might choose to use. We think there is a lot of upside here.","I'd also agree with your point that the decisions -- these front-office decisions are moving in many respects at least they're centralizing to the CIO as oppose the individual portfolio manager decisions. And in many cases that's a CEO, CIO and Chief Operations Officer kind of decision that again is around the idea of simplification and long term scalability.","Brian Bedell","And the regulatory approvals, who else is -- which do you need -- which regulators need approvals some of this.","Eric Aboaf","Brian, it's Eric, just a customary approvals from the Fed. And now there is obviously we've been approved this and include as I mentioned in CCAR and received the non-objection. So that -- I think that's informative. Obviously, we keep the Fed and all of our regulators up to speed any particular activity. This is clearly one that we've been discussing with them since at least since the early part of this year if not before that. And we've gone through a definitive agreement. We feel confident that of the value here. We feel confident that we can close in the fourth quarter.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And then just to go back on the asset servicing. Thanks for the color on the BlackRock transition. Is it, if I heard you correctly, did you say the BlackRock transition was from an asset perspective halfway done? And then if they also read correctly, I think, you've only got $300 billion left to install of the $1.5 trillion to the $1.2 trillion of the new deals over the last 2 quarters is installed? And is that going to be fully in the run rate for 3Q versus \u2026","Eric Aboaf","Yes. You've got that right. You got that right.","Brian Bedell","And since you have a tailwind in 3Q from installations other than you have another half of BlackRock to canal?","Eric Aboaf","Yes. And this is where if you remember on our last call. There was a lot of questions and interrogations on who is the client will be now I would have tell you that it's Vanguard. We are quite proud of that win. I think it's quite clear in that call that there is always a range of different services that we offer, right, and both in different regions in the U.S. And so the basis point range on pricing if its custody only versus full vertical stake is quite different. And so I think I did that purposely right to give you a sense that in many cases. And I'm not going to comment on a second client now, but in many cases we start with the custody only offering, because sometimes that's the easiest one in which to start with. And then we -- for many clients, we scale that into accounting or administration or middle office or performance and analytics. And so obviously those are discussions we have on with all clients. We won\u2019t comment on Vanguard in particular. But we\u2019re excited to have them. We think they really were impressed with the automation and technology and so forth, but kind of functionality we\u2019ve brought to the custody over the last few years for Beacon efforts and they have they're on a real growth trajectory, which is also constructive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Can you give us some thinking on how you look at M&A as part of your strategy more broadly? I guess the regulatory environments moved on a bit over the last few years, which may be makes it a little bit easier than it would have been a few years ago and GE asset management, which was quite smaller now. But I was kind of curious to see how it fits into the strategy and if this could be in the several transactions we might see over the next few years?","Jay Hooley","Jeffrey, this is Jay. Let me start that one and maybe invite Ron to jump in as well. We\u2019ve -- I think we\u2019ve said over the last couple periods that the two areas where we thought, we might be all that advance our strategy through an acquisition was both in asset management where we thought there were some select capabilities if we could acquire would enhance our solutions capabilities. And we specifically characterize those as smallish. That\u2019s still an area where if the right thing came along that might be interesting. And the second area with this area that is really represented by Charles River, which is catapulting into the front office, which we\u2019ve all, we\u2019ve had a desire to do because we think that\u2019s where this business is going. And we made a big move into the front office. And so I wouldn\u2019t see other than maybe some small stuff or I\u2019ll turn it over to Ron because, what even with the rumors of State Street and Charles River coming together, you have a lot of other front office providers that are looking to engage with an interface with us. Not necessarily that we would need to acquire but we would integrate to create more functionality in the front office. So I wouldn\u2019t see anything more big on the front office, maybe some smaller capabilities and probably more likely partnerships.","Ron O'Hanley","Yes, Geoffrey. What I would add to Jay\u2019s comments is that from where we sit now, we don\u2019t need to do any M&A. And as we\u2019ve, I think, consistently said we\u2019ve got a business strategy, real growth focus in both the data analytics part of asset servicing as well as an asset management. And I think what you\u2019re seeing here is relatively focused -- in both cases relatively focused acquisitions to basically accelerate a strategy that we\u2019d already talked about. Jay\u2019s last comment there about the platform that we\u2019re creating is very important, because -- and I said it a couple times on this call. Our overall strategy even before we started talking to Charles River, has been about data and about this idea that information and information delivered in an inappropriate way and in an unusual way is the most powerful tool we can provide to the market. And as we build out this platform, which Charles River as a part where it goes way beyond Charles River, firstly, it's enabling clients, enabling us to bring lots of solutions to clients including their own solutions or including the solutions of third parties. And as we rollout more of this platform in perfective, it will be very easy for us to have a conversation with the provider like interest in us. And we don't need to buy it. They can come on the platform, we have to look at the pricing of all that. But it's a platform itself that provides the ability to bring all these things together rather than us having to acquire things to bring it together.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you. And then maybe just to follow up. You mentioned Charles River is going to stay as a separate entity. Who is going to be running that business?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, we will install a Chief Executive into that business somebody who is deeply experienced and running the software companies, the founder, will stay on in a consulting role to help us do the transition given he's got a keen interest in making sure this is successful.","Geoffrey Elliott","And you mentioned making keen interest on the part of I guess the fellows are making sure it successful. Is there any kind of announce or anything like that? Could it -- it kind of looks like a cash deal? And I guess what is that kind of tied to each of the fellows to the success of this given they're not getting State Street stocks are not going to participate in the hopeful upside of the shift.","Eric Aboaf","Let me separate the founder, who has an interest because he's built this company over 30 years. He feels good about State Street and feels good about State Streets being able to take this to the next level and he's obviously got an interest in that? It's not a financial interest, an emotional interest in it. But as you expect, we have spent a fair amount of time with the team and have put in the appropriate retention schemes to make sure that the core asset that we're buying, which is really intellects embedded and the engineers and the software designers are -- we think they're going to embrace State Street as a theme because we're going to invest in this business. This is about taking it to the next level. Ron, would you add to that?","Ron O'Hanley","Yes, what I would have add to that is that the founders here own virtually all the equity. There is very little that he doesn't own. So the ongoing retention here and the work with the team that Jay just described is there is a group of very high performing people are excited about them, they're great engineers. We have worked out a compensation plan that we think will be very attractive to them. And they like everybody else at State Street will share in their success.","Eric Aboaf","I think that probably that just one more point, Jeffrey. I mean this is a growth opportunity. I think you see it, hopefully you see it, they'll see it. I think growth in itself is exciting theme for the team at Charles River.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. Maybe to talk a little bit about 2019 impact, so maybe before we contemplate synergies if I kind of think about the before gone buyback the issuance, I guess the implied net income you expect for 2018 assume some growth. I guess putting that all together again about 3% EPS or earnings dilution. Is that a fair way to think about the numbers? Or is there anything and obviously building in the amortization in that number? Is that the right way to think about it? And if so, are you expecting to get any synergies in 18 to add to that?","Eric Aboaf","Tim, it\u2019s Eric. I think it\u2019s early days on this question. And you\u2019re -- you've just started the modeling, I think, in probably in 2, 3 hours. And you're asking this question. I think you\u2019re approaching it correctly, right. You\u2019re kind of going out. What\u2019s the earnings stream you're going to take the 2017 operating earnings? You got to adjust for some of the 606 adoptions, so you got to get that into the mix, you got to adjust for taxes and then you\u2019ve got to build a growth rate on that. So and I think you, as I covered on one of the earlier questions, there\u2019s some revenues that starts to come in but it tends to ramp up overtime expenses some in year one, I think real nice amount in year 2. So I think you\u2019ve got the pieces right. I think what I would prefer to do just to try to be more helpful is when we get to our October call for third quarter, we can give you a good indication of select quarter EPS or I guess, or kind of earnings contribution from this because by then we\u2019ll have completed the deal. We\u2019ll know the exact timing. We\u2019ll have concluded on all the financials. And then I think we\u2019ll have in a good basis either a back call or the January call. It's something that's give you some ranges for '19. So I think, I\u2019d rather take it in steps, but I think you\u2019ve got some of the components, right. And we\u2019re certainly happy to iterate with you on that basis.","Jim Mitchell","And then I think about compensation expense getting to the quarter was down quite a bit ex the charge. Is that a good run rate or was there some true up there for you mentioned incentive comp that we shouldn\u2019t annualize that kind of number that we had saw this quarter?","Eric Aboaf","Yes. It\u2019s a clear 2 part answer to that. I think on compensation expenses specifically, we did it just downward a bit for performance related incentives. We feel like we need to deliver on the financial commitments we have. We're I think ahead on Beacon and ahead on NII. And I think we\u2019re conscious of the revenue environment and see operating leverage was neutral in the first quarter bit negative in this quarter. And so we obviously match incentive with results. We think that\u2019s the way to run a company. And so there is a bit of an effect there. I think the best way to give you some indication of expenses is given we\u2019re here in the middle of the year. This is the natural time for us to think about second half expenses versus first half. I think you could take a look at what we reported in our view is. We -- and I think, I said it, we intend to keep second half expenses at about the level first half. You got to just out that that first quarter bump that you get. But that to us is the right level of expenses, but we got to be careful. We don\u2019t know markets are going to go up or down. We don't know what kind of macroeconomic environment that we're likely to operate in. And so we think it's best to be prudent on expenses.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. But should we exclude the $77 million in that comparison as well?","Eric Aboaf","For the repositioning charge?","Jim Mitchell","Right. ","Eric Aboaf","Yes. We think about that as a specific item. That address some delayering that we feel was -- is important and real valuable to do as we transition into a more global and functionalized operating model, yes.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. So you adjust that out. Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsey Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Ms. Graseck, your line is open. ","Betsey Graseck","Yes, thanks. Two questions. One question I'm getting from folks this morning is the build worse by. And I know you decided on buy, but maybe you can give us a sense as to why that made sense versus building something else like this on your own?","Ron O'Hanley","Betsey, it's Ron. I would say that we're doing both. We've built out a fair amount over the last several years, built out or brought out actually if I think about it. Lots of what we've done in Data GX. Lots of the markets platform that we built FX Connect, Fund Connect, Currenex which will all be integrated in this platform I've described. It really came down to a decision that we see so much activity here so much pull clients. And as we got to know Charles River through the work that SSGA was doing was that we felt that this would really accelerate us to market and enable us to occupy just more of the space quicker than we couldn't on our own. So it was the classic build versus buying. It was really about timing.","Eric Aboaf","And Betsey, part of the answer is the capabilities the software and the products and services, but the other part is excess to 300 clients that are kind of in our sweet spot from a standpoint of asset managers, asset owners. In an addition we pick up access to this wealth advisor segment, which is a new segment for us and it's kind of exciting.","Betsey Graseck","Okay. Got it. And then the follow-up question was just on the synergies on Page 8, a couple of them are related to streamlining and cash at synergies out of State Street's middle and back office. So maybe you could help me understand how that works because you're buying someone who is more of a front office operator. So just want to understand that.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah, Betsey, it's Eric. Let me describe those on Page 8 on the right side there is a series of different synergies. I think at the bottom of the page, right, one of them is just implementing Charles River within SSGA our own asset management is factored in something that we've been considering for over 2 years now. So if you could imagine we actually did product and functionality diligence right with our CIO and PM teams long before we even consider this as an acquisition. So and if you think about SSGA we got $1.3 billion expense base in SSGA. If you look at just technology narrowly defined, it's $100 million. And so we're looking at some consolidation benefits from simplifying that what we have built, which is decent overtime, but not at the level of what we have here, so that's kind of one example. I think when you get to the operational efficiencies at the top, remember, and the systems, remember, we have a set of middle office systems today because we are in the middle office business, and so does Charles River. If you remember the slides that Jay showed earlier on, we\u2019re both in that middle office area. For example, we both have a compliance system that helps with compliance processing. For the -- for asset managers, they have one we have one, a natural ones retired turns out that\u2019s an expensive system to run and to operate. And so just something like that is worth in the $15 million range. So it\u2019s those kinds of overlaps that exist. And then the last is, obviously, as we work on this middle office area, which is full of reconciliations and data flows in comparison as soon as we begin to offer a service that streamline some of that, there\u2019s real costs to take out. And so we\u2019re quite confident on the expense synergies there off of a relatively large base of what we do. And this is -- and it\u2019s also an area we have a lot of experience extracting efficiencies off of.","Betsey Graseck","Okay. And the data analytics piece, I know you have been building out your data analyst front end platform. I think you showcase some of that several years back at an Investor Day here in New York. So just wanted to understand if the acquisition means that those efforts then go away or just get layered on to CRD because you don\u2019t need to do that anymore? Is it -- in other words is it, is the acquisition a replacement of your internal efforts for building up data analytics platform or is it adjacent to?","Ron O'Hanley","Betsy, this is Ron, I\u2019ll take that. I think it\u2019s a little bit of both in the sense that there\u2019s some capabilities that Charles River brings that are additive. There are some capabilities that didn\u2019t have that with some what we have -- it just rounds out the sweet. And then there are some things that are by the dense back to work together. We can actually build something together that we probably couldn\u2019t build, either one of us could have built on our own. So if you think about going back to Eric\u2019s point on where the front office leads, and so the middle office would be a post trade workflow management. That\u2019s probably a space where Charles River has some tools in it, but now that they\u2019re exposed to our very large middle office business. We can build up even a better tool than they have had or include that matter than anybody else has.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.","Vivek Juneja","A couple of questions for you folks. How is Data GX service price buying folks today when you pitch it to your clients?","Jay Hooley","I would say it's -- Vivek, this is Jay. Subscription base as a recurring fee associated with add-ons, if you add custodians or expand the base, and then in addition, once you get Data GX, which is the data aggregation layer. And then on top of that, we have a number of analytic platforms that actually apply some analytics to the aggregated data and that has a separate revenue stream, which is all subscription based. All of this is recurring based on usage.","Vivek Juneja","So not tied to the rest of the middle back office contracts that you may have?","Jay Hooley","Not at all.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Ron, a question for you. I just heard you saying or maybe it was Eric, that for SSGA, your tech spending was $100 million and you're going to say $10 million hereby using CRD. So does this -- are you saying that this would cut front office costs for your clients by about 10%? Is that the right extrapolation?","Eric Aboaf","Vivek, it's Eric. I think every client will be different. We've been able to kind of interrogate our own base of expenses. You actually have to when you do the math even on SSGA of $1.3 billion our expense base. There is technology base for $100 million. There is also an operations expense base that's associated with that. And I was trying to just focus on the system just to kind of compartmentalize this and give us an estimate. But I think this could be representative of the value. And obviously, we think a value that way. We think that CEOs and CIOs are going to think about value that way. But remember this is partly an efficiency play for institutions and asset managers because they're all under examination on those fees for in the active space. But it's as much a functionality and what are the benefits and do I get the functionality that I need. And so, our view as we've got a premier property here that can help do both. And that's what makes an attractive for the range of constituents you have. And at least as an example, we think this is in the range of what someone could expect but it would depend on what they have, they build it internally, how fragmented, how many little providers do they have. And so there is probably a range around that.","Jay Hooley","And Vivek, I would just add, this is Jay, that, I do think that the cost and the efficiency is important, but if you think about our own synergy model, it's only a third of what the value is. And I think of this as giving states to access to the front office platform world. And the network effect that can be created by having a Charles River through 300 client connected to State Street's liquidity and trading engines. I think it's a pretty powerful concept. And that's just the start, that doesn't include the other relationships and partnerships that will wire into this as Ron referenced earlier.","Vivek Juneja","And as a lead time for getting these kinds of follow ups, getting CRD contracts similar to what you have to go through on the rest of your business which can be multi-year process?","Jay Hooley","Yes, let me take that. I think it depends is the answer Vivek, this is Jay. CRD is the system that has multiple components. And so when you changing out a software platform that's a careful exercise that has some lead time to it. And I would say that the short to long lead time will be defined by the complexity of the environment. SSGA is a reasonably complex environment both globally across asset classes. And I'd say once that gets lined up that's probably 1 year, 1.5 year kind of implementation cycle with deliveries along the way. It doesn't all the way and it happened in the final day.","Vivek Juneja","I guess I was trying to think off, Jay, the whole idea of pitching and winning business, which I know for traditional middle and back office as a multi-year. So that's what I was trying to get a sense of CRD so much similar.","Ron O'Hanley","Yes. This is Ron, Vivek. I think that, again, it will be quite client-specific, but if there\u2019s a situation where we're already doing a lot of transformation work with a client and working with them, for example, in moving their middle office, you could see this is being a pretty rapid add-on to that because a lot of the things that you do or if we already have the middle office, a lot of the things that would be required to plug that in, we\u2019d have already done. So I think, if you\u2019re asking one, will the pipeline build fairly quickly? Yes, probably will although to be clear what we're focused on how in the first few months after the close. We want to make sure that they\u2019re continuing to serve their existing clients very well. And then we\u2019ll add to the pipeline has it makes sense.","Vivek Juneja","Yes, because I noticed, your compound annual growth is almost 7% to 14%. So I\u2019m trying to get a sense of over what period should we expect that to happen?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, I think certainly over the 3-year time period for that, we have to, we gave you a CAGR on that, right. So the first year it'll be closer to the seven and the year, a little higher. But we think of this as mid-teens growing stream. At least as we are broaden them into our clients whether it\u2019s our U.S. clients, and I showed you the overlap data, which I think is quite striking. We can bring them into half of our top-tier clients where they\u2019ve not been able to get in the door where we know the CEOs and CIOs and then internationally. So it\u2019ll build overtime and our view is it provides a nice stream. But as Ron said, we got to be careful, right. We got a first really invest in current clients, serving them as well and building this business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Just one quick question first maybe, I'll take you back to what Vivek just asked. How long one from integration, we will actually go out to clients and say this is our end-to-end solution that we have for you. May I know how you want have deal closed in the fourth quarter, but when can you actually bring that solution to clients? Like what quarter, what year?","Jay Hooley","Brian, I would say, this is Jay. I would say we\u2019re working on this already. I think we said it a few times but the fact that SSGA is two years into -- SSGA, obviously, a middle and back office client of State Street and has been working on this for a year, has given us a chance to really understand the connect points and understand the things that can be delivered in a relatively short period of time and those things that will happen overtime. So I think it will evolve. But probably pretty quickly, we\u2019ll be able to show some linkages to the existing Charles River client base and to the State Street client base, which will show some value and it will grow over time. And I think, if you think about not only wiring this together from a State Street's standpoint, but wiring additional capabilities from other firms into this, it\u2019ll just continue to grow.","Unidentified Company Representative ","Yes, and what I would add to that is, I think the important thing to know about this client base and this segment is that, even those firms that have are starting to outsource the middle office, they haven\u2019t, most actually haven\u2019t put in an integrated solution into their front-office. So this isn't about necessarily displacing somebody else. It's often times what we're displacing is proprietary systems or spread sheets that have been built up overtime. And as we're, given again that we're working with them in the middle office, it's a pretty easy conversation to say here what's contributing to the complexity of your middle office. It has to do with your front-office and what's help you figure this out.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Great. And then maybe just one quick on the financials from the deal, Eric, you mentioned that the CET1 dilution was 50 basis points. But can you help us break that down. I don't know if I recall what the total intangibles were from a deal. I don't know if there would be any RWA impacts from the deal? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah, it's Eric. I think the easiest way to think about this is $2.6 billion of goodwill and intangibles, right, and obviously all those are deducted from capital and a regulatory reporting. And so we've developed a fully kind of ratio neutral financing of equity on the other side. So that those -- that could go on intangibles. So if -- Brian, if everything was contemporaneously -- it'd be neutral in Tier 1 capital and leverage capital basis and that would be that deterioration on the set 1 ratio. I think the next part of that is overtime, there is a mix of goodwill and intangibles. The intangibles come through expense base unless the deduction is lower. And then if you can just model it out based on, I think, we've given the intangible split is roughly 800 to 900 over the 10 years. And I think you can just work through on a model how that plays out. And so that will come through our expense base, but the deduction from capital will come out. And that will play through kind of a classic multi-year model, but we can surely help you with offline.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard Cassidy ","I apologize if you've asked this question I jumped on late. I understand that you're going to keep Charles River separate, as a separate entity and I'm assuming they're not a bank holding company or any do not have a banking license. Are there any regulatory issues that you have to address with them as you integrate them as part of your bank holding company? Any added costs or anything like that because they're not regulated by the bank regulators today?","Eric Aboaf","Gerard, it's Eric. Within the financial guidance that we've given you here on revenues or cost to deliver the revenue and the expenses, we've actually factored in what you've usually have to do to take a private company and put it into a public setting. So I think there is a usual work we have to do on the accounting and auditing and financial reporting side for the various implementations that we have. And then we got the same thing on the more bank regulatory side, clearly, it has grown from safety and soundness standpoint and data security and so forth at the level that you'd expect a bank of our size and scope to have until we get back to that.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And then the second, I know you've given us some good data about the revenue synergies on Slide 8. And the internal rate of return that you guys calculated and the expectation that this was accretive. With a run rate today of your total revenues of about $12 billion, it seems like, and this happens in other acquisitions for your company and others that these benefits are hard for investors to kind of extract down 2, 3 years down the road to see if it\u2019s really working. Are there any objective measures that you can share with us that we should look at that we can really see that? Yes, this deal was a great deal or no it\u2019s not coming as expected. Aside from what you\u2019ve given us in this slide, since again, they can blended into your regular numbers?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, I think, Gerard, we\u2019ll be doing exactly you\u2019d like to see, right. Because we need to make sure that we extract the value from this acquisition and it\u2019s not just combined with other activities. Now, like you say, it\u2019s not a perfect science to do that. But our perspective as each one of these, because there are 5 buckets we\u2019ve given you, they\u2019re actually dozen buckets behind that, I think that we'd like to track. But take them by example, the liquidity services that we put against the platform. That comes through and defined revenue streams against defined clients and through specific systems that we need to track, actually just book it on the GL in the right way and that should be something that we can trace back, we need to trace it back just for our own data lineage standpoint. And so that\u2019s the kind of thing we can share. I think wealth management is compartment. I think if you go back to the top of the list, we talked about converting additional clients from the on-premises to cloud application that we will be able to find clients, client counts, what were they, what are they now, what\u2019s under implementation, so with some view of the trajectory. So we\u2019ll do everything we can. We\u2019ll be doing it, anyway, internally, right. And we\u2019ll certainly find ways to share that with you on some kind of regular basis to bring it together. I think if you step back though, at the end of the day, I think we've given guidance as to what we think our underlying growth rate is before the acquisition. We did that in January. And that gave you some sense for how we think of the toxicity and accounting and management businesses, end markets businesses to grow. And our perspective is this can add percentage point on top of that. But we\u2019ll do everything we can to show you with the transparency that\u2019s possible whether we\u2019re achieving it or how we end up at what pace.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill.","Jeffery Harte","Good morning, guys. Most things have been covered, but just a couple. Can you talk a little bit about the revenue terms in the front office space now? I mean, is this potentially big offering, but I\u2019m kind of wondering how that compares to your more traditional businesses were from the outside. We kind of still calculate the fees as a percent of assets under custody continuing to decline?","Eric Aboaf","I\u2019ll start Jeff and maybe ask Ron to weight in. I think that, if I compare the back, middle and front, I would say the back office pretty mature as far as the set of services and the set of competitors. The middle office, maybe, 40% of that outsourced today. There\u2019s more to go. I\u2019d say the front office is even more immature. And that, and Ron referenced this earlier the front offices are up and running, but the pressure that people have feeling to consolidate systems get that data replaced, all tier proprietary systems caused us need to say the front office is probably has the most explosive growth opportunity in it. We size the market at a billion but I would say from a standpoint of change, churn and growth, the front office has the most attractive growth of those three segments. Bur Ron, what would you think?","Ron O'Hanley","I'd agree with that Jay. And Jeff, what I would add is that, if you think about it, many of the kinds of tools and capabilities that we're now able to offer in the data space. They just weren't able to be offered 5, 10 years ago in terms of particularly some of the Big Data analytics and the unstructured data analytics kinds of tools. So you're creating basically -- it's a relatively new market with new offerings. And as Jay noted, in many cases you're taking things that either weren't being done or were being done in a fairly primitive way in the front office and now putting it together in a much more industrial strength kind of data analytics and platform package.","Jeffery Harte","Okay. And in client retentions, can you talk bit about, a) how important it is and b) the financial impacts? I mean our retention packages and things like that included in $200 million of acquisition and restructuring costs?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, it's Eric. Yes, absolutely. There is about $50 million that we put aside for that kind of that the talent that we're bringing on. And we're we'd like to expand on that talent actually overtime because that's what's going to drive additional growth in the business. So that's the important part of the $200 million that we summarized there.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Eric Aboaf","Thanks, Lisa, and thanks everybody for joining us this morning. We look forward to providing you an update in October after the third quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Now, I would like to introduce Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at State Street.","Valerie C. Haertel","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Our first quarter earnings materials include a presentation that Jay Hooley, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Resch, our Chief Financial Officer, will refer to in their remarks. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP or operating basis measures to GAAP measures referenced on this webcast, as well as other materials can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Before Jay and Ed begin their discussion of our results, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street's 2012 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC.","We encourage you to review those filings, including the section on risk factors, concerning any forward-looking statements we make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, April 19, 2013. The corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.","Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Jay Hooley.","Joseph L. Hooley","Thanks, Valerie. Good morning, everyone. Before I get started, I just want to acknowledge the horrific tragedy that's beset our great city this week, and just say that our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone that's been impacted through this event.","As Valerie noted, our remarks will follow the financial highlights slide presentation that we issued with our earnings press release this morning. And I'll focus my comments on our operating basis results and primarily on the sequential quarter comparisons since those seem to be of most interest you.","I'm pleased with our first quarter financial results. State Street benefited from stronger-than-expected equity market performance and increase in foreign exchange market volumes and continued strong expense controls across the organization. We continue to bring on new business and our pipelines remain strong.","If I take you to Page 3, on an operating basis, first quarter 2013 earnings per share was $0.96, which is a decrease of 14% from the fourth quarter of 2012 and an increase of 14% from the first quarter of 2012. It's important to note that the first quarter of 2013 included the effect of $118 million pretax or approximately $0.19 per share after tax of equity incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes.","Our revenue was slightly higher than the fourth quarter and was 2% greater than the first quarter of 2012, driven mainly by improved equity markets, higher trading services and new business, including the Goldman Sachs acquisition, offset by lower net interest revenue.","Our core fee revenue comprised of asset servicing and asset management fees increased about 2% to $1.4 billion from the fourth quarter of 2012 and more than 9% from the first quarter of 2012. Importantly, we produced positive operating leverage of 130 basis points compared to the same quarter last year due to our strong expense management. And if you exclude the effect of the first quarter 2013 equity incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes, we achieved positive operating leverage of 145 basis points for the quarter when compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.","Before I review some additional financial highlights, I'd like to share some thoughts about the strong equity market performance in the first quarter and provide you some color on client investor behaving -- investing behavior.","As I previously discussed on both the fourth quarter earnings call and on our Analyst Day in February, we saw signs of client rerisking at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012, and it continued as we began the year. As the first quarter progressed, client risk-taking behavior moderated somewhat, but it's still running ahead of prior years.","While the environment overall feels better, we remain cautious to the ongoing fragile state of global markets. As you're aware, the low interest rate environment weighs at our net interest revenue, and together with high levels of client deposits, our net interest margin. At this point, the Federal Reserve continues to signal its attention to maintain low interest rates for the foreseeable future.","If I turn to new business, the first quarter 2013 new asset servicing wins totaled $223 billion, which is comparable to the $233 billion in new wins that we reported in the first quarter of 2012. Of the $223 billion in new asset servicing wins this quarter, about 2\/3 were from within the U.S. and 1\/3 from outside the U.S. Also included in our new business wins are 39 new alternative asset servicing mandates, a client segment that continues to present good opportunities.","With respect to the remaining installation of 2012 new assets to be serviced of $551 billion, approximately $70 billion remains to be installed in 2013. Additionally, approximately $43 billion of the asset servicing mandates won during the first quarter have not yet been installed.","Among those clients installed this quarter are the U.S. dimensional funds managed by Dimensional Fund Advisors, an investment manager with over $260 billion of assets under management through it and its affiliates. We're providing a full range of services for this client including accounting for U.S. strategies, custody and securities lending solutions. This is a great competitive win for our U.S. global services team.","Additionally, State Street Global Advisors total assets under management increased 4% to $2.18 trillion in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, driven by strength in the global equity markets and net new assets to be managed. Within our ETF business, strong markets fueled a 5% increase in our ETF assets under management to a record $354 billion at March 31, 2013, compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.","Net client inflows were $5 billion in the first quarter driven mainly by securities finance cash collateral pools. We experienced net ETF outflows of $6 billion from both our gold ETF amidst declining gold prices and from our S&P 500 ETF, which historically has outflows in the first quarter as institutions reposition their risk profile in the market.","These net ETF outflows were partially offset by a strong start to the year in Europe, where we've been focused on expanding our ETF product offerings and inflows into SSgA's sector -- select sector ETFs in the U.S.","Looking ahead, our business pipelines in both asset servicing and asset management remain strong and well diversified. Higher revenues in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 were driven by strength in trading services offset by lower net interest revenue. And by the way, I've moved to Slide 4 now.","In trading services, foreign exchange trading revenue for the first quarter increased 24% to $146 million from the fourth quarter of 2012 due to higher volumes and increased volatilities. Securities finance revenue increased about 5% in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2012 due to slightly higher volumes.","Our operating basis net interest margin was 131 basis points in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 136 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2012, partly due to the higher level of client deposits, which Ed will explain in a minute.","If I turn to expenses, we continue to control our expenses effectively across the organization. Operating basis expenses increased about 6% in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding the effect of the equity incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter, expenses actually declined over 1% from the fourth quarter. And compared to the first quarter a year ago, expenses increased 1%.","Our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program remains on track to deliver the highest level of pretax expense savings for the program of $220 million in 2013, and we continue to expect our transformation program to deliver approximately $575 million to $675 million (sic) [$625 million] in run rate savings for the entire program by 2015.","Turning to capital on page -- on Slide 5. Our financial strength and disciplined approach to capital management have enabled us to maintain consistently strong capital ratios under Basel I and the proposed Basel III standards based on our understanding of the proposed rules.","As we reported in mid-March, the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2013 CCAR plan, which included our planned capital distribution program. Following the CCAR results, our Board of Directors approved a $2.1 billion common stock purchase program through March 2014. We completed our previously announced $1.8 billion common stock purchase program in February 2013. Additionally, in February, the board approved a $0.02 per share increase in our common stock dividend, which is now $0.26 per common share payable to shareholders this month.","So in summary, we're focused on creating value for our clients and shareholders, growing revenue, diligently controlling expenses and distributing capital to our shareholders, which remains a top priority.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ed, who will provide additional details on our financial performance.","Edward J. Resch","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comments on Slide 7 of the earnings presentation, which shows a summary of operating basis results for the first quarter and unless noted separately, I'll be referencing only operating basis results.","Revenue was up slightly in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 and up 2% from the first quarter of 2012. The first quarter demonstrated our commitment to controlling expenses. Expenses increased 5.7% from the fourth quarter of 2012. However, excluding $118 million of equity incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes, expenses were actually down 1.2%, and we achieved 145 basis points of positive operating leverage in the sequential quarter comparison.","Compared to the first quarter of 2012, we achieved 130 basis points of positive operating leverage. Earnings per share of $0.96 decreased 13.5% from $1.11 in the fourth quarter of 2012 and increased 14.3% from $0.84 in the first quarter of 2012.","As you may recall, there were several items totaling approximately $36 million on a pretax basis or $0.06 per share that favorably affected our results in the fourth quarter of 2012. The first quarter of 2013 included a negative impact of $118 million on a pretax basis or approximately $0.19 per share of equity incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes.","Return on equity of 8.9% decreased from 10.3% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and increased from 8.6% in the first quarter of 2012. We purchased approximately $360 million of our common stock during the first quarter at an average price of $54.95 per share, resulting in approximately 463 million average fully diluted common shares outstanding during the first quarter, a reduction of 4.7 million average shares in the sequential quarter comparison.","Now let's turn to Slide 8 to discuss first quarter operating basis revenue drivers. Servicing fees increased 2.2% to $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2013 from the fourth quarter of 2012 due to stronger global equity markets and higher transaction volumes. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, servicing fees increased 9% due to stronger global equity markets, net new business and the acquired Goldman Sachs Administration Services business.","Management fees at SSgA increased to $263 million in the first quarter of 2013 from $260 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to stronger global equity markets and net new business, partially offset by lower performance fees. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, management fees increased 11.4% primarily due to stronger equity markets and net new business.","Performance fees in the first quarter were approximately $4 million, down from $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 and up from about $3 million in the year-ago quarter. Money market fee waivers were approximately $6 million in the first quarter, up from $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Total trading services revenue increased 15.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, driven primarily by strength in foreign exchange revenue and electronic trading. Foreign exchange revenue increased 23.7% from the fourth quarter due to both higher volumes and volatilities. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, foreign exchange revenue decreased by 2% driven by lower volatilities, partially offset by higher volumes.","First quarter 2013 electronic foreign exchange revenue increased 28% and 16% from the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2012, respectively, driven by an increase in volumes of 33% and 35%, respectively. Securities finance revenue was $78 million in the first quarter of 2013, an increase of 5.4% from the fourth quarter of 2012 due to slightly higher volumes. Securities finance revenue decreased 19.6% from the first quarter of 2012 due to lower spreads and volumes.","Securities on loan averaged $313 billion for the first quarter of 2013, a slight increase from $305 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012 and down 5.4% from $331 billion in the first quarter of last year due to lower overall demand. Processing fees and other revenue in the first quarter of 2013 decreased 18.3% from the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to a gain of $10 million from the sale of a Lehman Brothers-related asset recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Processing fees and other revenue in the first quarter of 2013 decreased 16.1% from the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to a $24 million positive fair value adjustment recorded in the first quarter 2012 related to our withdrawal from the fixed income trading initiative.","First quarter 2013 net interest revenue of $577 million on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased 3.8% from $600 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to lower yields on earning assets. Fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue in the first quarter of 2013 decreased 4.9% from $607 million in the first quarter of 2012 due to lower yields on earning assets partially offset by lower liability costs.","As we have noted, higher-yielding fixed-rate securities in our investment portfolio are maturing or paying down and being reinvested at lower rates while floating-rate assets are resetting at market rates. Our net interest margin declined to 131 basis points in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 136 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 152 basis points in the first quarter of 2012. The decline in our net interest margin is the result of both the decrease in net interest revenue and an increase in average earning assets. The increase in average earning assets is driven by the higher-than-expected levels of client deposits we saw in the first quarter. If the current levels of client deposits continue for the full year 2013, our average earning assets will likely grow between 3% and 7% compared to the 2012 full year average, and our operating basis net interest margin will likely be around the low end of the 130 to 140 basis point range, assuming interest rate spreads and prepayments fees remain at their current levels through 2013. This compares to our previous guidance of interest earnings assets growing to a range between 1% and 4%, and our operating basis net interest margin to be in the range of 130 to 140 basis points.","Turning to operating basis expenses on Slide 9. In the first quarter, we continue to control expenses. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, we reported negative operating leverage of 544 basis points. However, excluding the effect of expenses related to equity incentive compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes, we achieved positive operating leverage of 145 basis points. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, we achieved positive operating leverage of 130 basis points.","As you can see on the slide, compensation and employee benefits increased 13.1% in the first quarter of 2013 from the fourth quarter of 2012 due to the effect of the $118 million of equity incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes. The first quarter of 2013 included the impact of the targeted reduction in force we announced on the fourth quarter earnings conference call. To date, we realized approximately 10% of the expected $90 million in annual savings, which is on target with our plan. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, compensation and employee benefits expense decreased 2.7%, partially due to the savings associated with the execution of the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program.","First quarter 2013 information systems and communication expenses increased 1.3% and 24.1% from the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2012, respectively. The increase in both periods was due to costs related to transition activities in connection with the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program, as well as costs to support new business. These expenses are expected to increase slightly over the next few quarters and then level off.","The Business Operations and IT Transformation Program continues to be on track. For 2013, we expect to achieve approximately $220 million in incremental pretax expense savings, resulting in approximately $418 million of cumulative savings. Consistent with our initial forecast for the entire program, we expect to achieve run rate, pretax expense savings in the range of $575 million to $625 million by 2015 compared to year-end 2010, all else equal. Our nonrecurring expenses related to the Business Operations and IT Transformation Program were approximately $25 million for the quarter. We expect these nonrecurring expenses to trend lower this year and in 2014 as we near the completion of the program.","Lastly, other expenses decreased 7.9% from the fourth quarter of 2012, driven by lower professional fees. Recall also that the fourth quarter of 2012, other expenses included a $14 million onetime Lehman-related client recovery recorded in that quarter.","Now let me give you some details on our investment portfolio including some highlights from the first quarter. As I outlined in the top half of the slide, Slide 10, the key elements of our strategy remain unchanged. Our investment portfolio decreased slightly to $116 billion as of March 31, 2013, down from $120 billion as of December 31, 2012. We have a solid credit profile with approximately 88% of our portfolio securities rated AAA or AA. The duration of the investment portfolio was 1.7 years as of March 31, 2013, unchanged from December 31, 2012. We will continue to manage the portfolio with a target duration of around 1.5 years but there will be periods of time where we're slightly above or below that target depending on our investment priorities.","As of March 31, 2013, 54% of our investment portfolio was invested in floating-rate securities and 46% in fixed-rate securities. The aggregate net unrealized after-tax gain in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of March 31, 2013 was $817 million compared to a net unrealized after-tax gain of $698 million as of December 31, 2012. The improvement in the quarter was due primarily to narrower spreads.","During the first quarter, we invested about $4.5 billion in primarily AAA-rated securities at an average price of $101.22 and with an average yield of 1.05% and a duration of 1.82 years. Of the $4.5 billion, we invested approximately $3 billion in both U.S. and non-U.S. asset-backed securities and the remaining investments were spread among various asset classes.","The duration gap of the entire balance sheet as of March 31, 2013, was 0.41 years, up from 0.36 years as of December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily in response to a steepening of the treasury yield curve from 2 years to 10 years.","Turning to capital. Slide 11 has a summary of our strong capital position. As of March 31, 2013, our Tier 1 common ratio was 16.1%. Our estimated pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III NPRs, as we currently understand them, was 10.6%. Also, as of March 31, 2013, the estimated pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III NPRs, including estimated effects of scheduled runoff and anticipated reinvestment of the securities affected by the SSFA through January 1, 2015, was 11.4%.","Note that the Federal Reserve's rules implementing the Basel III capital requirements, including underlying capital models, are not yet final and are therefore subject to change, and that the finalization of these rules may result in changes to our projected Basel III ratios. Our capital distribution plan reflects our strong capital position.","As a percentage of 2013 consensus earnings, State Street's capital plan is the highest of the 18 bank holding companies that participated in the 2013 CCAR process.","So to summarize, solid first quarter results were supported by increased total fee revenue over the fourth quarter and a continued commitment to prudently manage expenses. We continue to expect the effective tax rate on an operating basis for the full year 2013 to be generally consistent with the last 2 years in the range of 23% to 25%.","Finally and importantly, we will continue to optimize our strong capital position and expect to return capital in the form of common stock purchases and dividends.","Now I'll turn the call back to Jay.","Joseph L. Hooley","Thanks, Ed. Let me briefly close our call with 3 points. First, in the first quarter, we delivered good results amid rising equity markets in a persistently low interest rate environment; we continued to aggressively manage our expenses while maintaining a high quality of service to our clients; and we remain confident in the secular trends that underpin the prospects for growth in our business, and I believe that we're focused on the right value drivers.","With that, Lisa, we'll open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Thanks for hosting the call, I know it's a challenging week up in Boston, Jay. My first question is a question of balance sheet size, Ed. Just given all the puts and takes to begin the year that you and Jay walk through, I was hoping you could comment from where you are now, what would you characterize is seasonal and frictional rather than the impact of new core business installation?","Edward J. Resch","Well, that's a little hard to say. I think it's a combination of clearly some new business, but it's also, I think, a combination of the world being fairly awash in liquidity. I think we're seeing some of the customer deposit flows because of that, because of both factors really. I mean, we saw average deposits up about $6 million over Q4 and TAG had the effect of bringing deposits down about $7 billion, which was in line with what we expected. So we're seeing, I'd say, more liquidity, a greater increase in Europe. The non-U.S. deposits are, we think, awaiting reinvestment. And I would say that that's probably in the temporary category, to your question. But in the U.S. we're seeing deposits up around $1 billion, but that's net of the TAG outflows, so we've seen about $8 billion of USD inflows. We're also seeing another trend, a little bit of a trend, I guess, where the U.S. deposits, half of them are coming into interest-bearing accounts which we think, again, is a reflection of excess liquidity being available in the marketplace, hopefully awaiting reinvestment, but looking for some investment that is obviously safe and relatively market yielding.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then shifting over to securities lending. I realize the business isn't is as large as it used to be. But we saw a seasonal lift but maybe not as much as we see in the past. Could you just talk through your current outlook for that business and maybe latest thoughts on some of the rule proposals we're hearing out of Europe?","Joseph L. Hooley","The seasonal lift, Howard, you mean the dividend season? Is that what you...","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","No, I just meant 4Q to 1Q. I know that we usually see a bump up, Jay, just with the new year.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes. Yes, I think there is some bump up although, as you know, the dividend season, which is the real cyclical high quarter is about to come on us in the second quarter. But I would say generally, securities lending, balances have stabilized in the low-300. I think if you look at quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year, the effect of the downward pressure on revenue has been largely the Fed fund to 3-month LIBOR rate. So I would suggest that the business is kind of in a stable state, I think, waiting for a pickup in merger and acquisition activity which will have a positive effect on that and further leverage in the general financial services system would be catalyst for growth, in addition to any widening of spreads.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the second part of the question, Jay. Just thoughts on the rule proposals coming out of Europe, any latest views.","Joseph L. Hooley","I think it's too early to tell. I think that there's a number of things that are circling around securities finance. But our outlook is really unchanged as far as the business continuing to be a good business for us over time. As the rules firm up, that may change, but no view as of today.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","First question I have is I'm just curious, if I look at the assets under custody and administration and clearly you've had some tailwind of favorable markets in new business. But I mean, the pension assets, the pension products there have been relatively flat for several quarters. And I'm just curious, I mean, could you address maybe what kind of mix you're seeing? New business wins coming mainly in kind of fund products and maybe it's the pension clients, where you're seeing some runoff of the clients or business?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, it is a real mix. This quarter, which was -- I think, last year, we had total assets, new asset service of $1.2 billion, this quarter was $230 billion, so kind of an in-line quarter from a longer-term trend standpoint. 2\/3 U.S., 1\/3 non-U.S., that's a little bit different than what we've seen in the past. But I guess, more to your sector question, pension's kind of stable. We've had some good new business wins there, no losses that I'm aware of, so kind of a net positive. But as you know, in the pension segment, it's a pretty stable segment. Most of these are DB-oriented funds that aren't getting new flows. So on the other side broadly, the funds business, U.S. and non-U.S., obviously benefits from flows and all those things that happen when clients rerisk. And that pipeline and the successes have been very good and as you know in many markets, including the U.S. where a little bit of significant market share leader, and I think we continue to gain on that leadership. I just draw a little bit of a line under Dimensional Fund Advisors, which is a very significant U.S.-based, but with global products in the asset management space, and converting that business this quarter was a big win for us. And we would hope that they will continue to succeed. And with the success, we'll benefit from it as well. So again, we pretty diversified. The only other segment that I would call out would be the alternative segment, which -- and you see this in broad-based flows or asset growth. The alternatives continue to grow. And for us, the growth is twofold. It's -- we grow as the funds grow, we grow as we competitive -- we're successful in competitive new business wins, but also a good deal of that particularly private equity and real estate segment is yet well [ph] source. So that's why I continue to call it out because that should continue to be a ripe area for growth for us.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just my follow-up. It's for Ed, this is a question in -- possibly it's that not big a deal and may be hard to quantify. But I'm just curious, I mean, I know in the -- probably in the ETF business and some of the funds business and maybe even net interest revenue, there is a little bit of an impact from day count just there being a few -- a couple fewer days in the first quarter. Is there any way of quantifying what that impact is on revenue at all?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, there is. I mean, we think about that frankly more from the perspective of net interest revenue. I don't have that number at my fingertips, Rob, but absolutely, there's an impact in terms of day count. We're looking for the number now. I don't know if we have it immediately available. I could certainly follow up with you after the call.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Ed, I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about just on the servicing line side, did you have any negative impact from FX translation this quarter? And can you -- Jay, I heard your comments about starting rerisking in the beginning quarter and then a little bit of tailing at the end. But just kind of what were the core drivers of the servicing line? It certainly was up nicely, but not as much as it seemed like people were looking for, so what are the key drivers?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, let me start that, Ken. Well, I was looking for a number here. So servicing is up, I think, 2.2% sequentially, 9% year-over-year. So a good year-over-year growth, decent sequential growth. You'll also note that the first quarter is a pretty big installation quarter for us when you think about what was left from last year and what we installed that we committed in the first quarter. So I think on the rerisking, Ken, if I were to walk you through kind of a monthly scenario, which largely mirrors what you see in the U.S. mutual fund industry. We exited last year, December was kind of a peak quarter that traveled through January, February and March, tailed off a little bit, but still running stronger than we've seen in prior years. So I guess the other little nuance would be that as opposed to a rotation, which is flows out of fixed income and into equities, it's been more coming out of cash products. And I suspect not just money funds but other bank cash products has been fueling the little equity run that we've had here. So it's been kind of a tumultuous couple weeks here in the global environment. We'll see what -- how the rest of the quarter plays out, but it does feel a little bit different than years past with regards to some level of resiliency in investor behavior even though we've come off of the peak of the December, January months.","Edward J. Resch","Yes, and Ken, the answer to your question in terms of currency effect on total revenue, it's fairly immaterial. It's about $10 million down sequential quarter and $14 million down year-over-year first quarter to first quarter. So not much.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then my second question, just kind of a similar question on the asset management fees -- on the fee -- on the asset management fee side because there you did the -- also positive flows, positive AUM growth. I was just wondering, was there any delta in either performance fees, or why did that line not grow more sequentially given the better backdrop than the AUM growth?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes. So that was -- sequentially, it was fairly muted year-over-year, up 11%. The flows within the story would be positive on the security finance-led cash collateral pools. The FX -- the ETFs was a little bit of a mixed story, so we had -- as we've been telling you, we're creating and innovating new products in Europe and the U.S. We saw some good growth in Europe. But the offset was you've seen gold prices and therefore, we've seen some outflows into gold, so that was a little bit of a negative on the ETF side. And you also -- we typically see year end a little bit of a run-up in the S&P 500 ETF, which came off in the first quarter. So those are kind of the quarter-to-quarter trends that occurred. I point you a little bit to the 11% year-over-year and say that we feel pretty good about how that business is progressing. We think we're in some of the sweet spots of the market, passive and ETFs, in particular, albeit, there was a little bit of a muted quarter-over-quarter growth in management fees.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","First one is just a quickie on the average balance sheet. The biggest driver, I think, on the NIM decline is the decline in the other investment line. Just curious, down, what, 16 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Just curious what is producing the biggest drop there.","Edward J. Resch","Those are loans we have out to custody clients, collateralized loans that are driving that, as well as our Boeing [ph] investment, nonportfolio assets.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And what's -- is it just utilization that's the biggest driver of the movement because...","Edward J. Resch","Yes, it's episodic.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","It's episodic. But it's episodic in size, but also you're saying the runoff and that just pushes the yield down.","Edward J. Resch","Yes.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Other one was, just curious if you can frame even in round numbers what the Goldman acquisition added to revenues, expenses and thoughts -- early thoughts on client and revenue retentions thus far.","Edward J. Resch","Yes. I mean, Goldman is -- the acquisition is progressing right on track. We announced that and said it was about $120 million annual revenue business with a margin in the range of 30% to 35%, and it's right on track. And in terms of client revenue retention, we're exceeding the 90% target that we put out for every acquisition that we do. So nothing but good news on the Goldman Sachs Administration Services acquisition.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, that's good. And it sounds like it might have been a modest contributor to the positive operating leverage, but the core is still there and good.","Edward J. Resch","Absolutely. Right on both counts, Glenn.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just to go back to the core servicing line. Ed, you mentioned $10 million revenue impact from foreign currency translation. Is that mostly in the servicing line? And then, if you could talk a little bit about the pace of installations. You've installed the large DFA business during the quarter. And inclusive of the other installments from the very strong fourth quarter, should we expect a lagging benefit as we move into the second quarter on the servicing line?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes. The -- it was, as I mentioned earlier, a pretty strong installation quarter given the tail of what was left from 2012 and implementing a good deal of what we committed in the first quarter. In the case of DFA, not completely installed but a good chunk of it installed and should layer in, I think, through the course of the second quarter. So kind of all else equal, yes, we should see the benefits of that roll forward as we move through the year.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great, that's helpful. And then my follow-up would be just on the balance sheet investment strategy. I know that you highlighted a 1.05% reinvestment yield. It's a lot lower than the fourth quarter. I guess, is there any change in strategy in terms of trying to shorten the duration or improve the credit quality that's driving that compression? I know the yields are down in general, but that seemed like a larger drop than I was expecting for the reinvestment.","Edward J. Resch","Yes, no change in strategy, Brian. We're of the same mind that we've always been, which is investing through the cycle and keeping the portfolio in the range roughly 50-50 fixed-rate and floating-rate. And it's just a question of the market opportunities that we saw in the quarter, so no change there. Back to your earlier question, about 1\/3 of that $10 million effect is in the servicing fee line for the quarter.","Operator","And your next question comes from line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you could help us reconcile, I guess, what you're seeing as far as the environment and what's going on with the servicing business, I guess, versus what we're seeing which is the revenues. So, Jay, I guess on the one hand, you described a little bit of a better risk appetite environment and clearly better markets, and it seems like the middle office in the alternative solutions continue to win a largest share of total business which again, feels like all should result in higher fee rate. Yet we haven't seen that, and it doesn't sound like in the near term that's going to improve. So I was hoping you could help us reconcile that and maybe it's the other part of the business that is maybe seeing more pricing pressure, or the business that you guys are winning doesn't seem to be all that different from a pricing perspective relative to kind of like the a core custody business.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, So I think that's a multi-headed question, although I do -- I continue to remind you of the sequential quarter versus year-over-year, where there was good service fee growth. So I think some of this can't be read into a specific quarter-to-quarter comparison. But generally speaking, the environment, I think the pipelines are good and I think that's a reflection of -- in the asset management world and the alternative world and then the pension world, the asset-owner world, clients are continuing to outsource more work to us. We continue to do better than hold our own with regard to -- on the competitive front. We're continuing to introduce new products to differentiate our service offering. And in concert with that, the pricing environment, I don't think it's changed much, but we've become more disciplined with regard to bidding for new business, with regard to making sure that we're extracting a fair economics from our customers for the value that we're providing. So I think that begins to frame it. I think the risking behavior, as I said, has been episodic but better than last year. And I think if you look at the year-over-year 9% increase in servicing fee, some of that is reflective of a better risk environment. I think that the thing that we're all waiting for and hoping for is that this follow through not only on the move to equities, which we've seen some evidence to, but at some point, you're going to see flows come out of fixed income into equities. And I think that given our position particularly in the asset servicing for asset manager space, we have expectations that that's going to be a good thing once that starts to happen, hasn't happened yet.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then on -- just wanted to go back for a second on the ETF activity we're recently seeing with your business. It seems like first -- second quarter to date, total AUM is down in the $14 billion-ish range and a lot of is yield-driven. I was hoping you can maybe give us a sense of on a net basis, what does that to do to your earnings? I know it's not big numbers, but I think the fee rate that you guys collect on the actual management is a little bit higher relative to what the net impact is because I guess of some of the expenses. But just kind of help us understand that $14 billion of outflows you show in the ETF business, what the net impact of that could be.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes. So to begin with, not really material, but if you look at that GLD product, we share management fees with the Gold Council, and I think we're in a 14 basis point-ish range for what we -- the revenues that we derived from that, so that gives you a little bit of sense of the dimension of the effect.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I see on Slide 7 of the presentation, you're now including the pretax operating margin, so I see that increased -- I know it's your focus. But I'd like the extra presentation, and that's my question. So if you back out the accelerated options expense for the quarter, that pretax operating margin on the Page 7 goes from 26% to what? I guess it goes to 31%, is that correct?","Edward J. Resch","About right, yes.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then your goal, as pointed out, I think, in Slide 36 from your Investor Day presentation, you talked about the core margin in 2010 of 27.5%, your goal is to improve that by 400 basis point. So your goal is 31.5%. So it's 31% core this quarter, and your goal is 31.5%. And then if you have about $400 million of additional savings from the IT project, all-in, if it drops -- just reduce expenses and that's it, I get a number of 35% pretax operating margin. So if you can correct my math or if you can caution us about potential headwinds you're concerned about as for the reason not increasing that target.","Edward J. Resch","Well, I mean, we put the 400 basis point margin target out there, Mike, predicated on 2010's results and as caveated by saying all else equal and obviously, all things are not equal. It's always a little bit dangerous to take a quarter and project it out over a multi-year program. I can't disagree with the math you ran through in terms of -- if you excluded $118 million of expense from the quarter, the margin would be higher. But however, that expense would have to be recognized over the succeeding quarters and years. I mean, our normal amortization period is the vesting period for those awards. So the expense would be over the next 16 quarters, okay? So you have to recognize there are some moving pieces here and to look at the first quarter and say, we're already at or close to our program target is, I think, a bit of a leap. Now we're not signaling by that answer that we think the target is not achievable. We believe we're going to get the $575 million to $625 million out of the expense base, but that's going to occur over time, and we would expect the margin to improve over that period of time in line with what we originally said, not looking at just the first quarter.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, just making that 1 adjustment if we spread that over quarters you said, 31%, I guess, should be 30% this quarter and 34% once you have all the savings just by the math. So my follow-up question is, your goal is to become the low-cost producer. What would you perceive as a pretax operating margin for the low-cost producer in the processing business?","Edward J. Resch","Well, I mean, we've been reluctant to put a number out there for what the low-cost producer is or on our operating margin target other than to quantify what we think the effect of the program will be on the margin, again, all else equal, predicated on 2010. I mean, clearly we think we're making good progress on the project. Clearly, we think we're improving the margin. I think you can see that through the first 9 quarters of the program and its implementation. But to date, we have not put an operating margin target out other than what we've said about its effect on the -- the program's effect on the margin.","Joseph L. Hooley","Mike, the other thing I might add to that is the -- we do aspire to be the low-cost producer in those activities that have become more standardized and commoditized in the business. And we think that our IT and ops transformation program is aimed right at that. Additionally, by layering in the cloud environment, we also think we're able -- be able to be a lead producer of new products and new capabilities in this business. So the goal is really to make sure on those core activities that we do have the lowest unit cost in the marketplace, but we're continuing to invest through the cloud environment to make sure that we're differentiating our products so that we can have pricing power on the other end. I mean that's the magic combination is to be the -- you have the lowest unit cost but also be the most effective innovator on the product side. We think that's the best combination for us going forward.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","You were targeting NIM of 1.3% to 1.4%. Now you're kind of pointing to the low-end of that range. It's only Q1, you're already at 131. So I'm trying to gauge your confidence that you can maintain that guidance going forward.","Edward J. Resch","We're pretty confident, Luke, that if, in fact, the assumptions that I articulated relative to portfolio size and balance sheet size and customer deposit levels, prepayment speeds, et cetera, play out, that we'll be able to hit within that guidance. And remember, we're talking about our expectation for the year being a net interest revenue decline in the range of $150 million versus 2012. So we're confident that will be able to do that given those assumptions.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then I want to return to Alex's question on middle office. Given your commanding market share there, it doesn't seem to be a commodity service at this point. So it's sometimes confusing that you've communicated that the fees you charge for that don't look much different from the back-office outsourcing. You said you're getting paid fairly for their value you provide, but can you just remind us why you can't charge more for this suite of services.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes. Luke, we don't, in any single instance, offer middle-office servicing as a standalone. So it's -- I view it as it's an enhancement to our overall bundle of services. And you're right to point out that we have a significant market leadership in that, which translates into when we're competing for new business, we do well. We compete very effectively because we have the best capabilities. And the more differentiated you are at the point of sale, the more you can hold price. So I think that that's how that translates. I think in very complex opportunities that have a middle-office component, we're highly successful where we attract -- where we really want to win the business and pricing is pretty good because we're differentiated.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe one micro question, one big picture question. The micro question is just on expenses. The drop in other category was really noticeable even apart from the unusual expense in 4Q. So you guys mentioned professional fees is the main factor in that. Is that a sustainable level, or would that bounce back seasonally or with some projects that you plan?","Edward J. Resch","Well, our focus has been very significantly on that line among others. But in the fourth quarter to first quarter decline, we did have a lower level of professional services. We're not expecting the professional services spend the bounce back to what was in prior quarters, but it may increase somewhat depending on the situation, okay? There are consulting costs in there, for example, for evaluation of regulatory initiatives, things like that. So there may be some increase in the future, maybe it's more of a timing question to some of these expenses from -- that went down in the first quarter, but it's absolutely a line that we're looking at very hard and are trying to make sure that we do not see a rebound in that expense line above what we think is absolutely necessary to comply with the regulatory initiatives, for example.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then bigger picture, you mentioned you're focused on growing your ETF business in Europe. And I'm just wondering if you could give some color on that, talk about -- are you targeting certain market shares, certain parts of that market, certain products? What is your strategy over the next few years to be bigger in Europe?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes. So I would add to that, Cindy, Asia, as well, but a little bit more focus on Europe. So the strategy is to participate in an evolving market opportunity. And I do think, when you look at the ETF business globally, the world is -- Europe is underweight in ETFs, and so we're starting to see those opportunities unfold. And I would say that the way we get at that is really twofold. One is through introducing differentiated product to the market. So we've introduced, I think, it's 40 products over the last 18 months. I'd say creative and innovative products, which are commanding higher fees. So part of our strategy is to not be as much in the commoditized end of ETFs, but be in a differentiated end. A large part of which revolves around the portfolio strategy. But equally important and sometimes not understood, there's a distribution into that. So the distribution in Europe is largely through private banks and other intermediaries. And as a result, we've added wholesalers and distributors in Europe, so that's part of the buildup. I think that's largely in place, so it comes to continuing to introduce new product and distributing it through those wholesalers. So we think the opportunity is emerging, and we think we're well positioned for it. And I would say Asia is a story that's a few innings behind that whole story, but the same thing should unfold.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Foran with Autonomous Research.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I guess, I hope this doesn't come across as like too simplistic a question. But if I just think about 30 years of trust bank data, not just you but the whole industry, I mean, it just seems like the operating margins have always been about the same level. And I guess, if you step back and think about these as scale businesses and all the investments in technology, why isn't there at some point in the future kind of a step-change up in operating margin? It just seems like for a lot of investors maybe part of the frustration with the whole industry, certainly not you alone, is the benefits of scale never seem to have accrued?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, so let me take a swing at that, Brian. I think for a long period of time, decades, these were growth businesses where markets were growing, new products were being introduced, and there was plenty of opportunity to grow top line and there was enormous need to invest infrastructure domestically, globally, product-wise. I think part of that run-up on the revenue side introduced market-driven revenues to that mix. And then if I just pick a point in time, the last 5 or 6 years, postcrisis, market-driven revenues have declined for all the reasons that we all know. We've all been working on, I'd say, as an industry adjusting to a lower growth environment, which means -- my interpretation of it means we need to get more efficient. We need to be that low-cost producer in that core activity, yet there's still an enormous need to invest in the business. So I think we're -- for State Street, I'd say we're working through a period, where we're adjusting to a lower growth rate, which we think is more temporary than permanent. And there's a lot of things that we spoke about change in environment, whether it's rerisking or some of the market-driven revenues improving. A point to NIR is just a specific and important one. As we get our infrastructure more designed for lower growth environment and the environment changes and we stay disciplined on the cost side, then we think we can change the mix going forward. So I think that's a little bit of where we've been, and I think the transition of what we're doing in this period is trying to become -- is becoming more efficient, more effective. While still investing in the business, we think that, at some point, it will cycle out, and we'll see improved environment, and we'll be in that improved environment with an improved infrastructure. So that should give us the opportunity to generate more returns, which will bring to the bottom line and invest to further distance ourselves from competition would be kind of my streaming thought on that.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","And one follow-up on OCI. Do you think, as we move forward with Basel III ratios and maybe with a rate backup scenario and future stress test, OCI will kind of change in any way, be potential for buybacks in the future? And within that, did regulators think about OCI on short-duration securities books the same way they do on longer-duration securities books? It just seems like even in the severe interest rate stress scenario, a lot of the OCI risk in your portfolio would fix itself in 1 year or 1.5 years.","Edward J. Resch","Yes. I don't know exactly what the regulators think. I tend to have a view that OCI is OCI at this point. It doesn't really get differentiated between longer-term and shorter-term securities. At least, we haven't really heard anything to that effect. The issue of OCI on a go-forward basis and its potential effect on buybacks, I mean, there is information submitted as part of the CCAR, which does include Basel III-related information. I mean, the official test and the statistics published are Basel I, but the regulators do view our balance sheet under a Basel III regime. So the mark obviously in the Basel III capital ratios is included. I think too, from our perspective, the potential for its inclusion on a go-forward basis with the rules not yet being final, Brian, is one of the main reasons why we put a 200 basis point cushion on top of our 8% requirement, which includes our SIFI buffer. It's because of that uncertainty in part that we've done that. So I guess the punchline is that we need to see what the final rules ultimately are, and we'll look at those and formulate a view on what our Basel III Tier 1 common target going forward should be.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a quick question on the cost saves from the cloud investment. You're expected to have a $220 million benefit to earnings this year, and I'm just wondering how much of that was used up this quarter.","Edward J. Resch","Well, we achieved about $50 [ph] million of the $220 million in the year. I think a linear view of that achievement is what we expect and would expect to see roll through the succeeding quarters of the year, Betsy.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Josh Levin with Citigroup.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","With all the work you've been doing on expenses, how much of your core cost structure would you say is fixed versus variable, and how would that compare to maybe 1 or 2 years ago?","Edward J. Resch","Well, again, it's always a question of what time frame, Josh, right? And I think that probably the best way to think about is over a relatively short time frame, i.e., a couple of quarters, maybe a year. And we can look at a couple of different lines on the income statement and talk about them in terms of how much is fixed and how much is variable. I mean, the largest one obviously is the compensation line, and that is a function of how many people we have, and we've been taking action on that line over the last couple of years given what our view of the revenue environment is. So you could say, at least, a portion of that is variable given the assumption of a year or so time frame. I think that the other line that we've been looking at very carefully over time is the other expense line. Some of that is actually not really very variable given that there's some amortization of intangibles in that line, for example, which are based on prior acquisitions. But there are other expenses as we had in the first quarter that are in fact variable, which are the professional fees that we had a very good performance on as we've noted. And then maybe in between that is transaction processing, which can vary with market levels and transaction volumes. Usually, we have offsetting movements in revenues, so it kind of nets to a profit if the transaction servicing line goes up. There's a revenue item that's up more than that, and the converse is also true. But I'd say, overall, it's an expense base which over a short to intermediate term, while has some variability is for the most part, a fixed cost expense base. I'd be hesitant to put a percentage on it, but that's how we think about it. I mean, I would put another statement out there, which is our IT expense, which is both people and machines and licensing fees, and we can move that over time, and I'd say over -- again, the year's timeframe. Between the operating range of 20% to 25% is -- which is what we target of expenses, so that's a number that's in the range of $1.4 billion per year, that includes people. So that can be moved around, and that's a function of demand and regulatory imperative certainly lately and the need to continue to invest in the business and develop new products.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. A week or 2 ago, you made an announcement you're appointing a new senior executive to work on. I think it's sort of a big data initiative. I was wondered if you could talk about the size and timing of that opportunity.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, sure. It was -- we introduced a new set of services under global exchange. And you're probably right generally relate it to big data. I think the -- within our business, within our businesses, we have a number of different products and services, which are analytical in nature, data-driven analytics for risk management, for performance management compliance, and we've decided to pull those together into a separate unit so that we could focus more directly on what we think is a pretty big opportunity, which is more in the middle office space. I'd say middle-office and front-office space on the back of our middle-office position, and more and more of our clients as we listen to them are challenged by the need to rationalize their data to make it more available on a real-time basis. And in many cases, we are the ones that have that data. So we formalize the structure that we think will launch us into that space, and we're pretty excited about it, but it's going to take some time to sort out exactly how we position the strategy. But we've given it some heft with the existing structure so that we'll have some ability to invest in this new area. And it is -- it does have a big data orientation to it.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I just had a quick follow-up on the expense side. Your compensation expense, I know, Ed, you talked a lot about the other line, your compensation composition expense is down 2.7% or 2.8% year-over-year. Given your outlook on the revenue front, assuming that stays the same, I know it can be tough with -- incentive comp bounces around. But do you think that kind of year-over-year decline is sustainable for the rest of the year, or it's too early to be able to give any kind of guidance there?","Edward J. Resch","I think it's really too early. I mean, obviously, we're pleased with the 2.7%, again, reflective of the achievement on the Ops and IT program, as well as the effect of the reduction that we announced in the fourth quarter. But I think it's too early to give you an answer to that question right now.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then on -- just one last on the deposits. Have you seen further deposit outflows in the second quarter, or given your kind of discussion on average earning assets, are you seeing it kind of stabilize here, and that's part of the issue?","Edward J. Resch","We're seeing it fairly stable.","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.","Now, let me turn it over to Jay.","Jay Hooley","Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. I\u2019m pleased with our first quarter 2015 results, which reflect strong fee revenue growth over first quarter 2014, continued momentum of our core business, and our focus on managing expenses. We continue to prioritize returning capital to our shareholders. During the first quarter of 2015, we completed the final phase of our $1.7 billion common stock purchase program announced in March of 2014 with the purchase of 6.3 million of our common stock. In addition, our board of directors approved $1.8 billion common stock purchase program following the Federal Reserve board\u2019s 2015 CCAR process. ","Our 2015 capital plan also includes a proposed increase on our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.34 per share starting in the second quarter of 2015, which our board will consider in May. ","Now I would like to provide a brief overview of economic and market developments and how our business was affected. The first quarter was characterized by further monetary policy easing in several jurisdictions outside the US. Some of the moves were anticipated, but a few were not. Not only have these policy changes tended to support global equity markets, they have also contributed to higher volatility, particularly in the fixed income and foreign exchange markets. Recent weekly US economic data and Federal Reserve board members public commentary, have brought into question expectations for the timing and pace of interest rate increases in the US later this year. ","However, the wave of global monetary easing by major central banks outside of the US has reinforced the trend of diverging monetary policies and continues to fuel the broad appreciation of the US dollar. Combined with ongoing political uncertainties across Europe, managed as well as floating exchange rates are being significantly pressured. Both the Russian and Brazilian Central Banks abandoned their intervention programs, while the Swiss National Bank abandoned its cap on the Swiss Franc Euro rate and moved interest rates deeper into negative territory. In addition the Central Banks in Australia and Canada also reduced interest rates to help their economies absorb lower commodity prices. These actions spurred an increase in FX volatility. ","Monetary policy easing also impacted the fixed income markets in the first quarter. The ECB\u2019s announced an expanded asset purchase program, was larger and longer lasting than anticipated. Combined with the Swiss National Bank\u2019s moves, a significant and growing share of European sovereign bonds now have negative yields, which in turn is helping suppress yields around the globe. Together, these trends impact our business in several meaningful ways. First and most significantly, the low interest rate environment continues to negatively impact our net interest revenue and net interest margin as our higher yielding portfolio investments mature or experience pre-payments and then those funds are reinvested in lower yielding investments. ","Also, amidst the various Central Bank actions and changes to various market structures, we continue to experience high levels of deposits. As you know, we recently imposed charges for holding Euro deposits, which compensates us for the use of our balance sheet in a negative rate environment. We have also began a comprehensive program to further reduce our excess deposits, given the negative effect of these deposits on our capital ratios to better align our and customers\u2019 interests in the management of our level of deposits, given the new regulatory requirements. Second, our foreign exchange trading revenue was quite strong in the first quarter and we benefited from the higher volatility in the foreign exchange markets relative to Q1 2014 and Q4 2014. Our broad range of foreign exchange trading platforms continue to serve us well. ","Finally, our first quarter 2015 fees avenue was negatively impacted by the strengthening US dollar, which was mostly offset by the favorable impact on first quarter 2015 expenses. Excluding these impacts, our core business performed well, benefiting from both the current relationships and continued expense discipline. ","Now I\u2019d like to discuss our asset servicing and asset management business. Our focus on developing and delivering solutions to serve clients\u2019 evolving needs, continues to position us well against global growth trends. Our first quarter 2015 net asset servicing wins totaled $215 billion, and importantly these wins are across sectors and geographies. New assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods totaled $336 billion at March 31 and we continue to see deep and diverse pipelines. ","In our asset management business, we experienced net outflows of $38 billion during the first quarter of 2015, driven by net outflows of $27 billion from ETFs, reflecting the first quarter seasonal outflows from our S&P 500 ETFs, $8 billion from institutional mandates and $3 billion from cash products. Outflows were driven primarily from lower yielding products -- lower revenue yielding products as evidenced by asset management revenues for the first quarter of 2015 being up from the first and fourth quarters of 2014, excluding the impact of a stronger US dollar. ","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the first quarter and after that we\u2019ll take your questions. Mike?","Mike Bell","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I\u2019ll comment on a non-operating charge included in our 1Q \u201915 GAAP basis results. We recorded an after-tax charge of $150 million, or $0.36 a share for 1Q \u201915 to increase our legal accrual associated with indirect foreign exchange matters. This accrual pertains to indirect FX matters which we\u2019ve disclosed over the past few years, and it reflects our intention to seek to resolve the outstanding claims asserted in the United States by federal governmental entities and civil litigants. It is possible that we will not be able to reach any settlement of these matters and the cost of any resolution could materially exceed our accrual. Our current efforts, even if successful, may not address all of our potential legal exposure arising out of these activities and other claims, which may be material, could be asserted against us. As I am sure you can appreciate, settlement discussions are confidential, and we are not able to make more specific comments on these matters at this time. ","Now please turn to page seven in the slide presentation where I\u2019ll begin a discussion of our 1Q \u201915 operating basis results. Operating basis EPS for 1Q \u201915 increased to $1.17 per share from $0.99 in 1Q \u201914 and decreased from $1.37 in 4Q \u201914. Our first quarter results in 2014 and 2015 included the seasonal effect of deferred incentive compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. Compared to 1Q \u201914, EPS growth of 18% was driven by strong fee revenue growth, well controlled expenses, a favorable effective tax rate and the impact of our common stock repurchase program. ","Operating basis total revenue increased 5%, with associated total fee revenue increasing approximately 7% from 1Q\u201914, while operating basis total expenses increased 1% from 1Q \u201914. Our operating basis effective tax rate for 1Q \u201915 was 28.4%, which is lower than our expectation for the full year. ","On the capital front, in 1Q \u201915, we purchased approximately $470 million on our common stock, completing our March 2014 common stock repurchase program. In addition, we announced a new common stock repurchase program of up to $1.8 billion, and subject to approval by our board of directors, a planned increase of our quarterly common stock dividend, for 2Q 2015 to $0.34 a share. ","Slide eight shows we delivered strong 1Q \u201915 operating basis EPS growth over 1Q 2014. Primary drivers included strong fee revenue growth and the impact of our common stock share repurchases. ","Turning to slide nine, I\u2019ll now discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for 1Q, 2015 and notable variances to 1Q \u201914 and 4Q \u201914. First I would note that the stronger US dollar adversely impacted total fee revenue by approximately $83 million compared to 1Q 2014 and $46 million compared to 4Q 2014. Net interest revenue was also negatively impacted by the stronger US dollar by approximately $14 million compared to 1Q \u201914 and by $7 million compared to 4Q \u201914. Compared to the year ago quarter, all fee revenue lines increased, with the strength in FX trading in particular supporting the 7% total fee revenue growth from 1Q \u201914. ","Servicing fees were up from 1Q \u201914, primarily due to net new business and stronger US equity markets, partially offset by the impact of the stronger US dollar. Management fees increased 3% from 1Q \u201914, primarily due to net new business and stronger US equity markets partially offset by the impact of the stronger US dollar. In addition, 1Q 2015 included money market fee waivers of approximately $11 million. ","Total trading services revenue in 1Q \u201915 increased significantly from 1Q\u201914 and 4Q '14 due to higher foreign exchange trading revenue, reflecting higher volatility in volumes. Securities finance revenue increased approximately 20% compared to 1Q \u201914, primarily due to increased new business and enhanced custody and higher volumes. Processing fees and other revenue were flat with Q1 2014 and decreased from Q4 \u201814 primarily due to lower earnings from joint ventures and lower revenue associated with tax advantaged investments. ","Moving to slide 10, as you can see, our operating basis net interest revenue and net interest margin continue to be challenged in the prolonged low interest rate environment. NIR decreased from Q4 \u201814 primarily due to a one-time loan repayment in Q4 \u201814 and the impact of lower market interest rates, partially offset by higher deposit levels. We continue to expect 2015 NIR to perform within the scenarios we communicated at our Investor Day. For your reference, we\u2019ve provided those slides in the appendix of the slide presentation along with the primary drivers and assumption underlying those scenarios. ","To remind you, the first scenario assumes interest rates remains static and deposits remain level with 2014 year end levels. Under this scenario, we expect operating basis net interest revenue for 2015 to be in the range on $2.07 billion to $2.17 billion. The second scenario we presented to you assumes that administered interest rates will begin to increase later this year. Under this scenario, we expect short term market interest rates to increase in advance of the increase in administered rates. We estimate that operating basis 2015 net interest revenue in this scenario to be in the range of $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion. ","And before discussing 1Q 2015 expenses, please note that we continue to target our operating basis total fee revenue growth to outpace our operating basis expense growth by at least 200 basis points for the full year 2015 relative to 2014. This assumes that we achieve our operating basis total fee growth object of 4% to 7% in 2015. ","Moving to slide 11, you can see on the top of the slide there were some notable expenses affecting 1Q 2015 results. The stronger US dollar benefited total expenses by approximately $77 million compared to 1Q 2014 and $39 million compared to 4Q 2014. In addition, 1Q 2015 compensation and employee benefits, those expenses increased from 4Q 2014 primarily due to an incremental $137 million associated with seasonal deferred incentive compensation for retirement eligible employee and payroll taxes. ","Lastly, other expenses included $20 million in securities processing costs and an additional $8 million for a new bank levy in Europe. Other expenses increased from the year ago quarter primarily due to additional required regulatory costs and higher securities processing costs. Compared to 4Q 2014, other expenses decreased, primarily due to the non-recurrence of a number of 4Q 2014 other expenses and lower professional services costs. ","Turning to slide 12, I'll provide a brief overview of our March 31, 2015 balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to evolve as we respond to regulatory changes, including the liquidity rules. Our liquidity coverage ratio is currently above 100%. In addition, the investment portfolio maintained a higher credit quality profile and our duration was in line with the prior quarter. Lastly, the after-tax unrealized mark-to-market gain as of March 31, 2015 was $699 million, which improved from year end, primarily due to a decline in interest rates and title credit spreads. ","Now turn to slide 13 to review our capital position. As you can see, we remain well capitalized which has enabled us to accomplish a top priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. As of March 31, 2015, our fully phased-in capital ratios have declined modestly relative to year end. The decrease in the common equity tier 1 ratio under the Basel III fully phased in advanced and standardized approaches, which principally due to the Q1 2015 charge associated with foreign matters. The fully phased in holding company supplementing leverage ratio, decreased from 4Q 2014, principally due to a higher average balance sheet as of March 31, 2015 and the 1Q 2015 charge associated with foreign exchange matters. We are comfortable we have the levers that will enable us to be in compliance with the supplementary leverage ratio requirements in advance of the January 1, 2018 effective date. ","Returning capital to shareholders continues to be a top prior as evidenced by the capital actions included in your CCAR 2015 capital plan. As we communicated at our Investor Day, leverage ratios continue to be our near term binding constraint and this was further highlighted by our DFAST 2015 and CCAR 2015 results. This constraint has been driven by the growth in our balance sheet, primarily as the result of higher client deposits. ","While operational deposits are integral to the overall service that we provide our custody clients, growth in excess deposits has pressured our capital ratios and we\u2019ve began a program designed to reduce the level of excess deposits on our balance sheet. For example starting in April, we increased the rate we are charging for Euro deposits. Based upon our discussions with clients, we are also developing other initiatives that appropriately balance our clients\u2019 needs with our economic and regulatory objectives. Overall, we are targeting a net reduction in excess deposits over the remainder of the year. In addition, we continue to plan our capital action carefully and as previously disclosed, we plan to issue approximately $750 million of preferred equity in 2015. ","In summary, our 1Q 2015 results were driven by strong fee revenue, well controlled expenses and a favorable effective tax rate. We continue to focus our key priorities of delivering value-added solutions to our clients, investing in growth initiatives, diligently managing expenses and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to expect 2015 total operating basis fee revenue to increase 4% to 7% compared to full year 2014 and we continue to target our operating basis total fee revenue growth to outpace our operating basis expense growth by at least 200 basis points for the full year 2015 relative to 2014. We expect NIR headwinds are like to continue as illustrated within the scenarios we communicated at our Investor Day. Lastly, we continue to expect our operating basis effective tax rate to be approximately 30% to 32% for the full year 2015.","And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Jay","Jay Hooley"," Thank Mike. Brandy, we are now -- Mike and I are now available to handle questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Shirr from Evercare ISI","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks very much. I guess the balance sheet is up 9 % thereabouts year on year, so it\u2019s good for supporting net interest income while the NIM has its issues. But as you mentioned, it impacts the capital and SLR. So curious to on how you\u2019re balancing that. And then related question is I noticed that mortgages and asset backs had declined the most somewhere between 10% and 25%. Is that just straight runoff or is that a purposeful decline to impact the capital ratios as well? Thanks","Jay Hooley","Glenn, let me start and then Mike will comment on the balance sheet construction. This issue of growing deposits and the pressure on our capital ratios, let me just tease out for a minute how we\u2019re approaching that because I think it's important. We are working with our customers. We\u2019ve had series of discussions. So we\u2019ve brought out into the open the concern we have is somewhat ironically the clients, particularly in the asset management segment, have the same issues. SEC and other regulatory agencies are forcing them to do more liquidity stress testing on their portfolios, which is one of the causes for excess deposits ending up on our balance sheet. ","We have -- we\u2019ve developed some tools just recently through our global exchange business, portfolio stress testing tools that we\u2019ve been sharing with our costumers so that as they look at their liquidity needs, it can be done more scientifically. We are working with them to want to understand their liquidity needs and we think from that will come a reduction in their liquidity needs, which will reduce the deposits that end up on our balance sheet. I point that out because I think it's as more durable and sustainable approach than just forcing down excess deposits. ","I also think the other thing that is in play here obviously is at some interest rate level, we want these deposits. So what we are really trying to unearth what deposits are truly excess, not needed for the liquidity needs of the fund and deposits that would likely run off anyway in a different interest rate environment. That\u2019s a little bit of where we are in our deposit strategy. Based on that, as Mike pointed out, we would expect our excess deposits to go down between now and end of year, but you might comment, Mike on the portfolio construction.","Mike Bell","Sure, absolutely. Good morning, Glenn. Glenn, first, regarding the overall balance sheet and then moving into the portfolio. Regarding the overall balance sheet, we published at the end of first quarter an SLR on a fully phased in basis at the bank of 4.8%. And as we\u2019ve talked about previously, we do expect to be able to manage the levers between now and the 1\/1\/18 effective date to get that 4.8% up to at least 6%. And as Jay talked about, some of that will come from the excess deposits leaving us. Some of it will come from some financial engineering that we can do between the bank and the holding company and some of it we would expect to meet through pref issuance, including the $750 million that we have slated for 2015. Your arithmetic is accurate. I would just point out that we continue to feel good about the levers that we have in front of us. ","On the specific question on the balance sheet, the short answer is that the runoff in the mortgage backs and asset backs are in fact by design. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not lost on you that the regulatory environment now, specifically the combination of the LCR and the SLR converge to basically encourage us to move towards more of a barbell kind of approach so that as an example we\u2019re holding more U.S treasuries, more Central Bank deposits than we\u2019ve done historically. At the other end it\u2019s not huge, but we have for example a modestly larger loan book, including leveraged loans in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range. As a result, in the new environment, the piece of the portfolio that becomes then less valuable from a net return on capital standpoint tends to be the mortgage backs and asset backs that you described. So we would expect that as we over time move to more of this barbell kind of approach, that those would be the assets that are most likely to run off.","Operator","Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Josh Cohen","Good morning guys. This is actually Josh in place for Ken. What was the impact from activity levels on the servicing business this quarter?","Mike Bell","Josh, it\u2019s Mike. Regarding the GS fees, they were down a little bit relative to Q4. It was not huge, but they were down modestly Q4 to Q1.","Operator","Your next question is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao","So on the excess deposit reduction, can you just help us think about the size of these deposits and what yields these are carried at and invested in right now?","Mike Bell","Ashley, good morning. It\u2019s Mike. Regarding the deposits, first of all we estimate at on average in Q1, that our excess deposits were approximately $54 billion. And on average, those are earning in the -- again on average something in the high teens so call it 15 to 20 basis points of spread on those deposits. So if you back that out of our overall interest earning assets, you would see that the 101 basis point NIM would be a combination of high teens on the excess deposits and then something in the high 120s in terms of the core net interest margin on the remainder.","Operator","Your next question is from Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research.","Luke Montgomery","I was wondering if you could give a sense of what the year over year expense growth would've been excluding FX translation. I think obviously the reported numbers look pretty good, but maybe you could speak more to the core execution on expense containment. And then what was the impact of FX translation on revenues and net income?","Mike Bell","Sure Luke. It\u2019s Mike. Regarding your first question on expenses, so the reported expense number on an operating basis was up 1.3% on a year over year basis and again that\u2019s Q1 2015 to Q1 2014. If we take out the $77 million that I noted in my prepared remarks on the impact of the currency translation, it would say that the expenses would have been up 5.4% on a constant currency basis. And as you can imagine, that\u2019s roughly offset. Not completely offset, but roughly offset by a similar impact on fees. So the impact on fee revenue year over year was approximately $83 million of headwind, Q1 2015 to Q1 2014. And then the impact incremental to that from net interest revenue of the stronger US dollar was approximately $40 million. So $40 million Q1 2015 to Q1 2014. So if you take the $40 million of negative impact on NIR and take in the $6 million delta between the impact on fees and impact on expenses, that would say about $20 million was the headwind to earnings from the currency translation. So relative to a constant currency calculation so call that a little less than $0.04 a share.","Operator","Your next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Good morning everybody. So on the -- just taking a step back just a bigger picture I guess on the operating leverage, you guys had delivered pretty nice operating margin expansion year over year despite the currency headwinds. It looks like up in about 200 plus basis points year over year. But in your outlook for the full-year again for the whole Company your outlook remains kind of no operating leverage assuming rates stay at current levels, which increasingly feels like it will be the case. So I guess my question is, is the reason for not coming out with a little bit more optimistic guidance for the full year on the operating leverage a function of look, we don't know where FX trading is going to go and that's really been the main driver? Or is there something else we need to account for in the back half of the year that could take some of that upside out of the run rate?","Mike Bell","Sure Alex. It\u2019s Mike. First, you\u2019re absolutely right. No change in the full year outlook relative to what we had just talked about 60 days or so ago at the Investor Day. Basically that\u2019s because at this point we really wouldn\u2019t over weight a single quarter. For example we think it\u2019s unlikely that the FX trading revenue will continue at the pace that it did in Q1. Generally the conditions for FX have been good, but I wouldn\u2019t characterize the first quarter rates which were exceptionally strong as being the new run rate going forward. So that\u2019s really the main punchline is no change in the underlying outlook, which again we view, Alex as being favorable with 4% to 7% fee revenue despite currency headwinds of somewhere between 200 and 300 basis points. That would say 7% to 10% fee revenue growth on a constant currency basis. We view that as a positive result. ","And as we talked about at the Investor Day with at least 200 basis points of daylight between fee revenue and expense growth, we view that as a real positive step forward in terms of productivity. Again even a bigger step forward than we took for full year 2014 relative to 2013. So again in terms of the items we can control, we feel good about the outlook. Obviously we cannot control all the market interest rates. As you noted correctly, that remains a headwind. We also acknowledge that the tax rate is likely to be higher for 2015, in fact higher than what it was in first quarter. That would be another headwind that is not truly within our control. Again we feel good about the outlook and do not feel like it made sense at this point to change it.","Operator","Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank, please go ahead, sir.","Brian Bedell","On the investment servicing like, Mike can you tell us with the dollar amount of the FX impact is 4Q to 1Q? And then Jay maybe the amount to be installed from the new custody wins at the end of the first quarter? And then maybe just an update on your enhanced custody efforts within securities lending as well.","Mike Bell","Good morning, Brian. In terms of the Q4 to Q1 roll forward, GS fees were negatively impacted by currency translation by approximately $27 million. So it would have been essentially flattish Q4 to Q1 without the currency translation. Jay?","Jay Hooley","Yeah, let me pick up and I\u2019d just remind you, Brian that 2014 to 2013 service fees were up some 9%. So we don\u2019t look at a single quarter as being terribly informative. The $336 billion of committed not yet installed, hard to characterize it any one way. It\u2019s a real mix of from traditional to offshore alternatives. No single big deals. It\u2019s not an 80\/20 so that\u2019s good. It should feather in nicely over the next couple of quarters would be our expectation. On the enhanced custody, which drove a good deal of our period over period securities lending growth, we continue to see great interest in that product and it\u2019s coming from I would say some smaller products coming from new relationships. More of it is coming from expanding existing relationships and we find with the continued changing landscape in the investment bank world with prime brokers that enhanced custody continues to be a very attractive product. So we would anticipate that product to continue to growth and probably dominate the incremental growth in the securities lending line for some time to come.","Operator","Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja","Jay, I have a question for you just stepping away from earnings a little bit. Looking at your proxy when I look at the ROE targets for long-term incentive comp plans for management, you're using a 9% ROE target for this year and you earned 9.8% last year. So I'm trying to understand the rationale for the target that's being used being lower than last year and what to imply from that.","Jay Hooley","Sure, Vivek. As you know, I can comment on it, but that would be the board and the executive comp committee that sets those targets. I think what\u2019s notable about that target is that it continues to move up. It doesn\u2019t have upside beyond the 9%. It does have downside at the 9%. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the board and executive comp committee continue to calibrate that number up, but are also mindful of the continued variation with regard to capital and some of the things that we\u2019re working through. So the expectation that that would move closer to 12% to 15% target over time, but for now the board is most comfortable with targeting that at 9%.","Operator","Your next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Good morning. Just want to \u2013 Jay, I think in the past you've talked about how emerging market equities can have maybe a little bit of an outsized impact on fee rates. Obviously emerging markets over the last month or so has had a very strong run. Think up 9% so far in April. Is it fair to assume that can still have a positive impact on fee rates in the second quarter if it's sustained? Or is it not just market appreciation, we also have to see flows? Just if you can just give us any kind of red box to think about this impact going forward if it's sustained?","Jay Hooley","Sure. Happy to, Jim and your observation is on target, which is emerging market asset growth is a good thing proportionally as it relates to our asset growth and service fee revenue. You\u2019re also right that the last month has been very constructive for emerging markets growth and we would expect that if that continues, that would be a positive helper to the service fee line. Less influential, but important as well is the transaction volume that is associated with that. Transaction volume was a little soft in the first quarter, which is part of the drag on the service fee growth period over period. Again I\u2019d expect that if we see sustained upward movement in emerging markets the transaction growth will flow from that. So both positive towards the service fee growth.","Operator","Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Good morning. Jay, you announced a new head of the SSGA business. I wondered if you could give us a few words on expectations and maybe speak within that to the commentary in the press about focus on fixed income ETFs.","Jay Hooley","Sure. We did announce, Betsy that Ron O'Hanley will be replacing the retiring Scott Powers. Scott will retire sometime mid this year and Ron is on board as of now. Ron, many of you would know, previously was at Bank of New York Mellon running the asset management, wealth management practice and then was President of Fidelity most recently. I\u2019ve known Ron as a customer, as an industry associate through the years and when Scott informed me that he wanted to retire, I began a conversation with Ron. That conversation was largely around SSGA\u2019s positon, its strategy, what I thought the opportunities were with that and I found Ron to be similar minded with regard to how we viewed the SSGA opportunity. Scott and Ron worked together for some years in a past life. So that makes the transition even smoother as they work together. ","So with Ron on board, my expectation is that obviously with a new person, you look at strategy, but I would expect more tweaks to the adjustment as opposed to overhauls. I think what Ron and I find attractive about the SSGA franchise is its global nature, its institutional relationships and its end product areas, most notably ETFs and passive that continue to generate proportionally higher flows than the traditional active asset categories. I would say Ron loves the ETF franchise. He\u2019s a big believer in asset allocation overlays across ETFs for use in intermediary channels, institutional channels. The fixed income ETF which you referenced is also an area that we have been building out, but there\u2019s more to do. So I think that Ron coming on board, I expect that the transition will be smooth. He\u2019ll bring some new ideas to the mix, but fundamentally we have a similar view of how we can best leverage the SSGA franchise going forward.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo","Hi, you guys are batting cleanup this quarter among the trust banks. Year-over-year operating leverage is a little bit more negative than your peers. And so I'm just wondering from your perspective why do you think that's the case? Is it, one, maybe the mix? Maybe it's just the impact of Europe for more equities. Would it be two, maybe the stage of your strategy? I know you are investing a lot in the digital enterprise. Maybe you could get some ins and outs from that. Or third, you think you\u2019re not executing as well as you'd like? Thanks.","Jay Hooley","We don\u2019t think it\u2019s the third, Mike. I would say it\u2019s -- and you should expect as do you, we compare ourselves to our peers and we try not to focus on a single quarter. We think over longer periods that our performance has been good, if not better in most categories. I do think we look at this as a long term game where as you know we are continuing to drive product development which is creating innovation and topline growth. We think that we\u2019re best positioned in some of the faster growing asset classes, alternatives, ETFs, offshore funds. And so we don\u2019t sit back and ignore investments in those categories. So we\u2019re continuing to drive investment. On the other hand, you referenced the digital enterprise. We also, we\u2019d like to see improved environmental factors that could cause us to return to days of old. ","We\u2019re not expecting that. So we\u2019re continuing to drive efficiency in the core operations. The digital enterprise does have some investment associated with it. It\u2019s designed to make us the low cost producer in some of those commodity activities that we generate. If you were to say what\u2019s the investment that\u2019s going into that, it\u2019s continuing to drive straight through processing, continuing to enhance the private cloud, moving more applications to the private cloud. Some of the new products that we\u2019ve introduced recently, I referenced the portfolio liquidity stress test tool which was built in the cloud fairly rapidly given the need. ","TruCross which is a buy side to buy side foreign exchange platform which we introduced in the last quarter and a half also has those same characteristics. So we\u2019re trying to build for the long term, which means driving those unit costs down, being the lost cost producer in the core base line activities while continuing to invest in those products that continue to differentiate us in what we think are some of the more attractive segments of the investment services business. So as opposed to outperforming in a quarter, we would rather outperform over time and we think we\u2019re positioned to do that.","Operator","Brennan Hawken with UBS, your question please.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. So it appears as though the seasonality in the SPDR ETFs is becoming more pronounced over the last few years. Does this concern you at any way and does it create any kind of constraints on your capabilities whether they be operational or capital markets oriented? And is there anything going on there that might be problematic or that you might want to adjust through your sales processes?","Jay Hooley","Yeah, Brennan. Let me pick that up. I think the broad answer is no. your observation is accurate which is the SPDR S&P 500 is actively used for portfolio positioning. So it spikes, ebbs and flows at quarter end and beginning of the following period. As you expect, S&P highly liquid, so we don\u2019t worry about any operational issues related to the increased volumes going through the SPDR S&P 500 ETF. So really no, we don\u2019t worry about it. I think if you look at, I mentioned the negative flows to SSGA which were dominated by the S&P 500 which, while an attractive productive product, has relatively low revenues associated with it. ","If you look at our currency adjusted performance for SSGA, it was 2% revenues quarter over quarter and 7% year over year. So I think while the big ETFs have high velocity to them, the revenue impact is relatively small. And as I\u2019ve said for several quarters, our focus is more on generating more differentiated, higher revenue producing ETFs. So just in the quarter we introduced seven new ETFs in SSGA. Maybe the most notable was the one with double line which is a total return ETF which has very attractive revenues associated with it and got off to a good start. So no real concern on the high velocity of the S&P 500 ETFs focused on leveraging that ETF business to produce more differentiated products with high revenue per asset mix.","Operator","Your next question is from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello there. Thank you for taking the question. On the comments you made around not seeing the first quarter for first quarter revenues in terms of FX trading as a run rate, is that because you think that volatility moves down a bit of first-quarter level if you look at the indices? Or is it more because some of the dislocation around the Swiss franc and QE kicking in in Europe just created wider spreads on FX trades that aren't going to be sustainable?","Jay Hooley","Yeah. Let me pick that up, Jeff. Mike can comment if he has anything to add. More the latter. I think if you look at volatility, there was a real spike in the first quarter. You mentioned the Swiss National Bank de-peg. It was just a highly volatile quarter that was very conducive to foreign exchange volatility. We don\u2019t see that event obviously repeating itself, but we\u2019re very constructive overall on general volatility going forward and the positive effect it would have on our foreign exchange business. Volatility has gone up for three quarters if you look at the underlying drivers. I keep referencing the divergence of monetary policy. We began the year thinking that UK, US, Australia and the Canadians might begin to tighten. ","The Australians and Canadians have gone the other way, but I\u2019d say the US and the UK are still on the mode of heading towards a policy tightening that monetary divergence is very constructive for foreign exchange volatility. So we think that there were exceptions in the first quarter which won\u2019t repeat, but overall very constructive on foreign exchange volatility going forward. I\u2019d also add that I think if you look at foreign exchange in the first quarter roughly 6%, 7% volume growth, both across platform and not platform business. We\u2019ve seen higher volume growth leading into this quarter which have driven the outperformance. So we will continue to expect we\u2019d see good volume growth and the volatility to persist, just not at the level that we saw in that first quarter. Mike?","Mike Bell","No, that\u2019s perfect, Jay.","Geoffrey Elliott","And just in terms of the overall impact on profitability of the FX revenues, is it fair to assume there is very little expense that goes against them maybe a little bit of comp, but not very much and most of it is just dropping to the bottom line?","Mike Bell","Yes, Jeff. It\u2019s Mike. That\u2019s a fair assessment of the profitability of the high margin FX trading business.","Operator","Your next question is from Adam Beatty with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Adam Beatty","Good morning. A follow-up on asset management, specifically multi-asset class solutions which I think is a relatively small but promising category. It looks like you've had some outflows there lately. Have there been certain products or maybe client mandates driving the outflows? And maybe more importantly, what's your plan for the category in the latest outlook?","Jay Hooley","Let me take that, Adam. The outflows which are categorized in the institutional bucket were almost all from a single target date fund rebalance. So it was just helping a client rebalanced the target date. Very constructive on solutions and solutions has many meanings in the asset management industry I would say. For us, we\u2019ve made a big push on the 401(k) target date fund category where we\u2019ve had several new mandates and we have several promising prospects. But solutions also exist at a broader level where occasionally we\u2019ll compete frequently for institutional mandates where somebody will put out a mandate and ask you to come up with your best ideas to deliver against that set of assets. ","So it comes back a little bit to my comment that Betsy brought up in my discussion with Ron O'Hanley around using asset allocation as one of the key levers in driving our asset management business both at the target date fund, at the intermediary level where increasingly intermediaries are looking for solutions oftentimes derived out of ETFs, as well as at the big institutional bucket. So we think we have a lot of the right asset classes in the right chassis as in ETFs and we also believe we bring a lot of expertise with regard to asset allocation knowledge. So bringing those things together is one of the most important thrusts for SSGA going forward. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning Mike. Good morning Jay. You pointed out, Mike, that you're mixing your assets a little differently because of the SLR and different capital ratios and you've added to your loan book. And I recognized the loan book as a percentage of assets is not very significant for you folks. It's less than your two competitors of course. But can you share with us on the leverage loans where do you think that may go on a go-forward basis? And your total loan growth was about 14% on a year-over-year basis. Should we expect that kind of growth to continue for the rest of the year?","Mike Bell","Sure, Gerard. It\u2019s Mike. Regarding leverage loans specifically, I would expect that that will remain a relatively small part of the overall balance sheet. So at this point we have a total asset there of $2.7 billion. I would expect that we\u2019ll probably have some growth over time relative to that $2.7 billion, but I think it\u2019s unlikely that it would grow that it would get to the point where it was say double that number. I think that\u2019s highly unlikely for the foreseeable future. So again it is a nice complement to the derisking that we\u2019ve had to do as Glenn had asked about derisking moving out of mortgage back and asset backs into treasuries. ","It gives us a little bit of an offset relative to that, but not a huge part of our overall balance sheet. The rest of the loan book primarily relates to loans that we\u2019ve made in support of our client relationships, specifically for example loans to 40 Act funds would be an example. Again under the new regulatory expectations, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have a significant amount of growth in that business simply because those tend to be relatively tight spread loans. And again in an environment where the SLRs are binding constraint, that\u2019s a challenge. So I would not say that we would expect a huge growth in the loan book really for the remainder of 2015.","Operator","Your final question is from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","I just had a quick question on regulatory and compliance costs. You mentioned previously that they were going to be up year on year and first quarter you said that they were up. But if I think about it from the first quarter to the fourth quarter, are they going to go up from the first quarter or is that $300 million run rate in the other expenses a good run rate for that line item?","Mike Bell","Brian, it\u2019s Mike. First, I think what\u2019s most important really of course is the full year outlook and I\u2019ve made the comments around the full year outlook on expense growth relative to fee growth a couple of times. I think that\u2019s the most important thing is to look at the overall expense levels as opposed to just a single line item like other operating expenses. Nevertheless in answer to your direct question, I do expect that we\u2019ll see an increase in other operating expenses over the course of 2015. Again that category tends to be somewhat lumpy, but it\u2019s typically driven by a combination of regulatory compliance spending as well as legal expenses. I do expect that those will be higher than the levels that we saw in Q1 which were seasonally low.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Jay Hooley","Okay, Brandy.

[Operator Instructions] Now I would like to introduce Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at State Street.","Valerie C. Haertel","Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Our fourth quarter earnings materials include a slide presentation. Unless otherwise noted, all the financial information discussed on today's webcast will reflect operating basis results.","Please note that the operating basis results are a non-GAAP presentation and this webcast includes other non-GAAP financial information, reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures, including operating basis results to GAAP basis measures referenced on this webcast, and other related materials can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Mike Bell, our Chief Financial Officer, will refer to the presentation when he provides an overview of our financial results for fourth quarter and full year.","Before Jay and Mike begin the discussion of our financial performance, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those included -- those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street's 2012 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC. We encourage you to review those filings, including the sections on risk factors, concerning any forward-looking statements we make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, January 24, 2014. The Corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.","Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Jay Hooley.","Joseph L. Hooley","Thanks, Valerie, and good morning to all. We are pleased to report our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results, which reflect our focus on our key priorities to deliver value for clients and shareholders. Mike and I will comment on our full year 2013 results, but we'll focus our remarks on the fourth quarter. Then we'll share some initial observations about our expectations for 2014.","By many measures, 2013 was a strong year for State Street. For the full year, we reported operating basis earnings per share of $4.54, which is a 14.9% increase over full year 2012. We stayed focused on our key priorities, growing our core business, controlling our expenses and returning capital to our shareholders. And while we benefited from the strong equity market performance, we executed on our strategic priorities against the headwinds of low interest rates and increasing regulatory requirements. For full year 2013, we grew total operating basis revenue 3.3% to more than $10 billion, despite the pressures from the low interest rate environment.","We grew core servicing and management fees approximately 10% over 2012. We ended 2013 with a record $27.4 trillion in assets under administration and a record $2.35 trillion in assets under management. We delivered approximately $220 million of incremental pretax expense savings in conjunction with our Business Operations and IT Transformation program during 2013, and we achieved positive operating leverage of 171 basis points for full year 2013 compared to full year 2012, calculated on an operating basis. Additionally, we returned approximately $2.5 billion in capital in 2013 to our shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends.","Turning to the fourth quarter 2013 results, we reported operating basis earnings per share of $1.15. Reflected in these results was the continued strength of our core asset servicing and asset management business, partially offset by lower foreign exchange trading revenue.","Now I'd like to share some insight on our new business and our client asset flows during the quarter. Regarding new business, our fourth quarter 2013 new asset servicing wins totaled approximately $392 billion. Of these wins, 30% were from outside the U.S. Also included in these new wins were 41 new alternative asset servicing mandates. Our clients say now we're -- we remain the market leader and continue to see above-average long-term growth potential.","Regarding flows, equity markets rose significantly during the fourth quarter, stemming from continued optimism regarding an economic recovery, especially in light of the Fed's decision to taper its bond purchases and maintain a low rate environment. Our clients experienced increased flows into equities and continued outflows from fixed income funds.","Similar to last quarter, we also continued to see client flows into money market funds. Additionally, we continued to experience high levels of client deposits in the fourth quarter. Trading activities during the quarter were weak as the spread of the global ceiling showdown froze markets in the first part of the quarter and volatility was low throughout the quarter.","Turning to asset management, in the fourth quarter, we experienced net inflows of $5 billion, driven primarily by strong inflows into ETFs, partially offset by institutional outflows from passive equities driven by client rebalancing and rerisking. We also experienced short-term outflows from securities finance pools, offset by inflows into money market funds.","With respect to ETFs, we experienced strong inflows of $18 billion, led by our S&P 500 fund and our sector SPDR funds, partially offset by continued outflows from our Gold ETF. Our new business pipelines in both asset servicing and asset management remain strong and well diversified.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike, who will review our financial performance. Mike?","Michael William Bell","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to mention a couple of nonoperating items included in our GAAP reporting. First, our GAAP results for the quarter included a $71 million tax benefit associated with the completion of a multiyear project related to our deferred tax accounts. This contributed approximately $0.16 per share to our GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter. In addition, the quarter included $45 million of additional accruals for costs associated with previously disclosed litigation and non-U.S. regulatory matters. This reduced GAAP earnings by approximately $0.06 per share in the quarter.","Now I will review our operating basis financial highlights, beginning on Slide 10. From this point on, I'll reference only our non-GAAP operating basis results in my comments.","Overall, our strong full year 2013 results were driven by year-over-year fee revenue growth of 7.4% and good execution on our priority to effectively manage our expenses. In full year 2013, we achieved approximately 15% year-over-year EPS growth despite low short-term interest rates, which negatively impacted both our net interest revenue and our securities finance revenue.","We also generated 171 basis points of positive operating leverage, comparing full year 2013 to full year 2012, and improved our pretax operating margin to 30.1% for full year 2013. Our return on common equity increased to 10.3% for the full year.","Now turning to Slide 11. Fourth quarter 2013 earnings per share of $1.15 decreased from third quarter 2013, primarily as the result of the soft trading environment. The fourth quarter operating results also included several noteworthy items. Net interest revenue included $19 million of revenue associated with a municipal security that was previously impaired. Other expenses included $28 million of securities processing costs, offset by Lehman Brothers-related gains and recoveries.","Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, EPS increased primarily due to higher fee revenue and a reduction in the number of our outstanding shares, partly offset by increased expenses. Fourth quarter total revenue increased compared to the third quarter of 2013, driven by higher core servicing and management fees and higher net interest revenue, partially offset by lower trading revenue.","Total expenses increased in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, occupancy and other expenses. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 8 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately $560 million, resulting in average fully diluted common shares outstanding of approximately 445 million for the quarter. At year end, we had approximately $420 million remaining on our common stock repurchase program, which is effective through March of 2014. We declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.26 per share and also declared a noncumulative quarterly perpetual preferred stock dividend of $0.33 per share during the quarter.","Turning to Slide 12. I'll discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for the fourth quarter of 2013, focusing on the notable variances. Fourth quarter servicing fees increased approximately 2% from the third quarter and 7% from the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to stronger global equity markets and net new business.","Fourth quarter management fees increased approximately 5% from the third quarter and 12% from the fourth quarter of 2012, respectively. The increase in both periods primarily reflects stronger global equity markets. Fourth quarter management fees were negatively impacted by $13 million of money market fee waivers compared to $12 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. For the full year 2013, money market fee waivers were $40 million.","Performance fees in the fourth quarter of 2013 were approximately $5 million, up from $4 million in the third quarter and down from $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Total trading services revenue decreased 11% compared to the third quarter, primarily due to lower foreign exchange trading revenue from lower market volatility. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, total trading services revenue decreased 6%, primarily due to lower fees associated with the SPDR Gold ETF. Securities finance revenue increased approximately 3% from both the third quarter of 2013 and the fourth quarter of 2012. Average securities on loan were relatively unchanged sequentially at $315 billion.","Processing fees and other revenue increased approximately 3% from the third quarter of 2013, primarily due to an increase in revenue associated with tax-advantaged investments. The decrease from the prior year quarter is primarily due to specifically noted gains recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Operating basis net interest revenue of $596 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 increased from $553 million in the third quarter of 2013, due in part to $19 million in revenue associated with a previously impaired municipal security. In addition, higher interest-earning assets and lower mortgage prepayments contributed to the sequential increase in net interest revenue. Excluding the $19 million in net interest revenue associated with a municipal security, our operating basis net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2013 was 125 basis points.","Now let's turn to operating basis expenses on Slide 13. Our total expenses for the fourth quarter of 2013 increased from the third quarter, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, occupancy and other expenses. Our fourth quarter 2013 compensation and employee benefits expenses increased 3.4% from the third quarter, primarily due to lower benefit costs resulting from planned changes in the third quarter, as well as increased costs in the fourth quarter to support new business.","Our Business Operations and IT Transformation program continues to be on track. For full year 2013, we achieved approximately $220 million in additional pretax expense savings, resulting in approximately $420 million of incremental pretax expense savings since the inception of the program. Our nonrecurring expenses related to our Business Operations and IT Transformation program were approximately $26 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. Occupancy expenses of $124 million in the fourth quarter increased relative to the third quarter of 2013, primarily due to the effect of a one-time $8 million charge in this quarter associated with a sublease renegotiation.","Other expenses increased to $292 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, largely due to higher securities processing costs, professional services fees and sales promotion costs. The fourth quarter also included $28 million of Lehman Brothers-related gains and recoveries compared to $30 million in the third quarter of 2013. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, other expenses increased, primarily due to higher securities processing costs.","Now I will provide you some details on our balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 14, our overall philosophy to managing our investment portfolio has not changed. We maintain a high credit quality profile with 89% AAA- or AA-rated securities, and 44% of our security is fixed rate and 56% floating rate. Our interest rate risk position was in line with our position at the end of the third quarter of 2013, and the duration of the portfolio remains relatively unchanged at approximately 1.9 years. Additionally, the unrealized mark-to-market loss increased during the quarter to $213 million, primarily due to a rise in market interest rates.","We monitor and manage our interest rate risk position using a variety of risk measures, including EVE, primarily to determine the potential impact of a rise in rates on both the mark-to-market and on our net interest revenue. During the fourth quarter, these risk metrics remained within our risk appetite.","Maintaining a strong capital position is very important to us. Particularly in this evolving and complex regulatory environment, we continue to identify opportunities to optimize the capital efficiency of our balance sheet. As we reported last quarter, we've begun to invest in senior secured bank loans, targeting BB- and B-rated issuers, all subject to our credit underwriting standards. As of year-end 2013, this loan book exposure was $931 million.","In accordance with GAAP, we recorded a provision for loan losses of approximately $6 million in the fourth quarter related to the aggregate senior secured bank loan portfolio. This calculation is based upon market credit loss factors for loans with similar characteristics and does not reflect an identified loss event for any particular loan in our portfolio.","Now let's turn to the next slide to review our capital position. As you can see, we maintained a strong capital position, and that strength has allowed us to deliver on our key priority of returning value to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. As of year-end 2013, our estimated pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 10.1% under the standardized approach and 11.8% under the advanced approach. We estimate that our pro forma Basel III supplementary leverage ratios under the U.S. proposed rules are approximately 5.2% at the holding company and approximately 5.0% at the bank as of December 31, 2013. The slight decrease in the holding company ratio from the prior quarter is primarily due to the influx of client cash deposits on our balance sheet at year-end 2013.","Recently, the Basel Committee released its final rules on the supplementary leverage ratio. While there were several modifications made to the rule that, if adopted by the U.S. regulator, would be helpful to us, we are disappointed that the committee did not exclude central bank deposits from the denominator. And we will continue to work with the U.S. regulators to seek exclusion when the U.S. rules are finalized. The target effective date is January 1 of 2018.","Assuming the rules go into effect as proposed, we believe that we have a number of levers that would enable us to comply with these requirements in advance of the 2018 effective date. The Basel Committee also updated their thinking on the net stable funding ratio. While there's still more work to be done, the recognition of some liquidity value in operational deposits is helpful to us. Again, we believe that by the targeted effective date of January 1, 2018, we will have taken appropriate actions to be in compliance with the rules.","In October, the U.S. banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking or proposed rule intended to implement the Basel Committee's liquidity coverage ratio or LCR. While the U.S. proposed rule is generally consistent with the Basel Committee's LCR, it includes certain more stringent requirements, including an accelerated implementation timeline and modifications to the definition of high-quality liquid assets and expected outflow assumptions. The proposed rule remains subject to interpretation, regulatory guidance and public comment until January 31 of 2014, before the issuance of a final rule.","In addition, in December, 5 federal agencies issued final rules developed jointly to implement Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. We continue to analyze the proposed rules and their potential impact on us, and intend to develop and implement any changes to ensure compliance. In the meantime, we remain focused on executing our capital plan that we submitted in conjunction with the 2013 CCAR, which includes our authorization to purchase up to $2.1 billion of our common stock through March 31 of 2014, of which approximately $420 million remained available as of year-end 2013.","So to summarize our results, our strong performance for the full year 2013 was driven by positive core servicing and management fee revenue, as well as our continued control over expenses. We are proud of achieving 171 basis points of positive operating leverage for full year 2013 compared to full year 2012 and increasing our pretax operating margin to 30.1%.","Now let's turn to our 2014 outlook on Slide 17, beginning with revenue. For 2014, we expect total revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 5% compared to 2013. This growth rate is predicated on a number of important assumptions. First, we plan to continue to execute on our top priorities: driving core revenue growth, investing in new growth opportunities, controlling expenses and managing our strong capital position. Second, we assume a modest increase in market interest rates later in 2014. As we've discussed previously, until short-term interest rates begin to rise, we expect our net interest revenue to continue to be under pressure.","For planning purposes, we assume equity markets, defined as the S&P 500 NEV [ph], will remain close to year-end 2013 levels for the full year 2014. In addition, we expect that the market environment will improve and benefit both our securities finance and trading revenues. We continue to target positive operating leverage on a full year basis. Our ability to achieve this goal is highly dependent upon our continued diligence in controlling expenses across the company. We continue to expect to achieve an incremental $130 million in pretax expense savings in 2014 from our Business Operations and IT Transformation Program and to continue to invest in initiatives to drive revenue growth from the expansion of new products and services for clients in key sectors and geographies. Additionally, we expect some upward pressure on regulatory compliance costs.","Now I'd also like to remind you that, as in prior years, the first quarter 2014 compensation and employee benefits expense will be higher due to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees, as well as for payroll taxes. We expect the incremental amount attributed to equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter of 2014 to be approximately $150 million.","In 2014, we expect to remain focused on optimizing our strong capital position and returning capital to our shareholders. We plan to complete our current 2013 common stock repurchase plan, effective through March 31 of 2014. In addition, we submitted our 2014 CCAR plan to the Federal Reserve, which included a capital distribution program of dividends and common stock purchases that we believe is consistent with our strong capital position and earnings capacity. The amount in form of capital distribution in our plan is contingent upon the Federal Reserve not objecting to our request, and we expect to receive the results of their review in mid-March.","We continue to believe that our common stock repurchase program, combined with dividends, is the best way to return value to shareholders. And return of capital remains a top priority for us. Now I'll turn the call back to Jay.","Joseph L. Hooley","Thanks, Mike. Let me close our call by briefly reiterating our continued focus on creating value for our clients and shareholders by growing revenue, diligently controlling expenses and returning capital to our shareholders through common stock purchases and dividends.","Stephanie, Mike and I are now available to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Mike, just a point of clarification in the outlook on the modest increase in market interest rates. Are we talking specifically short rates later in 2014? And then just curious, does that even impact NII in '14, or is there a lag and it really starts impacting in '15?","Michael William Bell","Sure, Glenn. The short answer is, we do expect by the end of 2014 an increase in market interest rates, both at the short term as well as at the intermediate term. And we would expect some modest benefit from that in net interest revenue and, importantly, as well, in the securities finance revenue, that it would help immensely to see some uptick, for example, in the 90-day rates for the securities lending business. And what we intend to do, Glenn, is at the Investor Day, where we have time to provide some greater context, to give you some of the scenarios that we've looked at. So I think we can answer that question pretty thoroughly for you here on February 27.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. On a related note, ECB had cut. I went back and looked, and I -- the last public comment I saw was 25 basis points, equaled something like $40 million in annual revenues. I'm just curious if that relationship holds or -- and how you're thinking about ECB as they talk about the potential for going negative on deposit rates. Do you have to park the money in the same locale? Can you park your money elsewhere?","Michael William Bell","Okay. Yes, ballpark, Glenn, we still think that, that sensitivity of the $40 million is rational. Again, let us give you a more thorough answer to some alternatives when we see you in February.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Last one, just as a reminder for myself. There's a pretty big gap between or spread between your standardized and advanced Basel III ratios. So I'm curious, a, what produces the bulk of that large gap? And b, does it impact how you go about the CCAR process?","Michael William Bell","Sure. So Glenn, first, you're absolutely right. At the moment, we have a 170-basis-point spread between the advanced approach and the standardized approach for the Basel III risk-weighted asset calculations. As we've talked about last quarter, there are 2 main drivers of that. First, the standardized approach uses standardized risk factors and haircuts, where the advanced model uses advanced model-driven loss estimates.","And the standardized risk factors and haircuts are more punitive in 2 areas. First, certain off-balance-sheet items, for example around the securities finance business, is treated more punitively under the standardized approach. And the other area that's more punitively treated is the high-quality assets. And our balance sheet is chock-full of high-quality assets. So as a result, the -- under the current environment with our current balance sheet, the standardized approach is the more punitive one of the 2.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Do you anticipate a changing behavior? Because it would seem counterstates or counterintuitive to change your quality metrics based on that. Or just it is what it is, and hopefully, the metrics will adapt to the quality of the balance sheet? In other words, all I'm looking to find out is, does it change how you go about your capital return thought process?","Michael William Bell","Sure. So Glenn, we do need to meet the more onerous of the 2 requirements under the CCAR stressed scenario. So as we are working to sort out how to optimize our balance sheet mix going forward, that is part of our calculations, that is part of our thinking around balance sheet strategy for the future. I would remind you that the standardized ratio does not kick in until 1\/1\/2015. So for 2014, the binding constraint is the advanced approach.","But again, CCAR is about the long term as much as it is about the short term. So qualitatively, as we go through CCAR, we need to be cognizant of the supplementary leverage ratio that may be coming down the line, as well as the more onerous of the standardized and advanced approach. And that's why the work that we're doing to optimize our balance sheet under the new rules is something that's a pretty complex undertaking. But we are confident we're going to be in compliance, and as we draw conclusions on that, we'll certainly plan to communicate that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Mike, I just wanted to ask you about the outlook for revenues you were very clear on and positive operating leverage. You've got the pretax margin at 30% this year, and last year, you did 170 basis points of operating leverage. So I was just wondering if you can help us put in context what type of magnitude of improvement can we see on both the pretax margin direction and if you can maintain or even increase that operating leverage gap.","Michael William Bell","Sure, Ken. First, I would prefer to wait until the Investor Day, where we have time to give you some additional context. For example, we do plan, as I mentioned to Glenn, we do plan to share some of the modeling we've done on various interest rate scenarios, and as well as talk about work that we're doing in our core businesses to drive revenue growth, but also in some of the new growth opportunities that we see out there. And then we'll also talk about some of the areas where we're investing.","So I think, Ken, I'd prefer, rather than trying to give it to you in a 30-second answer on a crowded conference call, I'd rather wait and give it to you at the Investor Day. But I think stepping back, to me, what's most important is that, even in a relatively low growth environment where we would expect revenue growth to only be 3% to 5% compared to our long-term targets, which are quite a bit higher than that, we still believe we'll be positioned to achieve positive operating leverage, perhaps not as much as 2013, but again, another step forward on the operating leverage. And therefore, we would expect, again, good progress as an enterprise through our strategic goal of being a low-cost provider in this business.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my second question relates to just -- I want to understand this, the increase in the FTE adjustment, which obviously gets backed out from a GAAP perspective. But is -- could you just walk us through the elevated tax adjustment, tax investments? How much is that carrying now in that processing other and if this is the new run rate for that, because I don't think people would've expected that to be as much of a backout this quarter?","Michael William Bell","Sure. Ken, first of all, as we've previously disclosed, we have been steadily looking for opportunities to make tax-advantaged investments. And we've been doing that pretty consistently over the last couple of years, and that's been beneficial in terms of our effective tax rate. On the specific tax-equivalent adjustment for Q4, let me -- why don't we take that one offline. I think we were going to talk to you a little bit later today. It's just not a -- it's not a simple calculation, so I prefer to do that, again, not in a crowded conference call, if you will.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my last question then, Mike, just to get more granular then on the quarter itself, then is -- I mean, a lot of people are asking you about the elevated other expenses. And could you just help us reestablish a base for what that line should look like going forward? Because I think that's, again, that's another key question, I think, in terms of this stock's reaction today.","Michael William Bell","Sure, absolutely, Ken. First, on the other expenses, as we've talked about previously, remember, this stuff can bounce around quarter-to-quarter because some of the costs in this category are pretty lumpy. And a good example of that is the securities processing costs. So the securities processing costs in the quarter were $28 million. We don't think $28 million in a quarter is reflective of our outlook going forward, but it's a good reminder that the number does bounce around quarter-to-quarter.","Now I'd point out, recently, in the recent past, we've been doing a good job in this area, and we would expect that to normalize in 2014. But that would be an example, Ken, of why I don't think the $292 million in total for the other category is a good run rate going forward.","And then just to talk about a couple of the other larger pieces. We had sales promotional costs of $6 million this quarter. That mainly is part of our year-end process to support our investment management business. So that was planned. But again, that -- we view that as a Q4 item. We would expect that to normalize back out in Q1. So again, I would reduce for that.","And I'd say the big wildcard really are the higher legal and regulatory compliance costs, and that reflects a combination of this regulatory environment that we are operating in, where we have had to spend more money on a variety of things that, in an ideal world, we wouldn't. But we do live in this world, and we've had to spend some more money in that area, in particular, more money on professional services, which increased for the quarter.","And then the legal costs, which primarily relate to prior year problems, but there are areas where we do need to spend money to support our position. So at this point, I'd -- the number has been bouncing around enough and there's enough uncertainty around our regulatory compliance costs, Ken, that I'd prefer not to give you a new range or something like that for 2014. But I do think, at our Investor Day, we can give you some additional color on how we're thinking about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you can comment on the kind of continued disconnect between your servicing fees and assets under custody and administration. And I think this is the phenomenon that we've seen for almost 2 years now. And even this year, when your average assets are up 12, fees are up 9. Last year they were up 5, fees were flat. So can you help us flush out, I guess, this dynamic and what needs to happen to bridge that gap going forward?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, let me start that, Alex, and Mike will it pick up. First off, I look at market and service fee correlations, and if you look at, it's hard to examine much in a quarter. But if you look year-over-year, service fees are up 9%. Equity markets were up big, fixed income markets were not. So if you piece that apart a little bit, a couple of factors. One is the mix, the question of, when you look at the service, the global services business, I think, by our calculation, less than half of the revenues are tied directly to assets. So this -- the other half are tied to other fee levels, other fees that are unassociated with assets.","The -- I guess the other thing I would say, which is -- makes the question even murkier is, if you look at the baseline, the baseline of service fees in any given period or period-over-period change is influenced by investor flows. And given that we have, proportionately, as a trust bank, higher exposure to asset managers, flows make a big difference.","And if you look during the course of 2013, you have some positives. So obviously, equity markets and equity flows were very positive. But fixed income flows were pretty negative. In the second half of the year, they outstripped positive equity flows. And so you've got that factor, and then you've also got the factor of the emerging markets pullback, and the fourth quarter was also a little bit of a headwind. So I'm not sure that explains, but at least it gives you some of the ingredients that determine service fees. Mike, do you want to pick up anything else?","Michael William Bell","Sure, Alex, this is Mike. Only a couple of things I would add. First, I'll just reinforce Jay's point that it is important to note that only a little -- in fact, a little less than half of the service fee revenue line is directly driven by the basis points on assets. So that really is an important point. You would expect, in a market -- we would expect, in a market where markets are rising, that the service fees would trail the increasing assets because of that phenomenon.","And then I just have rounded out. Transaction fees are between 10% and 15% of that particular number, and transactions were up just a blip relative to Q3 but were down relative to Q2. So again, transactions will tend to move, in general, with the relative bullishness or really relative to that kind of risk on, risk off in the market. And that's been something that's been a headwind for the -- that line item in the third quarter and fourth quarter.","And then lastly, out-of-pocket expense recoveries also impact that line item. So again, just to give a specific example. We had lower out-of-pocket expense recoveries that -- of $6 million that's essentially the same $6 million of the drop in the information systems line item on the expense side. So again, there are going to be some things that don't matter from a P&L standpoint but can bounce around in the servicing fees line item, in particular.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. So I mean, you guys didn't mention pricing in any of this, so it's fair to assume that you haven't seen any change in the way certain businesses are priced relative to what they have been or what kind of amount that you are winning?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I would say, directionally, Alex, no real change. In certain markets and certain product lines, it's highly competitive. It's less so on others. We continue to try to send signals to the market by backing away from deals that become so thinly priced in an attempt to try to establish more reasonable pricing. But that's a journey more than an event, but no marked change in pricing over the course of the last quarter.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then, Mike, I was hoping maybe you could just flesh out a little bit more the net interest income guidance for yours for next year. Just a couple of nuances around the balance sheet size. I'm not sure how much you expect to leave in the first quarter. So what do you guys think -- are you guys thinking as far as the average size of the balance sheet goes for 2014?","Michael William Bell","Sure, Alex, well, first of all, again, we'll give more color, more detail on this at the Investor Day. But if I focus just on Q1 for a second, we did see an increase in the excess deposits on our balance sheet of approximately $6 billion, Q4 relative to Q3. So the excess deposits we estimate in Q4 was approximately $25 billion. I would expect that, that number will decline in Q1 and decline even further by the end of 2014 if, in fact, short-term rates begin to rise as we anticipate that they will.","So I think it's important to factor that into the thinking. In terms of the core deposits, we do expect that over any longer period of time, we expect that there'll be growth in our core operational deposits, essentially commensurate with our overall fee revenue growth and our overall client base. Again, I would view that as sort of a small single digits over the course of the year. So therefore, I would expect a drop in the excess deposits on average to reduce our average assets for full year 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a quick question, follow-up on Glenn's question about the 2014 outlook. I think it was my understanding, I think, generally, people see that your -- or feel that your balance sheet is short-term liability sensitive. In the past, you said that your net interest margin could actually compress until the rates stop going up. So has there been any change in your thinking about how rates affect your balance sheet and NII, at least in the short term?","Michael William Bell","Well, Luke, it's Mike. Obviously, I'm still relatively new here, so I can't connect all the dots from prior discussions. But here is how we're thinking about it. We're thinking about it that a rise in short-term interest rates in particular, the 30-day and the 90-day rates in particular, would be particularly helpful to us. Because remember, over half of our balance sheet is comprised of floating-rate securities. And therefore, as short-term rates rise, we get an automatic pickup in NIR from those securities.","On the liability side, we would expect that liability rates would ultimately increase with short-term interest rates. But in the near term, they would likely increase at a slower pace than what we would pick up on the yield side. So if you take the combination of the benefit I just described on NIR, combined with the benefit on the securities lending business, that would be a much better environment for us to operate in if short-term rates, in particular, would rise.","Now I think the question that you're asking around the long-term interest rates may tie back to our mortgage-backed securities in the portfolio. We were in a phenomenon where there was some risk of those assets extending and then that having a collateral impact on the need to reduce the duration of our portfolio. I think if there's good news is that, that issue, for the most part, is behind us. There's not a lot more extension left in that particular book. So I wouldn't expect the second-order impact of that phenomenon to hurt us in 2014.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then a back-of-envelope analysis would suggest that your organic growth in the custody business has been averaging somewhere around 1.5% over the last 4 years. I was hoping whether you would affirm or deny it, if that seems like a reasonable guesstimate. And then, I think given the strength of the new business wins you announced each quarter, it does seem to suggest that you're losing some mandates, and so perhaps you could kind of put that estimate in the context of how you're feeling about your market share gains or losses?","And then along with that, have you given any more thought to increasing disclosure around components of organic growth? My sense is that the investment community really would like to see you and your peers move in that direction, but I think it's going to take one of you to set the disclosure bar higher for everybody. So wondering if that's going to be you.","Joseph L. Hooley","Let me jump in there, Luke. Let me first go at the question of clients win -- client wins and losses and market share gains and losses. I think we don't win everything we compete for. There's some things that we really go after and we don't win, but I would say our win-loss rate for those things that we think are attractive where we have a differentiated position, therefore we can get decent pricing, is quite good.","I point to segments like the alternative segment, which I frequently bring up. I think we have a differentiated value proposition there. We tend to compete very effectively. We don't win them all, but we do pretty well. I'd say the same thing for very involved and integrated complex asset manager sales, particularly if there is a middle office to it.","Again, the number of competitors shrink and we fare pretty well there. You could say the same for some markets overseas. I would say, as a general theme, we compete more effectively in the asset manager segment versus the asset owner segment, so that's funds versus pensions as a theme, which leads you to things like offshore markets, Luxembourg, Dublin, very competitive there. Market share data is not easy to come by. There are some -- probably the deepest markets in the world for custodians would be markets like the U.S. mutual fund market. I think that's probably a market that has the clearest data. The ICI puts out information.","And I would say that if you look at that as we look at that, we are gaining market share in that -- what we think is a key segment. With regard to just picking another one of your questions, the organic growth, as Mike has come on board, we've spent time with several of you in groups and individually, and we are really thinking about ways where we can express more clearly the issue of what drives organic growth and then incremental new business. And we don't yet have a conclusion on that. But I understand the point, both the interest, the keen interest in understanding the drivers of that, and also the point about somebody needs to lead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Levin with Citigroup.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So we've seen some turmoil in the emerging markets in terms of equity markets and also in terms of the FX markets. How do we think about how that sort of turmoil affects your business, both the positives and the negatives?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, so let me start that one, Josh. The -- if you look at the core global services business, the type of asset that we're servicing is affected by the revenues or affected by the type of asset we're servicing. So in a simple example, domestic equity versus an emerging market, equity or bond is going to carry a lot more revenue per unit of asset. So that's the first thing. So as there's a retreat from emerging markets, which we saw in the fourth quarter, as well as we saw a little bit more recently over the last couple of days in the core global services business, that's a headwind. So movement into emerging markets would be a big positive given the incremental fees that we get associated with servicing emerging markets-type instruments.","On the foreign exchange side, it cuts back a little bit the other way. Good market movement in and out of emerging markets and volatility would be a positive thing. Although, even though we've seen retreat from emerging markets, volatility remained pretty low throughout the fourth quarter, which you might say is a little unusual.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. My second question is about M&A. So there is a lot of speculation that M&A is going to pick up in the United States this year. If we do see more deals, a higher number of deals, a greater dollar value of deals, how should we think about that affecting your business?","Joseph L. Hooley","I think the -- there is a lot of discussion, and actually, there's been some action probably in the merger and acquisition activity. I don't think you've seen much in financial markets. And I guess the way we would like at it is, break it down a little bit. In the core asset servicing business, it would have to be very special. And I can't imagine -- one, I can't imagine anything significant because I think it would get considerable regulatory scrutiny. And if it was a small add-on to us, it would have to be very attractively priced for us to be interested in it. I've said before that in the core custody business, I don't feel like we have any big gaps in our offering.","Geographically, we're pretty well placed from a standpoint of asset classes with the moves we made into alternatives, pretty well placed. So I don't feel like there's a gap that we need to fill. And so therefore, any acquisition would be largely acquisition of clients. And again, size -- large-sized deals would be off the table, in my opinion, and smaller-sized deals would have to be extraordinarily attractive from a financial standpoint. I think probably off your question but a little bit on the small end of acquisitions, small software products or capabilities that would round out some products in our asset management business or in our emerging risk and analytics business, that might be interesting. But I'd say the big stuff for us is very unlikely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I just want to know if we're expecting too much too soon from the Business Op and IT program, if we should collectively stretch out our expectations. I guess fourth quarter was a pause in the efficiency progress. Linked quarter, you're 70% done with the Business Op and IT program for the expense savings. You said you expect positive operating leverage this year, but a little bit less, and that's partly predicated on higher short-term rates this year. But maybe with the expense savings mostly done, should we think about the additional benefits to be less visible in your earnings?","And I'll refer to a -- there's a new book out this week by your neighbors, some MIT professors, called The Second Machine Age, and it looked at 600 firms and they showed that it takes 5 to 7 years before you really get the full benefits of productivity. So are -- while the best expense savings, I think, are behind you based on your reported numbers, should we be looking out 2, 3, 4 years from now?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, let me start that one, Mike, and our Mike can jump in. The -- we're entering the next-to-final year of our publicized IT and Ops transformation. We've got 130 million that we've got to achieve this year, and then there is a stub for 2015. You know because I've taken you through this before that the -- what we've done is structurally changed the cost of delivering core services here. We've centralized and standardized and leveraged offshore locations highly successfully, and now we're in that last leg of rebuilding the systems to make those processes even more efficient. And what you'll see this year and next year is the wrap-up of that.","What inspired me along the way was you mentioned the MIT professors, the book that McAfee and his partner wrote on the Race Against the Machine, and this -- maybe this is Phase 2 of that book that you're referencing. But what you take away from that is that the power of technology in these transaction processing businesses is in the early innings. So I look at what we've done, and we've restructured our operations, we are applying technology, but as we look out into the future, I think it only gets more interesting, frankly, as we look at -- now that we've standardized these things, how much labor we can take out by displacing it with technology.","And one of the great examples that, that book referenced, which is -- was insightful to me is the driverless car from Google and what technology can accomplish today. And I don't think, generally, the financial markets, and you might even say the financial transaction processing businesses in the financial markets, have anywhere near matured out that opportunity.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","So as a follow-up, and I don't want to put words in your mouth, it sounds as though you're as confident as ever about the future, but what I think I'm hearing is a little bit less confidence about this year in front of us. And if there's one item that changed from a few years ago, when you started on this initiative, has it more than any other factor simply been the regulatory cost? Is that -- has that been the unexpected negative surprise?","Joseph L. Hooley","I would say that's pretty fair, Mike. I think the -- unfortunately, I would have thought, 2 years ago, we would be cresting the hill and we would be declining our investment in these kinds of things. But it's not happening that way. I mean, it -- just a simple example that maybe highlights some of my frustration and some of the cost is, you look at the Volcker rule, which for a firm like State Street has a -- not a significant impact, yet the systems that we are building to report on, the trading that we're doing to prove that it's not proprietary, is just mind blowing. So I think you're right that probably one of the biggest surprises -- I guess the other thing that I would say, though, is we are also trying to walk a fine line between becoming more efficient and continuing to invest.","And I think that -- so for the long term -- for the short term, we are trying to deliver good value to the shareholders, but we're also continuing to invest. And you've heard me say before that this IT and Ops transformation, probably the most exciting future aspect of it is laying in new technology which will allow us to be more agile with regard to introducing new products, both -- particularly in the data space. So -- but you're right, just to go back to your point about regulatory, and generally, compliance cost has been the biggest surprise.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to kind of go back to the rate sensitivity discussion. And Mike, you had mentioned that, kind of running your simulations, that you saw that short-term asset yields would go up faster than the short-term liability costs. When you report your economic value of equity, I think the brackets mean that, that's negative, which means that a rising interest rate environment, I think, would be negative to equity. I just want to make sure that I was reading the brackets right.","Michael William Bell","Yes, Marty, it's Mike. You are reading the brackets right. Now importantly, that relates to the mark-to-market on the balance sheet. So again, a little bit different phenomenon than what kind of impact would that have on our net interest margin and net interest revenue in 2014.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. So I just wanted to make sure, there really is a disconnect between what you're looking at there, and you're saying the major difference is just the mark-to-market on the investment portfolio?","Michael William Bell","Yes. Importantly, Marty, the EVE is the entire balance sheet. So again, it's a little bit apples and oranges. But again, there's sort of 2 different phenomenon going on here. The rise -- I'll repeat, the rise in the short-term interest rates would be particularly helpful to our net interest margin and net interest revenue for 2014. And we believe that the impact on the mark would be manageable over the period.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And I think also, what's probably building into your EVE looking so negative is the duration assumption that you're probably applying to your deposits and DDAs and transaction accounts. I mean, they have a lot longer life, so.","Michael William Bell","Marty, that's absolutely right, and that is one of the issues around EVE, which is why we really look at a variety of different risk metrics, not just the EVE, to measure our overall profile.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I just wanted to reconcile the comment you made earlier to that number. That helps a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ashley N. Serrao - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I just wanted to, first, just dig into the expenses this quarter. I guess I was surprised, if I look at info systems and communications, I was surprised by the tick-down there. And then if I look at salaries and benefits and then look over the past 3 quarters, you've managed to show year-over-year declines, and this is the first quarter where it actually went up. So just wondering whether you could provide some additional color there.","Michael William Bell","Sure, it's Mike. I'll start. The -- on the information systems line item, importantly, that did include a decline of $6 million in out-of-pocket expenses, which is really -- means that we spend that money on behalf of our client and then get that money back in service fees. So there was a $6 million downdraft in both servicing fees and the information systems costs related to that phenomenon. So I think it's a little bit of a one-off, and I wouldn't put a lot of weight into those.","More importantly, on your question on the comp and benefits, first of all, the Q3 comp and benefits included a one-time benefit of $12 million from a change we made in one of our employee benefit programs. So we had talked about that on the Q3 call being one-time and that you ought to naturally think that, that $12 million, it will go back up $12 million, all things equal in Q4, and that has materialized the way we expected. The bulk of the remainder, though, in the comp and benefits is to support our new business. We are obviously pleased with our overall new business results for full year 2013 and even accounts that will be generating revenue early in 2014.","And we did have an increase in the new business support costs. This would include things like the on-boarding contractors that we use. It would include the growth in the alternative investment business that Jay referenced earlier. It would include year-end sales comp. So the -- that is related to new business. And as we look to first quarter of 2014, we do expect that to normalize, other than, of course, the $150 million one-time impact we will have in first quarter from the annual incentive comp. Put that aside, we expect the comp and benefits to normalize again in Q1 as we work through that on-boarding.","Ashley N. Serrao - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, Mike, I appreciate that you'll be providing more details on your 2014 guidance on your Analyst Day. But I just want to clarify what -- the bottom end of your 3% to 5% revenue growth, does that assume a rise in interest rates?","Michael William Bell","Boy, that's a difficult question to answer in a vacuum. The 3% bottom of the range does look at a more pessimistic market environment than our base-case scenario. So I would say that it wasn't quite as precise as what you're -- as the question you're asking, but I think it's fair to say that if we did not see a change in interest rates, then we'd be more likely to be closer to the 3%. But again, there are a lot of moving parts there, and I think we can give you a more thorough answer when we take the time at the Investor Day to walk through that.","Ashley N. Serrao - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, just then finally, alternative services has been a great business for you guys and you've had a strong presence there. Like how are you thinking about the revenue opportunity from here? What can you do organically into '14 and '15?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I think -- so I think -- let me take that, Ashley. The -- we think that we compete effectively and we do well in the hedge fund segment of alternatives. By our estimate, 70% of the hedge funds have outsourced the kind of work that we do. So there's potentially an additional market share gain. There's potentially more hedge funds, which we'll outsource. And I think that's -- maybe it\u2019s not a certainty, but it's highly likely given the pressures that hedge funds are under to be more transparent among -- to their customers.","But I guess the other thing -- the other element of alternatives, which is kind of exciting, is we have also moved into the private equity and real estate subsegments of alternatives. And by our estimate and industry estimates, only 30% of those firms have outsourced. So we would expect proportionately greater growth in those nonhedged alternative segments, and we feel well positioned.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I had a follow-up on the other side of the revenue guidance, the 3% to 5% range that you talked about. So the 3% is a more negative outlook than your base case for interest rates. But can you give us some color around what is the assumptions behind the upper -- the boundaries on the upper end of the 5%?","Michael William Bell","Yes, Betsy, it's Mike. Again, I'd prefer to go into that level of detail at the Investor Day. But broadly speaking, we would expect a -- to -- at the 5% scenario, broadly speaking, we would expect a rise in both short-term as well as intermediate-term interest rates, certainly beginning July 1. And in that kind of environment, it's likely to be a more positive global economy. So in that kind of environment, with a more positive global economy and higher 30-day and 90-day interest rates, we would expect the sec lending business to be stronger, we would expect our trading revenue to be stronger and we would expect that to have -- mean good things for top line as well as bottom line. But let me leave it at that and save the additional detail here for Investor Day.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great, because the kind of implication is that the fee line is a plus 4 grower, and that seems a little bit modest compared to what you've done historically. So that would be great to flush out at Investor Day. And then just separately, on the expense line, you've discussed regulatory a couple of times, and I know throughout the conference calls of the prior year you've indicated where regulatory expenses has crept up. So we've had rising regulatory costs throughout the year.","I guess what I'm wondering is, as we look at the year-on-year, because you called out the year-on-year would have a higher reg cost, is it a run rate from 4Q? In other words, is the higher year-on-year function effect that regulatory costs increased throughout the year? Or is it -- are you also saying that there's an increase in reg costs from your 4Q run rate?","Michael William Bell","Yes, Betsy, I would think about it as a full year to full year as opposed to a full year to the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter, in our expectation, was relatively high in a number of these legal and regulatory compliance areas. So I would think about it more year-on-year as opposed to year versus Q4.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, and excluding legal, just the regulatory cost itself, what you're basically saying is your run rate in 4Q is a decent run rate for the full year?","Michael William Bell","Yes, I don't think I'd be quite that precise. But I think that our comments around the upward pressure on regulatory compliance costs, if you exclude legal, really related to full year '14 versus full year '13. And one of the reasons, Betsy, just in full disclosure here, it's a difficult question to answer, is that, keep in mind, we've got spending across the enterprise that's driven by these demands. So it's not like it's a discrete budget that captures all the dollars.","I mean, many of us just around this table are spending a lot more time on regulatory compliance issues than we have in the past. So it -- I mean, it impacts -- it really pervades a number of different budgets. It pervades systems costs relating to the Volcker reporting that Jay referenced earlier. It increases the staff that we need in the compliance area in ERM. It increases the professional services expenses. So it's not a -- it's not that it's a -- there's not sort of a readily easy single number to point to, which is why I'm -- again, I'd just urge you to focus more on the year-over-year trend.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, no, I get that. I just wanted to make sure. Your message is essentially, look, those expenses have been rising throughout the year for things we all know about. You're not -- that's what you're making the statement on, not necessarily, \"Hey, there is more coming that we're anticipating from 4Q annually.\" So that answers the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. The first thing is that I'm just kind of curious, I mean, the -- and this also occurred in 2013, but the normal seasonal bump in Q1 comp, the -- year-over-year, it's 27% increase, was pretty big of an increase this year. Is this -- is that simply just related to higher expected comp accruals as the business grows? I mean, it's pretty -- seems like a pretty outsized kind of jump.","Michael William Bell","Sure, Rob, it's Mike. In terms of relative to the Q1 bump that we saw in 2013, there are a couple of different things going on. First of all, it does reflect the fact that full year 2013 was a better result for the enterprise than full year '12. So that is reflected in what we expect the management compensation to be here in the first quarter, so that's a piece of it. Second, we have had some changes in the demographics. So the main impact that we get, of course, is the impact of those that are age 55 and have had 5 years of credited service. Again, that demographic has contributed to the increase.","And then importantly, we have an approximately $10 million increase year-over-year related to some new regulations, new compensation regulations in Europe. So there was some compensation for certain individuals that had to be adjusted. And as a result, that drives that number up $10 million versus first quarter of 2013.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And the -- maybe my next question is going back to trying to think about the asset servicing line and the business mix, and maybe this is something you intend to address at the Investor Day. But if I look at the assets under custody and administration, and I'm actually looking at Page 12 on the trends report, where you have the breakdown by funds, collective funds, I'm assuming the collective funds is where most of the alternative products sit. But is that -- should we think of that as a reasonable representation of those segments' contribution to the fee revenue line, or is it really not much of a correlation between their relative size and growth and how they're contributing to kind of asset servicing fees? Just trying to see if there's a way of using that data to kind of triangulate to kind of the growth expectations for servicing fees?","Michael William Bell","Yes, Rob, it's Mike. Its -- unfortunately, it's not quite that simple. And as Jay indicated earlier, it is something that we're working on now. How much of that we'll have done by the Investor Day remains to be seen. But let us work to give you an update, hopefully a down payment at the Investor Day and more to come here later in '14.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Rockingham (sic) [Buckingham] Research.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just one or two quick follow-ups, one on the balance sheet. Just your comment that you saw a spike in excess deposits around $6 billion. I'm assuming you're talking about on an average basis because deposits were up $28 billion on a period-end basis, and if you could just sort of -- is the commentary that those -- the vast majority of that $28 billion rolled off? Is that how we should think about it?","Michael William Bell","Sure, Jim, it's Mike. Yes, I was referring to the average. On average, our excess deposits in Q4 were approximately $25 billion compared to $19 billion on average for Q3. Importantly, we saw 2 significant spikes in the fourth quarter. We saw a significant spike in October around the debt ceiling crisis, and then we saw an even larger spike at the end of December that's impacting the period-end number that you're describing. And so again, it was well north even of the numbers that you were quoting. So again, we tend to focus on the period averages because that tends to be more of a driver of the net interest revenue and net interest margin.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","No, absolutely, but so you're saying that the -- that won't have any -- the period-end balances won't have any real impact on the average going into first quarter because they rolled off. Is that the...","Michael William Bell","That's correct, Jim. They rolled off at the beginning of January, not the whole 25, but the spike that we saw at year end rolled off. And I would expect, on average for Q1, it to be below 25, again, barring another crisis in Washington here later in the quarter.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Right, or in emerging markets, I guess. Just a follow-up also on the conversation, you mentioned you would expect it to normalize in 1Q. I wasn't quite sure I understood what you were referring to. Was that sort of the seasonal kind of uptick in incentives? Or -- it wasn't clear to me what you were referring to.","Michael William Bell","Yes, let me just go back to that point. First of all, we will have this $150 million increase in Q1 related to the annual compensation cycle. So put that piece aside. If you strip that out of our Q1 2014 numbers, what I was saying was that if you strip that out, if you took the Q1 2014 versus the Q4 2013, we would expect the comp and benefits to decline over that period, mainly because we don't anticipate those expenses that supported the new business in Q4 to continue through Q1.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And any ballpark on that number?","Michael William Bell","Well, it was the bulk of the rest of the increase from Q3 to Q4 if you strip out the $12 million of the benefit plan change in Q3. So round numbers, call that $15 million. I would, again, anticipate that $15 million not being there in Q1 of '14.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the asset servicing question. If 50% is driven by asset levels and 10% to 15% is transaction, is it possible to generalize about the biggest drivers for the remaining 40%? So is it just number of accounts or the type of service provided, which we really can't see?","Michael William Bell","It tends to be the latter. It tends to be fixed fee arrangements or other particular services, again, just not specifically tied to either transactions or basis points on assets. So again, an example -- I keep harping on it, but just to give the example, $6 million of the -- of the servicing fees from Q3 went away in Q4, and these were out-of-pocket expense recoveries where we do spend money, in this case on information systems, but charge the client dollar for dollar for that. So again, there is a drop in information systems but a drop in revenue. So it's those kinds of things, Cynthia. Again, we'll look to add some transparency on that over time.","Joseph L. Hooley","Let me just give you one other example, Cynthia, because it's a meaningful line item. With each portfolio, if we're doing portfolio accounting, there's a fixed fee to provide that fund accounting, so obviously, that would be driven by the number of portfolios that we add versus assets, just as another example.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then on your outlook for '14, it sounds like you're assuming improvement in market conditions for both sec lending and trading. And I guess the sec lending, it sounds like you think, will be helped by better short-term rates. But what gives you confidence on the trading? And any color you can give on what you're seeing so far this quarter, since 4Q was so slow?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I look on the -- you're right with regard to securities lending. I'd also add another little element which could be helpful, and it came up earlier in the call, that the M&A activity has picked up. And to the extent that stays robust, that would increase the number of special securities, and so that's a helper to securities lending as well. With regard to foreign exchange, it's -- our comments are probably more a reflection of the unusual decline in volatility in the second half of the year, that we don't think that's a normal state of markets.","And I think you can look at the Fed pulling back, you can look at some of the emerging economies and some of their actions as indicators that our base case would be we'd see a little better volatility in this year, 2014, than we saw in '13. And by the way, volumes in our foreign exchange business have been pretty good. So it's really more of a factor of volatility.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And any color on what you're seeing so far this quarter?","Joseph L. Hooley","Too early to tell.","Operator","At this time, I'll turn it back over to management for closing remarks.","Joseph L.

(Operator Instructions).","Now, I would like to introduce Anthony Ostler, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations of State Street.","Anthony Ostler","Thank you very much, Stephanie. Good morning everyone and welcome to our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me on the call is Jay Hooley, Chairman, President and CEO and Mike Bell our Chief Financial Officer.","Prior to discussing our agenda, I'd like to take this opportunity to invite our institutional investors and the analysts to join us for our 2015 Annual Investor and Analyst Forum in New York City on Wednesday February 25.","We have chosen this date as it is our confirmed understanding that one of our larger peers will be holding their Investor Day, a day before on Tuesday February 24th in New York City. We look forward to seeing there, if not before.","Now to our agenda. Jay will discuss the third quarter highlights and Mike will discuss financial results. Our third quarter earnings materials include a slide presentation. Unless otherwise noted, all the financial information discussed on today\u2019s webcast will reflect our operating basis results.","Please note that the operating basis results are a non-GAAP presentation and this webcast includes other non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures, including operating basis results to GAAP basis measures referenced on this webcast, and other related materials, such as the slide presentation referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Mike Bell, will refer to the financial highlights presentation when he provides an overview of our financial results for the third quarter of 2014 which he will refer to as 3Q, \u201814 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 which he will also refer to as year-to-date 2014.","Unless noted separately, Mike will reference only the non-GAAP operating basis results in his comments today. When reviewing our results to comparisons to prior periods, Mike will primarily focus on comparing our 3Q, \u201814 and year-to-date 2014 performance relative to our third quarter 2013 and nine months year-to-date 2013 performance; unless he otherwise notes that the comparison is sequential from our second quarter 2014 results.","Before Jay and Mike begin this discussion of our financial performance, I\u2019d like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street\u2019s 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. We encourage you to review those filings, including the sections on risk factors, concerning any forward-looking statements we make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, October 24, 2014. The corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Jay Hooley.","Jay Hooley","Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I\u2019d like to take a moment to welcome to State Street our new Head of IR, Anthony Ostler. Anthony recently joined us and has over 22 years of financial services experience.","Now to my remarks, our third quarter results demonstrated good core fee growth in asset servicing and asset management, which together were up 9% from the third quarter of 2013, reflecting improved equity markets and new business commitments. Our market driven revenues also performed well in a traditionally seasonally slow quarter. Our pipelines are strong as evidenced by winning new business of $302 billion of assets to be serviced and we had $2 billion of net new assets to be managed this quarter.","On the expense front, we continue to be very focused on controlling cost across our organization. As we have highlighted for you on the past couple of conference calls, we continue to experience increased pressure from regulatory compliance costs and would expect this pressure to continue in future periods. Despite the current challenges we faced some low interest rates, we have leveraged our strong market positions and capabilities to generate profitable top-line growth.","Now, I would like to provide a brief overview of economic and market developments, and how our business was affected.","For the third year in a row, the third quarter has seen economists downgrade their forecast for global growth for the current and coming year. While not uncommon, this quarter's adjustment has had a number of important consequences. Global commodity prices have fallen. This has put further downward pressure on already falling global inflation rates and what has been a very uneven global recovery, this means that deflation has returned as a clear and present danger in a number of economies, especially in the Euro zone.","This has already created a good deal of policy uncertainty. The ECB cut its administrated rates on September 4th in response to mounting pressure to further address the region\u2019s weak growth and loan inflation. Additionally, the ECB also began injecting liquidity into the system putting further downward pressure on market rates. In light of the EBC's decision to reduce deposit and administered rates, we have notified our clients of the potential to charge negative rates or fees on euro deposits. Our plan which is similar to many other banks is to begin charging later this quarter.","In contrast, the response of the Fed to the global slowdown is less clear. Most still project the Fed tightening next year but the timing and scale of rate rises is now a key point of uncertainty. Nevertheless on balance, monetary policy in the U.S. and perhaps the UK will likely diverge in 2015 from the continued easing expected in both the Euro zone and Japan.","These economic divergences and uncertainties appear to have contributed to the return of volatility across assets. Geopolitical factors have also played their part. At the start of the third quarter, volatility across most financial markets was at historically low levels. Several central bank employees is concerned about this complacency as it potentially reflected the underpricing of risk.","There is less cause for this concern now. Volatility has risen consistently across assets, a trend that has continued into the beginning of the fourth quarter. Together these trends impact our business lines in two different ways. First, the growth downgrade and this inflation risk means the low interest rate environment looks likely to stay for a while longer. This continues to negatively impact our net interest revenue and net interest margin as high yielding investments mature pay down and have to be reinvested in lower yielding investments currently available in the market.","We also continue to experience high levels of deposits and for liquidity reasons maintain those that we view as excess with central banks. Another short run implication of the environment is that the low rates have continued to impact the spread associated with our securities finance business.","Second, the benign conditions at the beginning of the third quarter, seems to have void asset values and flows into emerging markets. However, those flows reversed in September as the growth scare impacted risk appetite. This was somewhat offset by the return of volatility in foreign exchange markets. The economic divergence between the U.S. and most of the rest of the world also led to strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the second half of the third quarter. These factors along with heightened risk erosion and an increase in currency market volatility boosted both volumes and FX trading revenues in the third quarter of 2014.","Now, I\u2019d like to talk about the growth of our asset servicing and asset management business. Our third quarter 2014 new asset servicing wins totaled approximately $302 billion, representing a range of clients and sectors. 38% of those assets were from outside the U.S. Also included in the new business were 32 new alternative asset servicing mandates. New assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods totaled $250 billion at quarter-end and our current pipeline continued strong.","In our asset management business, we experienced net inflows of $3 billion for the third quarter. The flows were driven by net inflows of $7 billion into EPS and $1 billion into cash [bonds] partially offset by net outflows of $5 billion from largely passive fixed-income institutional mandates.","Our success in new business commitments across our franchise reflects our efforts to develop continued focus solutions to a continuous innovation. Given our client focus and ability to differentiate our offerings, we expect to build on our new business momentum for the rest of the year.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year.","Mike Bell","Thank you, Jay. Good morning everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to comment regarding the $70 million pre-tax or $53 million after-tax non-operating charge recorded in the third quarter.","This charge reflects our intention to seek to resolve some, but not all of the outstanding and potential claims arising out of our indirect FX client activities. This charge pertains to indirect FX [spenders] which we disclosed over the past few years. It is important to understand that we do not currently intend to seek to negotiate settlements with respect to all outstanding and potential claims.","In addition, our current efforts, even if successful will address only a portion of our potential material legal exposure arising out of our indirect FX client activities. As I\u2019m sure you can appreciate, settlement discussions are confidential and we\u2019re not able to make more specific comments on those matters at this point.","Now turning to slide 9 and note that we\u2019re pleased with our year-to-date 2014 EPS, which has increased approximately 10% relative to 2013. Year-to-date 2014 core servicing and management fee revenue increased approximately 8% compared to the same period in 2013, benefiting for both higher equity markets and net new business. As a result of the strong fee growth, year-to-date 2014 total revenue increased approximately 5% despite the downward pressure on net interest revenue from low market interest rates.","Third quarter 2014 EPS was $1.35 per share, down from second quarter, but up from third quarter of \u201813. The decrease in EPS from second quarter primarily reflects lower revenue related to securities finance seasonality and a higher tax rate this quarter partially offset by the benefit of our share repurchase program. Compared to the third quarter of 2013, EPS increased primarily due to strong growth in our core servicing and management fees, as well as the benefit of our share repurchase program.","Total revenue increased slightly from second quarter even with the seasonal decline in securities finance revenue and increased 8.5% from the third quarter of 2013. Overall, expenses were well controlled in the third quarter, although the result included the benefit from the U.S. dollar relative to second quarter of 2014. The third quarter 2014 operating basis effective tax rate was 31%. We currently expect the full year 2014 operating basis effective tax rate to be in the range of 30% to 31% which implies an expected fourth quarter 2014 rate of approximately 32%.","Now, I\u2019ll discuss additional details regarding our operating basis quarterly revenue as outlined on slide 12. Unless otherwise noted, my comments here will focus on the comparison of third quarter 2014 to third quarter 2013. I believe this is more relevant since the sequential quarter comparison includes the effects of the seasonal pattern in securities finance.","Importantly, servicing fees continue to perform well, up approximately 8% year-over-year. This reflects stronger global equity markets and net new business. Third quarter 2014 asset management fees increased 14.5% from third quarter of last year, primarily due to stronger global equity markets, net new business and higher performance fees. Money market fee waivers were $11 million in third quarter 2014 which was relatively flat.","Trading services revenue increased 5%, reflecting the continued success in our foreign exchange trading which generated higher revenue as a result of increased volumes, partially offset by lower volatility. Securities finance revenue increased approximately 34%, primarily due to higher volumes in both our enhanced custody and agency businesses.","Processing fees and other revenue increased from a year ago, primarily due to higher revenue associated with our tax advantaged investments and other fees partially offset by some valuation adjustments. Our net interest revenue also increased from third quarter of last year, benefiting from a higher level of interest earning assets. I would note that the third quarter 2014 net interest revenue also included a $5 million benefit from the prepayment of a corporate bond. Net interest revenue and net interest margin continue to be pressured from the persistent low interest rate environment and the reinvestment of the portfolio in the high quality liquid assets to meet the new liquidity requirements.","Many of you\u2019ve had questions regarding the European Central Bank lowering the overnight deposit rate to negative 20 basis points and the related impact on a deposit pricing. As market interest rates have continued to drift lower, we\u2019ve notified our clients on potential for us to charge negative rates or fees on all balances. And as Jay described, our plan is to begin charging for negative rates later this quarter.","Based upon our current assessment of market conditions, we expect operating basis net interest revenue for 2014 to be near the high-end of the $2.25 billion to $2.28 billion range that we previously communicated on our second quarter conference call. This estimate reflects a decline in net interest revenue relative to the third quarter of 2014 actual result, due to the impact of lower market interest rates and the impact of increasing our HQLA to comply with liquidity requirements. It also incorporates our estimated impact of the unfavorable interest rate environment in Europe.","Now moving to slide 13, I\u2019ll provide some comments on operating basis expenses. Compared to third quarter of 2013, our total operating expenses increased approximately 7% primarily reflecting new business support, higher regulatory compliance costs higher transaction, processing and occupancy expenses. In addition, third quarter 2013 expenses included the impact of lower employee benefit expenses, resulting from plan changes, and a $30 million benefit related to Lehman Brothers related gains and recoveries.","Compared to second quarter of 2014, our total third quarter operating expenses benefited by approximately $16 million, due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Third quarter 2014 compensation employee benefits expenses decreased from second quarter, primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower incentive compensation costs. Additionally, third quarter 2014 includes a $4 million credit related to our pension adjustment.","Transaction and processing expenses were higher than second quarter, primarily due to higher equity values and higher servicing volumes. Occupancy expenses of a $119 million, increased 3.5% compared to second quarter, due to a one time recovery of $5 million last quarter.","Third quarter 2014 other expenses included a $20 million contribution to our charitable foundation partially offset by a $15 million insurance related recovery. In addition, third quarter 2014 other expenses were lower due to some delays of external consulting expenses, which we now expect will be spent in fourth quarter of 2014.","Now, I\u2019ll provide comments on our September 30th balance sheet. As you can see on slide 14, our overall approach to managing our investment portfolio has evolved to reflect the impact of complying with emerging liquidity roles which is most evident in an $8 billion of U.S. treasuries that we purchased in third quarter of 2014.","We intend to be in full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio requirements by January 1, 2015. Our interest rate risk position also reflects the impacts of our actions to comply with the LCR roles and we remain comfortable with this risk position.","Additionally, the after tax unrealized mark-to-market gain as of September 30, was $411 million which is lower than June 30th due to a modest increase in market interest rates partially offset by an improvement from narrowing spreads.","Now turning to slide 15 to review our capital position. Our capital position remained strong and that strength has enabled us to deliver on our key priority of returning value to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. As of September 30 of 2014, our holding company Tier 1 common ratio under the current Basel III advanced approach was 12.7%. Under the Basel III standardize approach, which will not go into effect until 2015, our holding company estimated pro forma Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 10.9%. We estimate that our Basel III supplementary leverage ratios under our interpretation of the final U.S. rules are approximately 5.7% at the holding company and approximately 5.4% at the bank as of September 30, 2014.","Generally speaking, our capital ratios were lower in third quarter of 2014 versus second quarter. The main contributors to the decline were a larger average balance sheet driven in part by higher levels of client deposits and the reduction in common equity from the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar following through foreign currency translation.","Now as I mentioned, returning capital to shareholders continues to be a top priority. During the third quarter of 2014, we purchased approximately 5.8 million shares of our common stocks at a total cost of approximately $410 million resulting in average fully diluted common shares outstanding of approximately $430 million for the quarter.","As of September 30, 2014, we had approximately $880 million remaining on our current common stock purchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.7 billion of our common stock through March 31, 2015.","So by way of summary, third quarter 2014 results were driven by the strength of our core servicing and management fees and positive momentum in creating services. Core servicing and management fees grew 8% compared to year-to-date 2013 which demonstrates our success in the market. In spite the headwinds on our net interest revenue; we're well positioned to achieve our full year 2014 operating basis revenue growth target of 3% to 5%.","On the expense front, we continue to feel pressure from higher regulatory expectations. And in addition, we continue to believe that our common stock repurchase program combined with dividends is the best way to return value to shareholders.","So prior to wrapping up, I thought I\u2019ll address a question that is likely to be on investors and the analysts minds and that is, what is our outlook for fourth quarter 2014? Fourth quarter revenue performance could be impacted by overall market conditions in the quarter. In addition as I mentioned earlier, we expect fourth quarter net interest revenue to decrease relative to the third quarter 2014 results. We currently expect fourth quarter 2014 expenses to be higher due to the continued upward pressure on our regulatory-related costs and the delayed timing of some expenses from third quarter. Nevertheless, our goal is to generate positive operating leverage for the full year 2014, although the fourth quarter market conditions pose risk that are not completely in our direct control.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Jay.","Jay Hooley","Thanks Mike. And Stephanie, we're now -- Mike and I are now available to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Jay Hooley","Good morning.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Just wondering if you could talk about the two core fee businesses in a little bit more depth, and services first, you had a modest growth and I am just wondering if you can help us understand the impact of FX and also just the commentary on the transaction activity this quarter versus last?","Jay Hooley","Yes. Let me start that Ken and Mike will pick it up. As far as core services I\u2019d start with the custody service fee base, which was up nicely year-over-year, up a little bit quarter-to-quarter. A reflection in order to priority the markets and we continue to see stronger business growth. We posted $2 billion of new committed business this quarter; there is 250 still to install. So we\u2019ve had a couple of nice quarters of good momentum in the marketplace.","Let me just bridge into foreign exchange, which was another positive performer in the quarter. So, a few things, the volumes and volatility were helper in the third quarter. And I would say, volumes consistently, volatility really moving from front to back of quarter improved September in particular given the things that I noted. I\u2019d also broaden it out to say that foreign exchange is a pretty wide variety of service capabilities which we provide both to our custody customers, as well as our non-custody customers. And we continue to see good momentum in I would say generally the electronic trading part of foreign exchange, FX Connect and more recently 3FX, which is the hourly priced against an index. And even more recently in September, we introduced a new FX vehicle called TruCross, which is designed to allow those who don't want to trade against the WM fix to -- basically it's a trading platform buy side to buy side.","So, I would say, market environment was good particularly towards the end of the quarter and generally volumes were pretty consistent across all platforms. Mike, I don't know you want to add.","Mike Bell","Yes. Ken, just add a couple of other facts just to support your quarter-over-quarter analysis. So relative to second quarter, the stronger U.S. dollar depressed our service fees by $10 million. So, if you\u2019ve done it on a constant currency basis rather than 1.302, it would be 1.312, if you used constant currency. In addition, the transaction revenue was down $4 million sequentially. Obviously we've got a little bit of help from market, so there were pretty sideways if you include Europe. So, as you can see, the underlying net new business revenue was very helpful in the core GS business here in Q3.","As it relates to management fees, as I said in my prepared remarks, the main benefit that we got there relative to second quarter is a combination of positive net new business as well as our performance fees; there the FX impact was negative two from a sequential standpoint. And in grand total for our revenue, so inclusive of $12 million I just talked about, FX hurt revenue by approximately $21 million relative to Q2 and had a little bit less from that impact on the expenses Q2 to Q3.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay, great. And my second question is just to your commentary on the push out in some of those consulting costs into the fourth quarter. Can you help us understand what didn\u2019t get spend this quarter and the type of magnitude that you\u2019re talking about from a third quarter to fourth quarter overall increase in expenses?","Mike Bell","Sure, absolutely Ken. So this mainly relates Ken to the timing of our regulatory compliance spending, so it\u2019s mainly outside consultants. And so basically where we expected to spend on outside consultancy in Q3, we expect that now still to be spent, but delayed into Q4. And I would range that in the call it $10 million to $15 million kind of range.","Now I\u2019d emphasize the operating expenses category as I talked about in the past, could be pretty lumpy, because we can add some, for example some legal costs in there and even the outside consulting spend tends to be pretty lumpy. But that was what I was referencing.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay, got it. So overall expenses, you are still -- and sometimes you typically have like a true up maybe on the comp side. But are you trying to also say that you expect overall expenses then to be distinctly higher in the fourth or just that portion of it?","Mike Bell","No, we do expect it to be distinctly higher, so the guidance that I had given at Q2 where we thought that Q3 would be 20 million higher than Q2 and Q4 would be 20 million higher than Q2, in aggregate there really has not been a change in our expense view other than number one with the stronger U.S. dollar, we got $16 million benefit in expenses in Q3. Obviously the Q4 benefit, if U.S. dollar continues to be strong will be what it\u2019ll be relative to Q2, but the currency helped the expense of $16 million in Q3. And then as I said, the timing between the two quarters will reflect the delay in the spending that I just mentioned.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Understood. Thanks Mike.","Operator","Your next quarter comes from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","Good morning guys.","Jay Hooley","Good morning.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","Mike, just hoping you could flash out where you stand on LCR today and just your latest thoughts around preferred issuance?","Mike Bell","Sure. Good morning Ashley. Regarding LCR, as we\u2019ve talked about previously, we do expect to fully be in compliance by year-end with the Fed's expectations. And we estimate that if we calculated that LCR as of September 30th, we would be in excess of the 80%.","Now, I would tell you that following up on a question you asked me last quarter Ashley, the final Fed expectations regarding the actual calculation of operational deposits is not entirely clear. It's sort of slowly getting clear but not entirely clear. And that\u2019s as a result, following up on the question you asked me last quarter, at some point, we need to firm up the overall impact on our NIR. I would expect it to be modestly higher impact than what we had communicated previously but we\u2019ll have some more information on that in 2015.","And as it relates to the preps, first of all, no change in that for the risk based capital ratios; we would ultimately want to get to 1.5% at a minimum of our overall capital structure being prep. So that would equate to approximately $1.8 billion. So that means we need another $500 million at some point relative to the balance of preps that we have currently.","So just looking at the risk based ratios, no change in our expectations. The wildcard continues to be, Ashley, around compliance with the supplementary leverage ratio. And since at this point, it still looks like the supplementary leverage ratio will likely be our binding constraint. I would say it is likely we will go beyond the $1.8 billion that I just referenced and ultimately issue more press than that. Again at this point, I wouldn\u2019t give an updated number or an update on timing, but that continues to be our thinking.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks for the color there. And then just on the current reinvestment environment, I appreciate the guidance for this year. But just maybe a sense around what the reinvesting deals are in the U.S. versus Europe? And then any thoughts on what a flatter yield curve means for you in net interest revenue sensitivity would be appreciated?","Mike Bell","Sure. Well, as you can imagine, it\u2019s a little early to talk about 2015 because there are so many different moving parts going on there. Obviously, if we got to a flatter yield curve by an increase in short-term interest rates, we would view that as a very positive thing, particularly given that we\u2019ve got about half of our portfolio is invested in floating rate securities. So, an increase in short-term rates will be very helpful.","I would also reiterate that we will particularly benefit from the first call it 50 basis point increase in -- the first 25 basis point of increase in short-term rates would likely accrue very heavily to our benefit, but even the second 25 basis point increase would also help us. So, if we get to a flat yield curve by raising the short-term rates that would be a very good thing.","As it relates to Q4, we\u2019ve got some obvious headwinds. We\u2019ve got first of all, Q4 you don\u2019t want to back out the $5 million benefit we got in Q3 from the prepayment on that corporate bond, so I would do that right off the top. But then we\u2019ve got three other items that are driving down our expectations for NIR in fourth quarter. They are; number one, Europe, as you just mentioned, the market interest rates in Europe have dropped between 20 and 25 basis points at the short-end over the last five months. The [ECB] has obviously cut the rate from zero now to minus 20 in that same period.","So, as Jay talked about, we're working to pass along that cost to our clients. So, but that will still be a headwind for Q4. In addition, we have now higher level of HQLA that's going to be a drag because we're obviously not doing any spread on the HQLA. And then third is just a normal grind as the portfolio matures and rolls off. So, as a result of all those things, we expect Q4 to be lower than Q3 from an NIR perspective. I think it's too early to try to speculate on 2015.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks for all the details there, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Just ISI. Thank you.","Jay Hooley","Excellent.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","And I don't have a [bow] either. So, just one point Mike on the clarification of the 4Q costs, in a standing steady state world, currency neutral fourth quarter from third quarter. We might add back that $16 million benefit on currency, the $10 million to $15 million catch up on the delayed consulting cost and then another $20 million on top for what was already planned on the consulting cost. I just want to make sure that I have that right?","Mike Bell","Yes that's fair, Glenn. I mean that probably puts more precision on it than it is warranted because again some of those other operating expenses are pretty lumpy. But directionally you are thinking about it just fine.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Okay. And then on the regulatory question, we think of them as having a big seasonal component, because basically June through December is hot and heavy, or is this annual run rate thought process? In other words, should we get a benefit in first quarter as CCAR\u2019s done and you take a breath?","Mike Bell","Yes. Unfortunately Glenn, I mean there are a lot of moving parts to answer your question. You're certainly right that I would expect CCAR specific cost particularly outside consulting expenses to decline in Q1 of \u201815. But unfortunately, CCAR is just part of a wide horizon of regulatory expectation. So, I think it\u2019s a little early to speculate on Q1 2015 or even full year 2015 regulatory compliance costs; we\u2019re in the midst of the budget process as we speak.","Again, a lot of moving parts, just to sort of give you a flavor for it, first of all I said before, we\u2019re seeing regulatory expenses, excuse me, regulatory expectations be higher in a number of different areas, not just CCAR. So that\u2019s putting some upward pressure on expenses. On the other hand, we do expect over the course of 2015 to be able to reduce our reliance on outside consulting expenses and ultimately replace that more with full time employees. So we expect to get some cost arbitrage there. So again, a little early to try to conclude on 2015 at this point.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Okay. And then maybe just a very high level thought because it\u2019s so new. CCAR stress test came out last night. And I would just say particular to you guys balance sheet\u2019s grown 27%, it\u2019s help to offset some of the NIM compression. But the test specifically has wider credit spreads and a flatter curve relative to last year. Is this just a little bit worse, is a lot worse? I\u2019m just trying to get your gut reaction given the importance of that part of the test for you guys.","Mike Bell","Glenn, obviously we've had less than 24 hours to fully digest it and to run it through our models and such. But I would characterize it as modestly worse than last years, but again with the caveat that I am sure there will be some other devils in the details. But particularly the fact that the equity market decline would be higher than last year would be a particular area given our concentration in terms of our clients on equity assets.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Hey guys, good morning.","Jay Hooley","Good morning.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","So, a bigger picture question I guess when we think about State Street\u2019s exposure to Europe. You guys clearly have significant business there and there is number. There is not a place as obviously where it hits the P&L, both on the NIR side with respect to securities rolling over but also as you kind of translate from euros to the dollar. As we think about the enterprise as a whole, strengthening dollar I am assuming is not a great thing but maybe you can flush that out a little bit more and give us a sense of from a pre-tax dollar perspective what the sensitivity could be?","Jay Hooley","Let me start that because I think it has -- there is a revenue side to that and there is an expense side. And Mike can pick up the currency effect as well as the effect potentially on the portfolio. But from a revenue side being our ability to generate servicing fees and management fees really unaffected, it\u2019s anything neutral to positive. I think if you look at our new business momentum over the past several quarters, Europe has been a little bit of a bright spot. I\u2019d even go a little deeper to say if you look at flows which is the other element of a critical element of organic flows; the offshore markets continue to perform exceptionally well, Thailand and Luxembourg where we had deep presence. So, from a standpoint of the fee revenues, I don\u2019t really see effect that the Euro zone continues to have difficulties affecting that, in fact if anything that\u2019s a little bit positive. Mike, why don\u2019t you talk about that?","Mike Bell","Sure. So, Alex, first from a P&L standpoint, I would characterize this as being relatively neutral to the FX changes because roughly speaking, it\u2019s not perfectly accurate, but roughly speaking, our revenue in different currencies tends to match our expense structure in different currencies. So, I would characterize this as roughly neutral out there.","As it relates to the impact on our capital levels, we\u2019re modestly exposed, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as material, but we\u2019re modestly exposed to the fact that we\u2019ve got some capital in non-U.S. currencies. And therefore -- and that\u2019s really weighted a little more heavily than for example the risk weighted assets in those same currencies. So as an example, what we saw at the end of third quarter was when the euro weakened so much relative to the U.S. dollar, we saw an impact on the September 30th currency translation and therefore that negatively impacted our capital ratios at Q3. Once again, I don\u2019t view that as a long-term threat, but I do view it as a source of fluctuation that can go either way quarter-to-quarter.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thanks for all that detail. And then the second question is -- and I appreciate the fact that it\u2019s still probably quite early. But as we think about NSFR and the way it could impact the broader securities lending industry. I was just hoping to get your thoughts on your business with respect to; a, your growth in enhanced custody to you think can stand where does you see a little bit of a principle business for you, but also the secondary impact and kind of what your core agency business?","Jay Hooley","So, let me start at Alex. Mike noted that our securities finance business this quarter was particularly healthy when you contrast it against last year\u2019s same quarter. And the growth was driven by better loan volume overall I would say of the growth. Two-thirds of it roughly was enhanced custody versus the agency business.","So, generally good strength in the securities lending business, I don't see that abating. I think your question was to the NSFR. In our enhanced custody business, we have found ways to minimize the capital effect through netting with the counterparties that we\u2019re lending securities to, which has resulted in a pretty capital efficient trade.","So, as we look at enhanced custody, which is a business that we see not only have seen good growth in, but we see the prospect for even increased growth. We think it can be done on a reasonably capital efficient basis. Mike would you add to that?","Mike Bell","Yes. Alex the only thing I would add that Jay is exactly right. The only thing I would add is that I do expect that prices will likely increase in that market particularly for those clients where we can't reach netting agreements with them. And I don't think that would be just us, I think that will be a phenomenon across the marketplace.","So, our orally read is exactly what Jay said. We do expect this to be attractive business for us from the capital return standpoint overtime particularly with the [NIM].","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Understood. Thank you. Thanks so much for all the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein","Good morning. Just following up Alex\u2019s question, I was curious if you could elaborate on it appears to be a little bit of improvement in securities lending, you seem to think that\u2019s maybe a little bit durable. But perhaps you could address what you\u2019re seeing in terms of structural changes since the crisis, what types of splits you\u2019re getting with client, the level of participation programs and the demand for activity related to collateral versus special lending?","Jay Hooley","Let me start that again Luke. If I take it up and broaden it, the participation securities lending from a customer standpoint has been stable to maybe slightly up. So, we\u2019ve come through a long cycle over the past six years of people leaving the program then rejoining the program. And that\u2019s been pretty stable if not say anything it\u2019s a plus some adds.","If you look at the -- now the other thing you\u2019d look at would be unknown balances which have been over the past couple of quarters running at about $350 billion plus or minus. Within that the loan growth has been good and the attractiveness of spread is particularly driven by merger and acquisition activity driving specials. Again has been a positive in the last couple of quarters.","You asked about structural changes, the one that comes to my -- most to me is this decrease in leverage that the banks are going through. And as a result, we\u2019ve seen the prime brokers be a little bit more selective about lending, which has really opened the window for that enhanced custody business that we frequently talk about. So, I would say if you look at sustainability, durability of trends that are going on, you can make your own judgment about whether the M&A activity will continue to be robust. But other than that, I think I would say it looks pretty durable from the standpoint of trend.","Mike Bell","Yes, Luke. It's Mike. The only thing that I would add is just thinking about it from a quarter-to-quarter perspective, first of all with the bad news and then with the good news. On the bad news side, Q1 was pretty difficult, spreads were tight. But as Jay said, we saw with the dividend arm season spreads and volumes pick up in Q2; in Q3 the volumes and spreads were attractive for example relative to a year ago. And again we attribute that primarily to higher M&A volume, higher IPO volume, and again whether it's durable into the future is a little bit of a crystal ball question but we're certainly happy with the trends we've seen over the last six months.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein","Great. Really helpful. And then on the FX settlements, I think I recall a few years ago when this broke, you seemed fairly resolute that the cases that didn't have a lot of merit. And I know it's difficult to say much given that you still have a number of cases pending, but maybe hoping you could provide some detail about why you decided it was in your best interest to settle in these specific cases? And then maybe in terms of order of magnitude or just number of cases how much of this might be behind us?","Mike Bell","Yes, Luke. First of all, just to be clear, we're not announcing settlement on these cases but these are basically situations where we are putting up reserves based upon additional information that we have. And I would not try to speculate what percentage of the overall pie this is going to relate to in terms of the indirect FX business; I think it\u2019s way too early to try to size that.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for the clarification. And then just a real quick technical question; wondering how you plan to charge for negative rates, whether you determine that will appear as a credit to NII or the fee more or is that going to just differ across other clients?","Mike Bell","Yes. Luke, it\u2019s likely to differ by client and differ by country, so different by a jurisdiction but I would expect at this point speculating that the vast bulk of that would show up as positive fees. But once again, more to come there.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Good morning guys. Thanks for the taking the question. First one on the balance sheet. So, we saw a pretty nice sequential increase in deposits here. How much of that was non-operating? And do you have any insight into what might have driven some of the growth given how strong it was?","Mike Bell","Yes Brennan, it\u2019s Mike. First of all, we expect -- we estimate that the underlying growing in our core business was about call it $2 billion to 3 billion of the growth in our overall deposits. And the remainder of the growth in the balance sheet was a combination of growth in excess deposits as well as some issuance of wholesale CDs which were an important part of our plan to comply with the LCR.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay. And that $2 billion to $3 billion is both U.S. and international?","Mike Bell","That\u2019s correct. That would be a combined number.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay, terrific. And then thinking about the delta in SLR, clearly balance sheet growth was part of the drop there, sequential 40 basis points; AOCI looked like it fell too. Were those the main drivers and could you break down the 40 basis points and what were the main allocations specifically the big factors?","Mike Bell","Sure Brennan. So, those are the two main pieces. The growth in the balance sheet was approximately two-thirds of the 40 basis-point decline in the SLR and the other third when you\u2019re referencing AOCI, that's mainly the currency translation adjustment that I mentioned earlier, what we saw a drop in the euro rate pretty significantly at September 30th. Again from foreign currency translation standpoint, that's calculated on a spot basis based on currency rates as of September 30. So, it had a -- the drop in the euro had a disproportionate negative impact on the value of our euro capital as it gets converted to U.S. dollars and that was about a third of the 40 basis-point decline.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning.","Jay Hooley","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","So, just a couple of follow-ups, one on the [Altera], I just wanted to make sure I understood it will be 80% by 1\/1\/15 and the 100% is the next year 1\/1\/16. Is that accurate?","Mike Bell","Betsy, let me just repeat what I said earlier. We do expect to be comfortably well above the 80% at 1\/1\/15. We do estimate that we'd be above the 80% as of now. But we would expect to have a very comfortable margin relative to the 80% at 1\/1\/15.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","I just wondered because you mentioned full compliance, so I wasn\u2019t sure if that meant full compliance with the interim step or the final step so?","Jay Hooley","Yes. Again, I would characterize this as we\u2019re in full compliance of the 80% now, but the -- I do think at the end of the day our regulators would expect overtime for us to have a significant buffer relative to the 80% and I would expect to meet that buffer at 1150.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then on just the European deposits and the negative interest rate you\u2019re going to be charging due to the fact that ECB is charging you 20 bps. Can you give us a sense as to how you\u2019re talking about with clients? And I\u2019m wondering is there a way that some of your clients can avoid this potentially from going from euro to another currency or through getting discounts for more soft dollars or is there -- just wanted to understand how your positioning is?","Jay Hooley","Betsy, this is Jay. First off, 45 days ago we informed customers of our intent. I think to me the question will be, is this charge enough to cause people to deal with their excess deposits in a different way. We would expect that there will be some for those deposits and that\u2019s probably a positive thing overall for us. But I don\u2019t think it would cause customers to change investment strategies or anything that would relate to those excess deposits, I think it\u2019s just a matter of -- is the charge enough of a deterrent to keep deposits with us and therefore would they could they in some form move some of those deposits away from our balance sheet. But I think that\u2019s the extent of the impact.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Have you seen any activity to-date from when you announced you were intending to charge this? I'm wondering if people have already started to move out of euro to other currencies or you just really haven't seen much behavioral change yet?","Jay Hooley","We have not seen any behavioral change. And while we think about the intent, we won't start charging until later on in the quarter.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Right. Okay. And then just lastly on the preps, I know you indicated that there is another plug for us to do here at some point when market conditions -- I'm just wondering what's your sense on that kind of timing or when you'd want to get that done. You probably were thinking maybe to do it by the end of 3Q that just passed for CCAR reasons. But just like to get a sense as to how you're thinking about it given the fact that some restrictions come down so much. Is there an opportunity here?","Jay Hooley","Sure. And Betsy, this is something that we're looking at. At this point, I wouldn't commit to a specific timing. But I would say just to give up a high level answer, I would certainly expect within the next 12 months that we would look for a potential window to go ahead and get a $500 million, but it will depend upon market conditions, it will depend upon our outlook. So, I'd say a number of different factors to think about.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi. I wanted to go back to lend a little bit. Jay, how do you view the market share shifts in overall custody? On the one hand you mentioned that the strong new business growth this quarter, which is a positive. On the other hand, it looks like some smaller players in Europe wants the mandates over the past year. And even further back just a big picture question. When we look at State Street's market share almost a decade ago and adjust for your acquisitions of Goldman in 2012, Intesa in 2009, Investor\u2019s Financial in 2007. It looks like your market share on a core basis adjusting for those acquisitions would be a little bit less in overall custody, regardless of what degree of [discrete], how you think about that market share would be helpful?","Jay Hooley","Sure. I can\u2019t track all the numbers that you have Mike without doing a little math on my own but I would say generally we focus, we\u2019re most concerned about market share in the most attractive markets that as we view them. So, if you look at I would say, starting out broadly asset servicing -- not asset servicing, but asset management versus asset owners, so investment management versus pension funds, by our math, we have held if not gained market share over long periods of time in the asset servicing for asset managers; pension funds probably a little bit more stable. So that would be my first cut at it.","But then I would probably go a little deeper Mike, and if you look at some other faster growing streams in the world, I\u2019d start with the alternatives, hedge, private equity, real-estate, 10 years ago we were nowhere that was in the market, today we\u2019re the market leader by quite a bit and I think are positioned to continue to grow and gain share. I\u2019d look at another fast stream; I\u2019m in the U.S. right now, primarily ETF market which is close to $2 trillion now. We have a pretty significant share of the ETF servicing marketplace, so again fast growing market where we have established early position and have grown disproportionately with the market.","And then, I guess the third place I would go is the derivative of the asset management market, if you look at the European market where we have a deep presence. Our market share leadership in both the Irish and Luxembourg offshore markets is pretty commanding and I would say continuing to grow. So, I look at the question and I break it down as I always do to say, as you look you in your crystal ball, which of the geographies, which is the markets, and which are the products that we think have a higher growth trajectories and making sure. I think we've done a pretty good job and getting in front of those growth markets that have turned out to be pretty attractive. So, that's one cut at it.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","That's helpful. And so just going back to the core custody business away from those growth areas that you emphasized, how is competition currently compared to the past? Is it getting easier and you're gaining more business that way or is it harder or what's the rate of change?","Jay Hooley","I would say it never gets easier. But I think it's I would say largely unchanged. I would say and it depends a lot by market. In the U.S., there are two or three different verticals, you have mostly U.S. competitors, we all have strength and weaknesses. If you go to Europe, you'll introduce a few additional competitors. I would say Mike that over the years following the financial crisis and particularly last couple of years, pricing has seemed a little bit more stable to me; there can be a situation where somebody will throw in irresponsible place. But I would say most of us in the servicing side of the business are being a little bit more careful about and thoughtful I should say about how we price these opportunities.","I\u2019d also say what's helped that and I know we\u2019ve done some of this, but we're not alone is particularly when you have an intermediary in the sales process, a consultant in particular. We\u2019ve been really to walk away from deals that didn\u2019t make economic sense; I\u2019ve seen others do that as well. And I think over time that can create a little bit of a firming up or bottoming of the pricing.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Are you willing to give up market share when the pricing doesn\u2019t make sense a little more often?","Jay Hooley","Absolutely.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Hi, good morning folks.","Jay Hooley","Good morning.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but just couple of more to drill down a little bit deeper. On the -- just looking at the average balance sheet on the deposit pricing, I guess first of all, take a picture of what do you view as your level of excess deposits right now? And then in terms of the impact, if you can go into a little bit more granularity on charging for -- when you charge for deposits later in the quarter, how that\u2019s going to impact the -- just looking at the average balance sheet, the average yield on your interest bearing deposits down 5 basis points linked quarter. How you see that dynamic changing because you mentioned there will be a fee offset; and where that would come in on fees on the P&L?","Mike Bell","Okay. So Brian, it's Mike. First of all, on your question on excess deposits, we estimate that our excess deposits at the end of -- I\u2019m sorry not at the end of third quarter, during the average of third quarter was approximately $48 billion. And so we expect that in third quarter, we were earning a NIM on those assets, call it in the high-teens, down what we\u2019ve given in the past an estimated NIM on excess deposits of 20 basis points.","The fact that the rates dropped in euro, the short-term interest rates dropped in euro, call it 20 to 25 basis points over the last five months mean that would push the overall NIM down to the teen\u2019s level. I would expect that there is at least the potential for the excess deposits to decline in Q4 if in fact the [rural] excess deposits that we\u2019re getting in negative rate would go somewhere else, but that's speculated I probably speculated that all year and that long as excess deposits continue to grow. So I don't know how much confidence that gives you in that estimate.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","But then as you charge for this, assuming some of the deposits stay we should see a pick up in the net interest margin that you just outlined from the high-teens?","Mike Bell","I think I'm not sure that's actually the case because we're likely to pick up a partial quarter for the most part, and maybe modestly higher fee revenue as a result of charging for deposit. So, I don't think that's going to help the NIR per se. We're earning negative interest rates on the asset side of those excess deposits. And again I think the negative rate credit decline will show up likely in all likelihood of fees not improves NIR.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Then [segueing] to fees, first of all would that show up in the core investment service fee line? And then secondarily, if you back out the impacts you said from both volumes and FX currency translation versus the second quarter, your fee growth is actually stronger about 2%. So, just going back into some of Jay's comments earlier about some of the risk-off, I think you were saying, Jay some of the risk-off in later September looking into fourth quarter. How should we think about that positioning in terms of your yield on those custody and the [liquid] assets?","Mike Bell","So Brian on your first piece again, I do think that negative credited rates on deposits in Europe would likely show up in the service fees. I mean we\u2019re talking a few million dollars I mean this is not a big ticket item. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to hugely move the needle relative to the other factors. And I\u2019m just going back to the earlier question, I wouldn\u2019t say that for the most part the improvement that we got Q2 to Q3 in global services revenues X the impact of currency and X the impact of transaction it was mainly net new business volumes. Jay wants to comment on the risk-on risk-off question.","Jay Hooley","Yes. I would say, picking up on my prepared remarks, Brian, there was a little bit of risk-on at the beginning of the quarter and became risk-off at the end of the quarter somewhat offset by the volatility in foreign exchange or currency markets.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Jay Hooley","And the equity markets have come back a little bit, so it\u2019s hard to predict at this point.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","All right, okay. No, that\u2019s helpful color. Great, thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","Hi Mike. A quick question for you, on this incentive comp reduction that you had in the third quarter, was there a reversal of an accrual and if so how much?","Mike Bell","Yes. Vivek, there is not a reversal of an accrual in terms of incentive comp. What happens is that the way we accrue incentive comp it tends to accrue based upon our overall level of earnings I mean there are some adjustments that go into it plus and minus. But as a result of again those factors, the accrual was slightly lower. That was not a material impact in the quarter itself.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","Okay. And then secondly, your ABS came down pretty sharply in the quarter, while I guess treasuries went up. So that's the change going on, I'm presuming. And how much more do you need to do in that?","Mike Bell","So, first of all, you are right in terms of your description. We did have a major security sale in the quarter and basically reinvested the proceeds in U.S. treasuries that's all part of being LCR compliance. In terms of how much more we need to do, as I mentioned in an answer to an earlier question, the overall regulatory expectations regarding the calculation of operational deposits under the LCR requirements is still not entirely clear. So, I\u2019d rather not try to be pin down to a number, when it's a moving target at this point.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","You mentioned that the net interest income impact from the LCR was probably going to be a big higher than you discussed previously. So, I wonder what was in the final rules that were different from what you've been expecting.","Mike Bell","Yes, Geoff, it's Mike. I'd assume a number of different factors and some of it actually relates to the underlying expectations of the calculation itself as opposed to change in the rules. But as an example, we have what we view to be operational deposits from both hedge fund clients as well as private equity clients that are explicitly excluded from the regulatory definition of operational deposits. I mean we view that as unfortunate, but those are the rules. So that would be an example of something that will push up our need to hold more HQLA that we previously thought.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","And then my second question is on the FX trading revenues. Can you give a sense of how those were distributed over the quarter; was there a big pick up late in the quarter as (inaudible) came back or was it kind of more even throughout?","Jay Hooley","I would say, Geoff, this is Jay. It was slightly tilted towards the back end of the quarter, followed the volatility change throughout the quarter that I mentioned; volumes were pretty steady throughout.","Mike Bell","Geoff, it\u2019s Mike. I would just add the volumes have really been strong, as Jay indicated. So again, we view that as a very positive thing and also a positive sign that the investments that we\u2019ve made in our direct FX capabilities over the last several years are really paying good dividends.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Right. So strong volumes were out and that kind of take it from the volatility at the end?","Mike Bell","Correct.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Good morning. Just a follow-up on the preferred issuance thought process around the SLR. It seems to me that if you take a balance sheet back to where it was a year ago and assume some of these excess deposits run-off, as rates eventually move higher. You add based on my back of the envelop, almost 100 basis points to SLR and then all of a sudden it\u2019s not a constraint. So as you think about meeting that at least temporary constraint with preferred, does it make sense to wait to see how the excess deposits? I just want to get a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about the additional preferred above 1.5%?","Mike Bell","Sure Jim, it\u2019s Mike. First, what you're describing is rational and that is part of the overall calculus in terms of the prep issuance as I was mentioning to Betsy; there are a number of different things to think about. One of those of course is what will happen to excess deposits, particularly when rates rise.","The other piece though that you didn't mention and I feel compelled to mention is remember that by the time we get to 2018 and the SLR is fully in effect, we will have lost all of the interim credit on the intangibles. And so we estimate that that's worth about 40 basis points. So on a pro forma the 5.4 down to 5.0 for the loss of that credit on the tangibles. And then as you said, you could considerably boost it by a 100 basis points if you assumed all the excess deposits found in different home. We probably still want to have some kind of buffer off the six. So I wouldn't characterize preps as being our only lever but that would be a scenario where we might meet all the items that you mentioned and still end up with additional preps.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay. That's helpful and makes sense. And then just maybe a follow up on the NSFR, have you looked at all how that may impact the way you think; is there more liquidity you need about the LCR, or do you feel like the NSFR is at the least the way it's proposed so far is pretty manageable?","Mike Bell","Jim, again, as you can imagine, it's early since we don't have any final rules to evaluate. I think it would be a little bit early to say anything definitively. I think based upon our interpretation of the preliminary guidance, it would require some additional HQLA, but I think the devil will be in the details of the final rules and I wouldn't try to speculate and try to put a number on it at this point.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Beatty with Bank of America.","Adam Beatty - Bank of America","Thank you and good morning. Just one question from me today; in regards to your operating leverage target, I was just wondering given where your business sits right now and where the market conditions are? Would you need in terms of it be subject to market conditions would you need the market to revert to more of an upward trend with flat from here allowing you to achieve operating leverage, what\u2019s the color around that? Also it seems like you\u2019re somewhat confident about heading your goal in terms of revenue growth, to me that sort of points to expenses as maybe the risk around operating leverage maybe if you could just flag up the biggest risk that you see? Thanks.","Mike Bell","Sure. Adam, it\u2019s Mike. Again, there are number of different factors that will impact the Q4 revenue. Obviously as we talked about earlier, we were pleased with the Q3 results in particularly the strength in our core servicing and management fees and then the additional benefit that we got from the strong direct FX trading results and also the securities lending business both enhanced custody and the agency businesses, obviously we\u2019re pleased with all of that. Exactly what conditions are going to be in Q4 in all of those areas; it\u2019s too early to tell.","Having said that, we\u2019re at 5% year-over-year revenue growth through nine months, I certainly expect that we\u2019ll [barrowing] that catastrophe meet the 3% to 5% overall revenue target. But you\u2019re absolutely right; the expenses have been a headwind for 2014 mainly the regulatory compliance costs are the main item that we had not anticipated at the beginning of the year when we were laying out our budget targets and expectations for full year.","I think we\u2019ve actually done a pretty good job in Q3 offsetting the impact of the higher regulatory expenses by finding other savings in other areas and opportunities to redeploy staff as opposed to having it all be incremental. But I certainly would not argue with your point that expenses have been a risk factor throughout the year relative to where we started the year.","Adam Beatty - Bank of America","Thanks Mike. I appreciate it.","Operator","And your last question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Thank you. Good morning guys. Mike can you share with us the duration of the bond portfolio extended out slightly this quarter to 2.1 years. What's your comfort level, how far out would you consider going?","Mike Bell","Sure Gerard. Well first of all, I think it's important to understand that there has been no change at our philosophy or overall approach to interest rate risk in this quarter. You are right that the duration of the portfolio increased modestly. But importantly, please realize as well that our central bank deposits increased significantly in the quarter as well. So, we ended up on average for the quarter with central bank deposits of $53 billion.","So, when I think about the duration of the asset side of our balance sheet, I look at it as a combination of the investment portfolio with as you said, the duration of a shade over two and the central bank deposits, which have a duration obviously of zero.","And as part of the LCR compliance, we've had increase our HQLA revenues significantly. We've done that through an increase in central bank deposits, but also an increase in U.S. treasuries. Weighted together, I don't view it as a material change relative to Q2 or Q3. And certainly there has not been a change in philosophy.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Great. And then second, can you remind us; you touched a little bit on earlier in the call that you\u2019d benefit obviously from a rise in short-term rates and if the curve flattened initially, that would be positive. If we were to get a 100 basis-point rise and rates, what kind of favorable impact in net interest revenue would that be?","Mike Bell","Yes. Gerard, I think that\u2019s a difficult one, because it will depend upon a number of different factors, not the least of which is whether the excess deposits that we have the $40 billion of excess deposits that we had in Q3 stick around or not. We do put some sensitivities out in the 10-Q. Again those based on static client behavior. And again our own thinking Gerard is that if we did see, certainly if we saw 100 basis-point increase in short-term rates, we believe that the vast bulk if not all of the $48 billion would likely find the home somewhere else.","So I think it\u2019d be difficult to try to quantify that. I think the way -- I\u2019d say how I think about it, I think about it as if we get a 25 basis-point increase in rates, particularly short-term rates, I think we will get a benefit on the asset side of the equation, particularly the half of the portfolio that is affording rate portfolio, we\u2019d expect this would get the bulk of the 25 basis-point benefit on that half. On the half that\u2019s fixed investment rate will get that over time as the portfolio rolls over. And with rates of essentially forward in so many jurisdictions, we wouldn\u2019t expect much move in the liability side.","And then as we\u2019ve talked about the second 25 basis points, it\u2019s a little more shared between us in our clients and then it\u2019s different beyond that. But overall, I would characterize this as a net item, but not one that I would try to quantify at this point beyond what we put out in the Q.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Great, thank you very much.","Jay Hooley","Stephanie, I want to thank you and thank everybody else for joining us today on the call. And we look forward to speaking with you again at the end of the fourth quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

The only authorized broadcast of this call will be housed on the State Street\u2019s website.","Now, I would like to introduce Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Global Head of Investor Relations at State Street.","Ilene Fiszel Bieler","Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley will speak first, then Eric Aboaf, our CFO will take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to two questions and then re-queue.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one-on-one items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our slide presentation.","In addition, today\u2019s presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.","With that, let me turn it over to Ron.","Ron O'Hanley","Good morning, everyone. As you know, this is my first opportunity to address you since becoming State Street\u2019s CEO at the start of 2019. ","Let me turn to slide 3. We announced our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results this morning and I want to start by providing some context in terms of the overall environment, addressing our performance and then importantly, focus the bulk of my comments outlining what we\u2019re going to do differently going forward. Market dynamics are changing for our clients. The shift from active to passive means thinner fees as well as more competition amongst managers who are increasingly challenged to outperform their peers and consequently face lower volumes and thinner fees themselves. ","The resulting margin compression for investment managers has led them to increase pressure on their providers. Asset owners, facing inadequate returns, are similarly pressuring providers to do more for less. In turn, these same clients need better technology and streamlined operations to increase their ability to generate alpha more efficiently and reduce operating costs. ","Given these headwinds for our clients, we are adapting strategically to become increasingly more competitive, offer greater functionality and be the essential partner to our clients. I have made it clear to my colleagues at State Street and want to make it clear to you, we want to better drive our own destiny and more effectively manage our exposure to market headwinds. That means change, real change that I will talk about today and in the year ahead. Year-over-year, our revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven by strong performance in net interest income and FX trading as well as the contribution from the recently acquired Charles River development business. ","We are encouraged by the continued interest we are seeing in CRD with a total of 98 client engagements since announcing the deal. These positive trends were offset by unfavorable market conditions, including the significantly down markets during the fourth quarter and ongoing fee compression, which impacted our servicing fee revenues. Assets under custody and administration decreased quarter-over-quarter, reflecting lower equity market levels and client transitions. Fourth quarter new servicing business wins were 140 billion. ","Additionally, at quarter end, AUCA yet to be installed totaled approximately 385 billion. At 1.9 trillion for the full year of 2018, we experienced a record level of new servicing wins. State Street Global Advisors was also impacted by the market environment as our business has a disproportionate exposure to equity markets and other risk on asset classes, such as high yield. Assets under management decreased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by weaker equity markets as well as institutional and cash outflows, partially offset by ETF net inflows. ","While SSGA results are not yet where we would like them to be, we have been working to diversify our business mix, leverage relationships across State Street and fill in offerings as we take advantage of the shift from products to solutions. These offerings include asset allocation, exposure management and outsourced CIO as well as demand for a range of ETF products. For example, this quarter, we saw good organic growth in our European ETFs and our low cost US ETFs and remain confident that our strategy of targeted growth in areas such as ETFs, OCIO and other multi asset solutions and ESG, just to name a few, will drive future growth.","Regarding our overall bottom line performance simply put, we need to and can do better. That means reigniting servicing fee growth in a sustainable way, reducing costs across our organization and building upon the advances that we have made in digitization and automation. Collectively, this means being faster and smarter about how we deliver solutions that solve our client's greatest challenges. Our capital position is strong. Moreover, we are optimistic the balance sheet repositioning actions completed during 2018 better position us for the 2019 CCAR cycle, supporting stronger levels of capital return for our shareholders.","In light of our recent results and ongoing industry dynamics, we are taking immediate action on expenses to ensure that we become a more efficient organization for our clients and shareholders alike. I have implemented a firm wide hiring freeze for all non-critical roles. We are rolling out a rigorous new performance management system and are structurally compressing and reducing the senior management pyramid by 15%, while improving spans and reducing layers across the bank by 25% to create a more agile and accountable organization. ","These actions are enabled by the beacon work and the consolidation of work into our global hubs. Thus, we are confident in our ability to execute quickly. In fact, initial reductions have already occurred. Additionally, we are focused on addressing inefficiencies across our entire expense base and have launched a new cost savings program that will continue through 2019 to reduce structural expenses, while also enabling us to invest in the business appropriately. As part of that program, which Eric will cover shortly, we recorded a 223 million pretax repositioning charge, the benefits from which we expect to fully realize within 12 to 15 months.","Let me turn to slide 4. Slide 4 outlines my vision for State Street. We intend to be the leading asset servicer, asset manager and data insight provider to the owners and managers of the world\u2019s capital. This vision will be driven by five strategic priorities. ","One, we will increase core fee growth by becoming an essential partner to our clients, gaining share of wallet and building enduring institutional relationships. The issues faced by our clients have moved services, technology and operations to the C suite agenda. Thus, we are upgrading our client coverage model to meet these needs. These changes, including new senior leadership, are already underway.","Two, we must deploy the industry's leading front to back asset servicing platform as a technology driven scale provider. Three, we will continue to innovate to grow diversified revenue streams, including new markets and NII opportunities. Four, we must generate structural expense saves by automating key processes to reduce unit costs and by leveraging our global hubs and scale among other initiatives. And five, become a more high performing organization through flattening our structure, increasing the speed of decision making and evolving our employees\u2019 skill base around our technology and data priorities.","Executing against the strategic vision will require concerted action and select investments, which I'm driving forward across the business. At the same time, we need to do more to improve performance in the short term, which is evidenced by our actions announced today.","And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.","Eric Aboaf","Thank you, Ron and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and 2018 results, I'd like to take a moment on slide 5 to discuss notable items and how they impacted our financials. In 4Q 18, we recognized 223 million of pretax repositioning costs, consisting of severance and real estate write offs. This charge is in response to the challenging industry conditions and includes the organizational streamlining and de-layering actions that Ron announced last month. I'll have more to say on how we are tackling expenses later in the presentation, including details in our new 350 million expense initiative announced today.","In addition, we also had 24 million of acquisition restructuring costs related primarily to Charles River, which was below our original estimate, 24 million related to the sale of a small alternative servicing business in the Channel Islands and 50 million of legal and related costs. In total, we recognized notable items of 321 million pretax or $0.64 a share.","On page 6, we show our GAAP results in the top two panels as well as our results ex the notable items I just described for those of you who want to see some of our underlying trends. On this basis, we didn't achieve our fee operating leverage goal, but we did deliver a positive operating leverage overall in 2018.","Now, moving to slide 7, 4Q18 EPS of $1.04 was down 44% quarter-on-quarter, but up 17% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of our 4Q18 repositioning charge and the 4Q17 tax reform costs. For the full year 2018, our GAAP EPS of $6.40 was up 22% over 2017.","Looking at 4Q18, return on equity was down 6.5 percentage points sequentially, primarily related to the quarter's notable expense items. For the full year 2018, ROE was up 1.6 percentage points from full year 2017. Overall, we saw growth in both EPS and ROE on a full year basis, driven by NII growth through active balance sheet management and higher interest rates, FX trading, where we continue to gain share, the acquisition of CRD and lower taxes. We are however disappointed by our performance in several of our fee businesses and I'll describe the drivers and our additional actions on the next few pages. ","Turning to slide 8, our end of period AUCA and AUM levels were significantly impacted by the sharp sell-off in equity markets during the end of the fourth quarter as well as the cumulative effect of industry flows in the past year. As you know and as we have summarized on the right side of this page, global equity markets were down 6% to 17% in 2018, after posting double digit gains in 2017. At the same time, cumulative industry flows were dramatically down after significant inflows during last year and client transaction activity was muted, as investors sat on the sidelines. As a result, we saw AUCA levels fall 7% quarter-on-quarter and 5% year-on-year, while AUM levels fell 11% and 10% respectively.","Moving to slide 9, I want to spend some time unpacking total revenues, which were up 1% quarter-on-quarter and up 5% year-on-year. Servicing fees, shown in the dark blue piece of the stacked bar on the left side of the page were down 4% quarter-on-quarter and 7% year-on-year. Let me give you some color. On both the sequential quarter and year-over-year basis, we had a 2 to 3 point reduction in servicing fees due to falling global equity markets. In addition, we've recently been seeing industry pricing pressure of about 1 percentage point per quarter over the last year. ","The cumulative effect has caused a material year-on-year downdraft in servicing fees. And we also had one previously disclosed client transition, which was worth about 2 percentage points year-on-year, which was offset by net new business and client activity. To put these numbers in context, the long term appreciation in equity markets has typically lifted servicing fees on average by about 2 percentage points annually over the last 5 years. Positive client flows and client transactional activity have added another 2 percentage points annually and net new business has also generated 2 percentage points of annual growth, all of which have been partially offset by typical pricing headwinds of just under 2 percentage points annually. ","This year has been particularly challenging though, since we've seen twice the average historical pricing headwinds. Without the tailwind of market appreciation nor client flows and activity that are inherent in our pricing structure. We have thus undertaken meaningful initiatives to combat these headwinds, such as upgrading our client coverage program and strengthening pricing discipline through our new pricing governance process. And since we need to focus on what we can control, we are even more resolute that we need to actively manage our expense base lower, which I'll discuss further in a few minutes.","Turning to slide 10, let me briefly discuss our other fee revenues. Beginning with management fees, 4Q revenue was up 5% year-on-year, primarily driven by revenue recognition adoption, but down 7% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower equity markets as well as net outflows in our equity focused institutional business. SSGA continues to focus on expanding our relationships and product categories that offer higher margin. 4Q FX trading services saw continued strong performance, up 19% year-over-year, driven by higher FX volumes and volatility. We continue to differentiate our FX offerings with clients, driven by the breadth and depth of our capabilities. ","4Q securities finance revenues were down 6% quarter-on-quarter and 18% year-on-year, reflecting lower assets on loan and lower spreads as clients de-leverage and industry demand fell. I would note that the business continues to evolve after the CCAR related counterparty adjustments. We've navigated these changes quite smoothly in FX, but continue to work through the effects in agency lending. Finally, we saw a significant step up in processing fees with the addition of CRD for the first time in our fourth quarter financials. We continue to be excited by the acquisition, we're pleased with its performance and remain confident in our previously announced revenue and cost synergies.","As you can see, on the lower right of the slide, CRD saw net new bookings of 14 million for 4Q18. We have announcer our new client advisory board and delivered higher than expected fourth quarter revenues of 121 million on 39 million of expenses. We also incurred 18 million of amortization costs and 24 million of acquisition costs associated with CRD this past quarter. While CRD is enjoying real momentum, I would caution you against simply annualizing these 4Q results, given the lumpiness inherent in the 606 revenue accounting reporting standard.","Now on to slide 11, we saw continued NII growth and NIM expansion during the fourth quarter. Our NII was up 4% quarter-on-quarter due to the Fed hikes we saw in September and December as well as a one-time benefit of approximately 6 million from hedging activities. 4Q NII was up 13% year-on-year, driven by higher US interest rates and discipline liability pricing, while NIM expanded 7 basis points quarter-on-quarter and 17 basis points year-on-year. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our average level deposits remained fairly steady and our betas remained similar to last quarter at just over 50%. We were also pleased to see an increase in our lending activity during the quarter. All of this bodes well for a full year 2019.","Now turning to expenses, as we indicated earlier in the call, we are extraordinarily focused on managing expenses in this challenging revenue environment. I'll start by summarizing our expenses on an underlying basis, excluding notable items in Charles River and then discuss our efforts during 3Q and 4Q to keep our second half expenses flat to the first half on that basis. I'll then summarize the new expense savings program we just announced today.","Beginning on slide 12, you can see that our underlying basis 4Q18 expenses were up 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, driven largely by the year-over-year adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard as well as technology investments. From a line item perspective, and relative to 4Q17, comp and employee benefits were well controlled, increasing just 1%, reflecting technology contractor and annual merit increases, partially offset by beacon savings and lower performance based incentive compensation, given our disappointing results.","Information systems increased reflecting infrastructure enhancements as well as additional investments to support growth. Transaction processing costs were down as we renegotiated sub-custodian savings for a second quarter in a row. Occupancy costs were down as a result of continued progress in optimizing our global footprint.","Now turning the slide 13, as the extent of the challenging revenue conditions became clear last spring, we committed to actually managing our quarterly expenses, so as to keep second half expenses flat to first half on an underlying basis. As you see on the left side of this page, we deliver on this commitment, but we know we need to do more. On the right side of the page, we summarize the progress in our Beacon savings, which totaled 245 million in 2018 as well as additional tactical actions and savings, which included a down payment on our 2019 program. These savings include the start of management de-layering, contracts under savings, the renegotiation of certain sub-custodial relationships and better control of discretionary spending.","Now to slide 14, in light of our current macroeconomic and industry conditions impacting revenues, we have launched a significant new expense savings program. In total, this program is designed to achieve 350 million of in year expense savings during 2019 or approximately 4% of our expense base, which is larger than our previous efforts. On the right side of the page, you'll see the two major categories we've identified, resource discipline and process engineering and automation, with expected savings of approximately 160 million and 190 million respectively.","Resource discipline includes a previously announced 15% reduction in senior management, the rollout of a more rigorous performance management system to better control headcount and further vendor management savings and the continued tackling of our real estate footprint. Process engineering and automation benefits are expected to include the reduction of approximately 6% of our workforce or 1500 roles in high cost locations. Staffing assessments were recently done as part of our shift to a more globalized model and we are now able to take further advantage of automation, and standardized processes and lower cost per person. ","We also intend to streamline three operational hubs and two joint ventures as well as continue the drive towards common technology platforms and the retirement of legacy applications. The initiation of certain portions of this program results in the 4Q repositioning charge that I mentioned, which we described in the left side of the page. Even though this charge is good payback, we know we need to reduce the size of these charges going forward, which is why we've rolled out a new performance management system and headcount control.","Moving to slide 15, our capital ratios ended the year, similar to those of a year ago with tier 1 leverage of 7.2% and a standardized set 1 of 11.5%. We also undertook certain balance sheet and counterparty actions in the fourth quarter to be better positioned for the 2019 CCAR process. As you see on the left side of the page, we shifted the investment portfolio during 4Q to further increase the percentage of HQLA securities and adjusted the held to maturity holdings, thus reducing the associated AOCI volatility to our capital under stress.","This portfolio rebalancing, including turning over about 10% of the book and is not expected to have a negative impact on further NII growth. Lastly and consistent with our previous announcement, we will resume share repurchases this month and intend to repurchase up to 600 million through June 30, 2019.","Turning now to slide 16, I'd like to focus on our 2019 outlook. Before I start though, I'd like to first share some of the assumptions, underlying our current views. At a macro level, we are assuming continued, albeit slowing global growth. Market interest rates forward and only ","a modest uplift from equity markets, but with continued volatility, which will keep investor flows muted and transactional activity light.","I would note that this operating environment is materially worse today than it was just 45 days ago when I presented at the Goldman Conference. Since then, we've seen a significant selloff in equity markets for the year end 2018 with the US equity indices down almost 10% in December versus the first two months of the fourth quarter. This sell off has put a material drag on our quarterly fee revenue run rate since it is geared off of the 2018 year end step off of AUCA and AUM levels. And over the same period, the rates picture has markedly changed too, with the consensus moving from two Fed hikes in 2019 to nearly none.","Amidst this uncertain revenue environment, we will be laser focused on expenses. As you can see in the walk, we believe we can achieve approximately 4% in productivity saves, driven by our larger than usual 2019 expense program, which includes both resource discipline and process re-engineering improvements, partially offset by an approximately 3% of ongoing business and necessary IT investments. This should yield a net 1% reduction in 2019 total underlying cost, aside from the full year effect of CRD and notable items.","In addition, given the severe market environment, we currently expect to reduce expenses 2 percentage points from 4Q18 to 1Q19, excluding seasonally deferred compensation via our recent hiring freeze and senior management exits. While material percentage of our revenues informed by markets and not in our control, we can control expenses. We will intervene further if necessary.","Turning to fee revenue, with the December market selloff and increased volatility, there is a scenario where 1Q19 total fee revenue could be down quarter-on-quarter by 3 to 4 percentage points, driven by known factors including the market step off, the higher than historical pricing headwinds and the fiscal effects of lumpy revenues in CRD and trading. And because of the year end 2018 step off, even with a modest linear uptick in equity markets during 2019, we could see this 1Q fee revenue as our quarterly run rate for several quarters.","At this point, we\u2019re operating the company under this scenario and we see sustained market uplift or further retreat, however, this picture could change. For example, in terms of market sensitivity, a 5 percentage point instantaneous uplift in markets is worth about 25 million per quarter to our servicing fee revenue with a lag of half a quarter. In regards to NII, we expect to see low to mid-single digit growth for the year. For 1Q, we expect a downtick, which would be fully accounted for by two fewer days and the absence of the 4Q episodic hedging benefits I mentioned earlier. Taxes should be in the 15% to 16% range for the year, though we expect 1Q19 to be higher at 18%. And finally, given the balance sheet repositioning undertaken in the fourth quarter, we are optimistic that we are better positioned for the 2019 CCAR process, subject of course to the Federal Reserve scenarios and associated approvals. Depending upon the specific CCAR scenarios, we would expect to target a total payout of over 80% for the upcoming CCAR cycle.","Finally to slide 17, in summary, full year 2018 was a mixed year. We had a solid start to the year with record new servicing wins of 1.9 trillion, which reflects our distinct servicing capabilities. Revenues started strong, but we had a difficult second half, given our exposure to weaker equity markets and challenging industry conditions. We continue to distinguish ourselves in FX trading as well as how we've effectively driven NII growth, as we've engaged with clients. All told, EPS increased 22% and ROE increased 1.6 percentage points. On the capital front, we are better positioned for the 2019 CCAR cycle and one of our top priorities is to return substantial capital to shareholders this year.","Finally, as I outlined a few moments ago, we are taking immediate action to adjust our expense base for this new revenue environment and we're confident the actions we announced today position us well to reduce our 2019 underlying expense base, relative to last year.","And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.","Ron O'Hanley","Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","Further comment on the pricing, because I think we all get that the market drops and so fee start out lower. That's, I don't think a surprise at this point. The worst pricing, what I'm curious about is, how it manifests itself, in other words, I think you used the phrase this year, I mean, this year is like 2 weeks old. So are we talking about each new contract that comes up as it comes up and it kind of rolls over like the next five years, I just wanted to get -- understand a little bit more about what's new about the -- because pricing has gone down like the last 30 years straight?","Ron O'Hanley","This is Ron. Let me start on that and then Eric will probably want to say something on it. The way pricing works in there or historically has worked in this business and particularly for us since our business is disproportionately for asset managers is that when you reprice, there are some assumptions built in around market and as importantly around flows. I mean, if you serve asset managers, you get the business and then over time it accumulates. We've gone through -- the industry has gone through a very large number of repricings for all the reasons that I've outlined earlier in terms of the pressure that clients are under and those same assumptions, at least on our part have been applied and I assume on everybody else\u2019s part. ","We had a year of very sharp down market and as importantly no flows. So between the volume of pricing and the fact that the usual kind of assumptions haven't yet played out, that's what's led to one, our results, particularly towards the latter half of 2018 and second for our outlook. Now, it's obviously -- we have to, as part of the pricing discipline that we've talked about, we\u2019re rethinking these assumptions in terms of market and how much, if at all, to rely on flows, but that's really what we're referring to here.","Do you want to add anything?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. Glenn, I\u2019ll just add that historically we've seen pricing headwinds for decades in this business, just part of the underlying assumptions or some pricing headwinds offset by flows and activity and market appreciation, as well the structure the contracts are set up and those have historically been in the 1.5% to 2% range. Literally, over the last half decade, we've gone back a decade and we've got that history. We've seen closer to 4% headwinds this year. ","And if we think about the coming year, we expect about the same. That said, we've been renegotiating our contracts, right, and extending term. We've been putting in place some clarity around expectations on volumes and market levels and so forth. And while we're a bit more than halfway through those contract negotiations, the negotiations happen, then the fee changes occur and then we actually have to live through that. So we're just a bit below the majority of what we are going to need to live through and that's just part of what we have to navigate. ","I will say that the fee headwinds tend to hit a little more in the earlier part of the year than the latter part, just because of the kind of calendarization. And so that's incorporated in our forecast. The net is that, at the end of the day, this is part of our industry. We feel like this is a wave, it's a larger wave than we've seen in the past and -- than usual \u2013 and we think there will be some reversion to the mean. But that said, it strengthens our resolve that we've got to work on expenses. We've got to take expenses out, we've got improved productivity and we've got to adjust our cost structure to be in line with what the revenues are that we can earn.","Glenn Schorr","That actually leads to just my other follow-up is, if you could talk about the timing and ramping of, say, both the cost save program, because it's more headcount than comp focused and then also, while we're at it, the timing and ramping of the one, but not yet funded pipeline, because those could be partial offsets as well obviously.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. Let me start on the expense side, because that's, I've been putting a lot of my time personally with Ron and the management team on that and I think you saw in my prepared remarks, I gave you a sense of what we expect to do in terms of expenses for the year on an underlying basis, down 1% and because we've been intervening month by month and quarter by quarter, we expect total expense to be down on an underlying basis by about 2 percentage points from 4Q to 1Q. But we're trying to just adjust and that just comes in stepwise the increments. ","I think at the same time, there are some ramping of some of the ongoing investments that we need to do and so that's what -- that's what will get the lines to meet at about that 1% down for the year. But, we're trying to peel off expenses, we've got a relatively fixed cost base, so we've got to take it down in steps and at the same time, we got to do it carefully, so that we continue to serve our clients well and deliver the services in the highest quality manner.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hey, Eric, I was wondering if you could help us flush out the point you made about not run rating CRD? And can you help us understand just what your expected contribution would be, if possible, both on the revenue side for more of a full year \u201819 basis and also on the cost side? I think what you've given us is the underlying on the expense, but it would be helpful if you could give us a sense of how you're thinking about the CRD adds? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Sure. Let me describe CRD in a little more detail and I think we provided the fourth quarter P&L here on page 10 of the materials. Think about it this way, revenues have a seasonality in CRD, because of the kind of natural calendarization that happens in sales, in a software oriented business and I think you'll see that in most of the software business that you or some of your colleagues may cover. We disclosed that we -- that the fourth quarter is typically 30% to 35% of full year revenues, that's a rough amount. It will vary a bit, but that's probably at least something to start with and so part of the guidance I gave on total fees for 4Q to 1Q includes the natural downtick that you\u2019d see after that fourth quarter seasonal position. And I think you can kind of build models off of that.","In terms of expenses, these are first quarterly expenses, what we are doing in CRD is all the things you'd expect and we've described, right, we're tackling those 80 or 90 engagement -- client engagements. We've begun to build out the sales force further that was part of our intention. We've added and we're adding product engineers for installation, because that tends to be the bottleneck, not just sales, but actually the ability to install and to install in a timely manner. So the expenses for CRD will ramp during the year as we integrate. That's all part of the accretion dilution analysis that -- and commitments we made.","And so I think you've got to assume some ramp that would be representative of what you might do, were you to run a software company, where you are trying to effectively double the revenue growth rate, because that is the underlying goal. Remember, the original -- the growth rate in this business historically over the last four or five years has been about 7% top line. The kind of on Charles River synergies should take that through a series of different actions to double that and so we need to invest in the earlier quarters and years to deliver on that.","Ken Usdin","And then if I just take that back up to the top of the house, I think the comments you gave us on the fees were on an all-inclusive basis, so if I think about what you just added on the CRD, what's your concept of just -- and I know it's harder, given your opening comments, but just the ability to deliver positive operating leverage and given the tougher market environment and some of the pricing points and how are you going to -- how you're trying to balance that, can you do positive fee operating leverage with this outlook or is it just going to be one of those, hey, we've got to make it through this and then the longer term, we come back to it as the market improves?","Eric Aboaf","Ken, it's more the latter to be honest, right. I've been real clear about the change in the market environment just over the last month and a half, right, whether it's equity market levels, whether it's even lower flows, I think, December long term outflows between US and Europe were, just in December were $100 billion negative. Through November of the year, they weren't even $200 billion negative. So this -- and then we have all the geopolitical and macroeconomic and trade questions. And so that makes us feel that we should be conservative and careful in how we run the company. And as a result, I think what we've done here as part of our prepared remarks is be real clear about what we can do and should be doing on expenses. We are -- we think there's a ranges, I think there's a range of scenarios on revenues and what I'd rather do is just give you good visibility into the coming quarter or quarters on revenue as I get that and then a real commitment on the expenses and just be in touch as developments change.","Ron O'Hanley","Ken, what I would add to that is that we believe we need to manage the company with this somewhat muted outlook. There's so much uncertainty out there in terms of the macro environment, what it means for markets and what it means for investor flows. Having said that, we continue to be very encouraged by the client activity that we see, some of it Charles River driven, some of it driven simply by our increase in service quality and the drive for clients to think about more consolidation, but we really do understand that those macro effects can actually overwhelm anything that we might do and then I am actually confident we will do on the revenue side, so it makes sense for us to manage the company on the expense basis with that muted outlook.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Just want to try to think about this in the context of the medium term targets that you guys laid out in early December. I believe the targets included a 10% to 15% GAAP EPS and it was my understanding that that was the one medium term metric that actually intended to apply for each year, it would apply to actually 2019. So number one, now that we know what GAAP EPS for \u201818 is at 6.40, I want to make sure that that is still intact and then maybe help me understand how to get there, because to think about adding in CRD operating expenses of 160 and amortization and such to the expense guide that you give in the deck, with net of the cuts you\u2019re making and then also layering in, Eric, your reference to some sustained fee rate pressure, which seems like we had stability in 4Q, but maybe you're indicating that that was -- that's temporary and we should think about some further fee rate pressure from here, so maybe, I might not be thinking about correctly, hopefully you can provide some clarity? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Brennan, it's Eric. Let me take that. We made some very clear commitments for the medium term across a series of different financial elements from capital return to reigniting revenue growth, EPS and so forth. I thinks in the last month and a half, as I said in my prepared remarks, the environment has really changed for this year 2019 and whether it's the equity markets off 10%, whether it's long term flows racking, one of the worst months of the last few years, whether it's a geopolitical and economic environment, getting -- taking another step down or sideways, we now think there is a wider range of revenue scenarios than I think we consciously had in mind in early December, as we put up those medium term targets a bit. ","So I think from my perspective is we are going to hold to the medium term targets, I think the 2019 year itself is going to be a more challenging one. And at this point, what I\u2019d not like to do is be too optimistic. I think a year ago, in this call, we were a bit too optimistic, as the environment changed and didn't react quickly enough and I think our perspective is, we've got to take a more conservative perspective here and update you as it comes, but I think 2019 will be more challenging than we had expected just a couple of months ago.","Brennan Hawken","Good to know that my math isn't totally way off. And then thinking about the deposit cost front for my follow up. You guys continued to show a 50% beta, which is encouraging. Looks like the likelihood of a further rate hike has deteriorated. So, can you walk us through maybe how we should think about deposit cost pressure and your expectations for deposit costs in a 2019, where we don't see further increases in short term rates, could we still continue to see upward pressure on that deposit cost and what are your expectations there.","Eric Aboaf","Sure, Brennan. Deposit costs and betas will continue to float upwards. I think we've been, 2 years ago, early on, we were in the 20% range for beta as we moved into the 30% to 35% range for a while. This year, we\u2019re right smack in the middle of the 50%, 55% range and we certainly expect that during the year that will continue to tick up and we've seen that in other firms and so that's inherent in our forecast. We think it will jump up to very, very high levels, not, we don't have any indication that that would be the case and so we just expect to continue grind up our betas and continued modest transition from non-interest bearing into interest bearing. ","I think one of the things that gives us confidence in the NII outlook of low single digits to mid-single digits is that, just by virtue of the 4Q step off, right, we build off of that during the course of the year, as we've expanded our coverage program, one of the earliest efforts that Ron and I started, I'd say it was probably about a year ago was actually client engagement on deposits, right, the full suite of what they need to do with their cash and that in our minds has actually really solidified the deposit gathering with our clients and gives us some capability to put the right amount of volume of deposits on our balance sheet. ","And so what we would like to do this year and obviously subject to ebbs and flows in the market is to not only hold deposits steady, but see if we can drive them up somewhat because that would be part of how we deploy the balance sheet in a positive way. And if we can do that plus get some of that high quality lending that the 40x leverage fund needs or the private equity capital call lending that they need, that would also be a positive. So, there are a couple of different dimensions there that we're working on to drive some growth in this coming year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","So I was hoping we can double click on some of the things we talked about here in more detail. So I guess starting with fee pressure, I guess, one, I guess what gives you guys confidence that the pressure will normalize beyond 2019, so sort of why doesn't the 4% annual drag doesn't continue beyond that period? And if you guys could provide a little bit of color in terms of customer segments in particular, client types, geographies, things like that to help us get a better flavor of where the pain points are?","Ron O'Hanley","Alex, this is Ron. I think that where I begin on that is that the -- much of the pricing discussions have occurred and started in earnest with the combination of the ongoing pressure on the big active managers or managers in general, but certainly the big active managers, while at the same time, markets were running up and clients were seeing that State Street and [indiscernible] gathering more revenues for doing really the same things. So it led to what we would view as an accelerated amount and a heightened amount of fee discussions. As Eric outlined though, as we've gone into this period, one, we've moved and pretty much insisted upon term for our pricing. ","So in other words, to make it a little less variable than it's been in the past and second, in most cases, we\u2019ve actually gathered more business as part of the pricing discussion. So the reason why we feel confident that it will abate, it's never going to go away, but that it will abate is, one, as Eric noted I think, we're through about, just over 50% of our clients in terms of discussions on this. A little bit more than that and for the ones that we've done it, we've extended term and gotten more business. So that's why we would feel that this is a bit of a cyclical low here, but feel confident that it should improve.","Eric Aboaf","Alex, it\u2019s Eric. I\u2019d just also say that this is obviously a phenomenon that started in the US, the US asset managers were under more pressure sooner and earlier, right, because of the flows of active to passive. We've had now similar discussions in Europe. There we think it's not to be quite as difficult, partly because the kind of the ETF mutual fund differential isn't as sizable, but we'll see. So it's affecting primarily the asset managers as a segment that\u2019s seeing where those are most intense and a little less so some of the other pension or in insurance type companies. That said, we have had run ups in the marketplace and oftentimes, these fee negotiations become more intense after run ups in the marketplace. ","Why? Because if you just think about yourself being an asset manager, right, you're paying us fees that are scaled to market levels, markets appreciate, you look at your bill, your bill is going up and your natural inclination will be, well, let me go and talk to my bill provider about how can I get some of that back. And so we have seen, as we've gone back for half a decade, a decade or more, some connection between run up in markets followed by more severe adjustments in pricing. And so I think if we get some normalization to kind of more steady growth in markets, we think we'll get some reversion of the mean, whether this 4% level goes back to the 1.5% to 2%, we'll see, whether it goes back to somewhere between them, we'll see and obviously as we see more, we'll share more with you.","Alex Blostein","And then my second question was around securities lending, looking at $120 million run rate this quarter, can you help break out what's kind of still enhanced custody versus traditional agency model and again assuming environment stays roughly the same, is this sort of the low at 120 run rate or you guys are still working through how to reposition the enhanced custody business for CCAR? I thought you said earlier in the call that that\u2019s still a bit ongoing, so I'm just trying to get a better sense of what the jumping off point is?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. At this point, the revenues in securities lending are, let\u2019s see, about 120 for the quarter. It's roughly 60-40, 55-45, classic agency lending versus enhanced custody. So it's kind of in that \u2013 and in that range. I think there are two things going on right now in this area and it's really around the agency area. I think we've seen some stability, reasonable stability in enhanced custody. But on the classic agency lending, we've seen some real market, with markets levels falling, you have just assets on -- loans are lower. We've seen de-leveraging by some of the hedge funds who need to borrow. ","So there's less demand out there and as a result, spreads have come down as well. And I think the question is, what happens, one question is what happens to market levels and demand in first quarter. And if you remember, we ended December, I think, at close to 10% below S&P levels for October-November. We've had a little bit of a bounce back, but if that persists, we're still likely to have a lower average, highly likely to have a lower average first quarter than fourth quarter and so that's going to create some dampening measures on demand and you still have some hedge funds continue to de-leverage. So there's clearly a market demand element here that makes us feel careful about the 4Q to 1Q and is embedded in my sequential fee guidance. ","I think the other part is the counterparty work that we've had to do with CCAR does have more of an effect on sec lending and while I think we've been through most of it, I don't think we've been through all of it in the agency space, which is kind of just a little more than half of sec lending. In FX, I think we've done a terrific job in diversifying counter parties, innovating, doing compression trades, right, the tools are quite vast and the number of counter parties out there are quite significant and the team has really turned on a dime to kind of adjust their processes. ","In agency lending, it's much more concentrated business. There is fewer kind of transaction types available to us and so it's something we're working through and need a little bit of time on. That said, I would tell you agency lending and securities lending and enhanced custody continue to be an area of innovation for us. The question is, how can you structure trades in various approaches to actually refine and actually connect counter parties as opposed to always be the intermediary and still earn a fee and effectively add innovation in what's been a historically unchanged marketplace. So more to come on that and we'll certainly talk more over the coming quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Eric, just to follow up on that. Could you give us a sense of, if you ran through your new positioning on last year CCAR, how much it would have changed the results?","Ron O'Hanley","I\u2019m chuckling Betsy because that's the question we \u2013 our capital team would like to ask the Fed, right, that's the -- how do the models work. I'd tell you this that on the investment portfolio we and I think the other large banks have done quite a bit of work on the mark to market effect and how the mark to market on the OCI positions could be modeled and we've now got 5, 6, I think we've got 6 or more data points, their data points with changing portfolios. ","So, how much is it worth, I think we've got a range of estimates. I think the reason we felt comfortable saying that we're optimistic about our capital position is if you think about it, if we have earnings of what it's been the 2.5 billion, 3 billion a year, we know how much we like to return and we know what every 10 percentage points of those earnings are in terms of capital return and so if 10 percentage points of capital return at $300 million, right, we have some sense for how much you\u2019d have to adjust the mark to market impact to create another 10 percentage points or 20 percentage points of return and that's kind of the math we've done. So I don't really want to be in a position to predict AOCI impacts on our portfolio. We could all do rough estimates, but that's how we've thought about it and that's maybe the kind of the quantitative context I'd share with you.","Betsy Graseck","And then just separately, the Fed has talked about proposing CCAR stress tests, it's only run on RWAs and not on leverage ratios, have you thought through what that could mean for you.","Ron O'Hanley","Yeah. I think we've done the modeling of that. I think there's been a fair amount of outside in modeling and right now, I think tier 1 leverage is our finding constraint and under the stress test. The difference between a tier 1 leverage binding constraint versus an RWA binding constraint, while it's not perfectly discernable, rough estimates, $1 billion range, maybe a 1.5 billion, but it kind of depends on exactly how the test is run, what the timing is of the various market factors and so forth, but that has some real material benefit and I think we are optimistic that with [indiscernible] having passed and the Fed working on the implementation of that and some of the Vice Chairman\u2019s comments that there is some real movement is just a matter of time and hopefully months, not quarter is when we hear more, but it\u2019s an important positive for us.","Betsy Graseck","And then just a little bigger picture, I know you've talked a bit about, if then scenarios on revenues and expenses and I guess I'm just trying to understand if you have a more muted revenue outlook, Ron, maybe you could just give us a sense as to, do you have to invest to get further cost saves or do you feel like there still is opportunity because I know you did a big restructuring here. And I'm just trying to understand, is further potential expense opportunities really incremental or is there more that you can chop?","Ron O'Hanley","So what we've done is going after the expenses that one we just should go after and second, what we believe we need to go after, given what you're hearing from us is a cautious outlook going forward. If your question is, is there more to go after, of course there is and we've got -- we've noted a comprehensive program in place that we actually expect to be able to drive more. We also have the work that's been done in the past that I can't emphasize enough in terms of Beacon, the work that's underway in terms of consolidating our delivery and all of our operations and those efforts will continue to pay off in 2019 and beyond. And then finally, to the extent to which we saw an environment that was even worse than the cautious one that you're hearing from us, we'd obviously start to look at things like the pattern of investment. I mean, that's the last thing we'll go after because we do believe that it's important. What we have what we think is a sensible investment program, adjusted to the opportunities and market realities, but if we had to, we\u2019d look at that again too.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Maybe I'll just start with expenses and then move on to revenue growth question. So first, just on expenses, just to clarify for 2019. I'm getting basically to about an 8.6 billion core expense run rate and what you exclude from that is the CRD amortization and any CRD acquisition related expenses. But it would also include delivery costs to achieve the revenue synergies that you outlined when you did the deal, which would be some portion of that 180 to 200 and maybe if you can \u2013 Eric, if you can talk about how you're looking at those delivery costs for 2019 and then the trajectory of expenses going into 2020, given that we're potentially guiding down on expenses and saves as the year?","Eric Aboaf","Brian, it's Eric. Let me try to do this from a couple of different directions. I think page 16 of the deck is probably a helpful starting point, because we kind of define the underlying 2018 expenses as you know that\u2019s ex CRD and so forth. And then where we expect those to end at the end of \u201919. I think you do need to take -- put CRD in there. First quarter, scale it up and I think while we will be investing, I'd ask you to think through how quickly can you invest well in a business, right, there's little bit of a bounding limit there and if you're at a $40 million run rate in 4Q, it just -- think about, I think, there's a range, but I think you can quickly come to what's reasonable versus an unreasonable set of expense growth rate off of that level. ","So I think you can work off of that. You do have to factor in the intangible amortization, which we've defined there and then the acquisition and restructuring costs will also flow through. I think this quarter is a good example of what a run rate should be on a quarterly basis, but we\u2019ll obviously take those as they come, in line with the actions we\u2019ve take and the appropriate accounting. So those are the pieces, happy to work with you and IR team to take a look at how you're modeling it out and take things from there.","Brian Bedell","Okay. We\u2019ll do that offline. And then just on the revenue side, maybe Ron, if you could just characterize how those conversations are going, you mentioned the 98 client engagements with Charles River customers and if you could give some perspective, maybe some refresh perspective on the trajectory of revenue synergies, appreciate that that\u2019s a 2021 goal, but if you could sort of give us a sense of how optimistic you are on winning new business from the game plan of talking with the CRD clients and the concept that you mentioned at the outset of the pressure that asset managers are facing and whether they're very receptive to the partnering concept?","Ron O'Hanley","So, let me start with the question on optimism. We're very optimistic about achieving, if not exceeding those revenue synergy goals. The nature of the conversations, let me give you some sense of those. Some of them are simply that the CRD clients, they like the new owner, the new owner is in private equity, so they see stability and there's just more CRD activity happening, more movement from shrink-wrap to cloud, all of which is good from a revenue and profitability perspective from CRD. ","There's also a series of client -- a series of client conversations where it may be a State Street client with no CRD presence or a CRD client that sees the value of having more of their activities with State Street and CRD together and the attraction of those of course is a simplification of the internal operations and operating stack and technology stack. And then there's a set of conversations that we, in all honesty, hadn't expected to be having, which is clients, where we either don't serve them now or we serve them in a minimal way or even in a couple of cases where there was a competitive bidding situation and we lost typically for price that are all being looked at again. So it's pervasive, it's comprehensive and it's driven by all these -- all these things we talk about in the marketplace, which are real negatives to short term revenues, but we think are real positives to seeing more business consolidate with us and us having, in the end, a much higher share of the wallet.","Brian Bedell","And do you think you can -- based on those conversations achieve those revenue synergies in a potentially linear fashion over the next three years or is it more hockey stick towards 20 and 21?","Ron O'Hanley","It's a little bit too early to tell on whether the pattern is going to change, Brian, because these are pretty comprehensive discussions. You try and move them along as fast as you can, but they take time, because you're really talking about a once in a generation change in these firms in terms of how they're going to run their business. So right now, we're sticking to the timeframe, but I would emphasize that we're highly confident in achieving the amount.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Mike Carrier","Good morning, so first question. Just on expenses, I guess I want to kind of step away from the expense program and the 350, but just thinking about sort of the core business, maybe like what has been done to make the cost structure maybe more variable, just given some of the uncertainties that you have on the revenue side, some of the pricing trends that you're seeing and basically, if it's -- the revenue is going to be tough to predict, I'm just trying to gauge, when we think about some of the lines like comp, transaction, other, like how much of that is variable that can kind of ebb and flow with the revenue backdrop versus what's fixed or more structural.","Eric Aboaf","Mike, it's Eric. Let me start on that one because the nature of our business has actually become, in terms of expenses, more fixed than variable and partly that is, as we automate, as we put more capital work and labor and we need to make that shift be even more dramatic to be honest and, I think, as Ron describes, we feel good about some of the investments we've made in some of the automation, but I don't think we've sufficiently adjusted the stack of labor that we have against it, but our business is actually becoming more fixed than variable over time. ","And I think that means two things. I think that means from an expense program and programmatic standpoint, we need to find ways to take out step level, kind of step function expenses off of -- out of our expense base, so as we automate we need to take labor out, as we work with vendors, we need to find ways to adjust downwards, as we get larger and they get larger and we force the scale benefits to accrue to both parties. So that's part of what we just need to do because of the nature of how this business has evolved, relative to where it was as a highly manual, highly variable business, 10, 20, 30 years ago.","I think the second perspective that we've developed as a senior team here is because it's more fixed than variable, we actually need to find ways that in good times, we create more margin expansion and more leverage because in truth, while we have an ability to take some step wise and step function reductions in the expenses, in difficult times, it's hard to adjust the level that we would like, given that revenues could move as much as they are moving up or down. ","And so I think our historic belief that we should run with operating leverage of maybe a point in good times, I think that's not really something that makes sense as we step back and think about how this business has been operated, it may have made sense in the past, but that's something that we need to change. And so we first need to work through this particular market environment, but that gives you at least some context as to how we're thinking about this going forward as well.","Ron O'Hanley","Mike I want to add to Eric's last point there because I think part of the challenge that we're facing now is that in the past, the costs have been too variable, as the business has grown and it's not that there were people have been through it, we had these distributed operations and we just weren't achieving scale benefits as rapidly as we should have, as we could have been. With the work that's been done over the last year, not just Beacon, but this consolidation of our operations into this global delivery group and the creation and running of these hubs, that is the goal is to achieve much better scale benefits and as a consequence, we should be able to deliver what Eric's talking about in terms of in good times, actually more operating leverage than we have in the past.","Mike Carrier","And then just a quick follow up. You guys mentioned some of the pricing challenges across most of the asset servicing or asset management industry versus CNF, but when you think about some of the other products, services that you're offering, where are you seeing the areas where you're not seeing maybe the same level of pressure, there's more maybe growth opportunity that you can allocate resources to?","Eric Aboaf","Mike, it\u2019s Eric. I think the answer to your question really is around the product stack that we offer. If you think about it, custody for example is the most commoditized of our products. Then there's accounting, then there's funded administration, the prospectus creation, then there is middle office, where I think we've actually gotten to be better about how we and smarter about how we price and operate that business. So as you move up the product stack, I think we see and actually more recently with some of the new SEC reporting requirements and so forth, we've seen more pricing power and I think in fact in terms of something like CRD or software, there's actually effectively inflation escalators in contracts because of the nature of that business and of that industry. ","So part of this is kind of where you are in the stack, which actually I think encourages us to continue to pivot and make sure that when we're offering custody, we also do accounting. When we do accounting, we also do administration and so on and so forth. And so that's maybe a little bit of flavor as to where you have strength. I think the other places we have found that where we have clients that are moving in different directions, de-leveraging or what have you and as their books adjust downwards, we have gone back and said, look, we need to adjust pricing accordingly and in particular, in the hedge fund space, that's been an important part of the back and forth. ","And then lastly I\u2019d tell you the other place that we're working through as pricing is not only as we have price discussions we asked for more wallet and more share of wallet in a much more rigorous and disciplined manner and controlled manner, we've \u2013 Ron and I have put in place with some of our most senior folks, very rigorous processes there, but we've also had very active discussions about being paid for in different ways, being paid for with more deposits left with us than with some of the other players and that's been another area where I think we've found some ability to be paid appropriately for the service we provide.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe just a follow up on Eric on your outlook on NII and NIM, if the Fed were to stop, I mean, historically State Street has seen leverage once the Fed stops, as assets reprice and deposit betas typically or deposit repricing has stopped pretty quickly, because you have high deposit betas during rate hikes and then you stop, sounds like, you didn't, I guess, reinforce that view. So has something changed or should we -- how do you think about Fed deposit pricing once the Fed stops and given where your securities portfolio yield is, it\u2019s still well below 2%, 2-year Treasury, should we expect your securities yield to grind a little higher over -- once the Fed stops, so just thoughts on NIM.","Eric Aboaf","Yes. Let me tackle it from a couple of different directions. I think if the Fed stops now, there are a couple ways that we will get some incremental growth in NII. First, just get the fourth quarter run rate over the earlier quarters will create a full year back to \u201819 relative to \u201918, that's the first piece. The second piece, as you described is that the investment portfolio tractor continues to work upwards and that's worth, we continue to have investment coupons higher than those that are falling off, it\u2019s a little more complicated for our book, because we operate not only in the US geography, but also the international geography, but there is more there. I think third, there is a continued mixing of the portfolio. ","We've historically run with a very large kind of a barbell portfolio of credit and treasuries. I think you've seen in some of the changes that we made, the first quarter of \u201818 and then the fourth quarter of \u201918, you've seen we've shifted into more of agency MBS portfolio that gives us some pickup relative to treasuries and then we've also shifted in the foreign sovereigns, it's -- you can see it directly, but out of some of the sovereign versus some of the supers and also and the other types of global government agencies. So we think there is some amount of grind up work. ","And then I think, the final one, which in some ways is most connected to the business is how do we continue engaging with our clients on cash and how do we actually find ways to create better solutions for them on cash, right. And I think that's where, it's not only their cash position, but it\u2019s their needs for repo, whether it's direct repo or FIC repo, it\u2019s their money market sweeps and so forth. And so each one of those is a very engaged conversation, to the extent that we can drive some amount of volume growth, we feel like backing follow the bottom line and that will just, we can just report on as we see developments.","Jim Mitchell","And on the deposit pricing point, do the prices go up still despite no rate hikes?","Eric Aboaf","No. I think you get a little bit of the tail end of December, flowing through the first quarter, but you get some relative stability in deposit pricing I think. I think on a direct basis, I think the question is how much competition is there out there in a flat rate environment, I think what happens is what happens to the competition for deposits in the banking system and while we don't directly compete, there is always some spillover effect and so if we get a situation where lending grows relatively quickly for a time period, back to the 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% range and banks need to fund that lending with deposits and there's more deposit competition, then you can see pricing, then you can see pricing go in the favor of clients and against the favor of the banks. I don't think we see that at this point, but we're always watching carefully.","Jim Mitchell","And then as a follow up question, just on your revenue, fee revenue forecast, can you just for our modeling purposes, help us understand what market levels you're kind of assuming, I see that in the footnote, you talk about 5% growth from December levels, obviously, right now, we\u2019re up 6% to 8% in the US, depending on which index. What are you assuming in your first and second quarters to give us that kind of fee guidance?","Eric Aboaf","At this point, what we've done is, we've started off of the December 31st step off with that for the US and for the international markets as well. I'm a little cautious on a particular quarter, so just that's why I gave some guidance on total fees for 1Q. Because the way our pricing works is some of it's geared to the, literally, the month end. Some of it's geared to daily averages, sometimes it's a 2 point average and so there is a mix and so it was not helpful that you get that December 31st print. ","And I think the other part that's going on here is flows and client activity matter, right. I think in my remarks, I describes that flows, because the natural course of business on flows and remember we get because of the size of our business in the US and in EMEA for asset managers, we get about a third of the inflows that you see in the industry, we get that in our books and records, right, in our custodial counts. But those kinds of flows and then the client activity or that transactional activity is material. That's historically been worth 2 percentage points of growth over the course of annually, right. And right now, we're not seeing much of that at all and so that's another reason why we are quite cautious on the first quarter and we've added a little bit of wording around that as well.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","A quick question on the market sensitivity that you gave, you mentioned that a 5% uplift is 25 million in servicing fees. So I mean, if you put that relative to what the 2018 revenues are, it's about 1% revenue uptick for the 5% uplift in the markets. So last quarter when you gave that, it was 10% and it gives you a 3% increase, so a 30% pull through rate. This quarter, now, it's down to a 20% pull through rate. So when you finish all these renegotiations that you have ongoing, how does the market sensitivity look when all said and done, I mean, do you expect it to be another step down for market sensitivity from here?","Eric Aboaf","Brian, it's Eric. I think we gave relatively consistent guidance, so the historical guidance that we\u2019ve given in our -- is around 10% change in equity markets is worth about 3 percentage points. So on a base of $5 billion of servicing fees, right, that's about $150 million. I think what I said earlier today in my prepared remarks is that 5 percentage points, about 10 is worth about 25 a quarter, but you lose part of that first quarter, so you get a little more than 75, you get call it 85 to 90. So you're kind of within the range of that 10% and 3%, which would give you $150 million. The other part of that is you get a little bit of sensitivity on management fees that you also have to work through, so we can go through that with the offline, but just trying to give kind of some ranges there, so that you could do a little bit of estimation.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Maybe the general assumption is it should be moving lower, as you're trying to fix -- move to more fixed pricing in the asset servicing business.","Eric Aboaf","Well, I think -- just to clarify, what's happened in -- on the cost structure is the cost structure has become more fixed and less variable. That's on the cost side. On the pricing side, I don't think we have really seen shifts at pricing and pricing structures at this point. I mean, at this point, we still have pricing, which has asset levels as the basis, we have some pricing that is around transactional fees and we have some pricing that's fixed, but there's still some real variability baked into our pricing and we don't see that pricing structure as having changed in new contracts that we're negotiating now relative to those that we've had it, it\u2019s for the level pricing has been adjusted downward and what we're trying to do in several different ways is put controls around our internal processes on how those are negotiated, what we get for them, not only in terms of servicing fees and markets and the FX and security lending and deposits, but also who's engaged at what level of seniority in those discussions, because those are in some ways the most important discussions that we should be having at the most senior levels in our counterparties.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And I just want to clarify one thing on that fee guidance, as you had mentioned. I mean, you were talking about AUM and AUC, right, before you gave the guidance, but I mean you were talking about total fee revenues being down 3% to 4% in the first quarter from fourth quarter, correct?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. That's correct and that just includes all of our fee categories. Correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","Hey, Ron. I hear what you're saying, you have a new expense program, merger synergies with Charles River, you're increasing intensity, but here's my question. What assurance can you give that savings will be sustainable and what is your new pretax margin target and before answering, here's what\u2019s in my head. State Street said that it achieved all savings from business ops and IT transformation and almost all the savings from Project Beacon and had a target at the start of the decade to improve the pretax margin from 29% in 2010 to 33%. But over this 8 year period, State Street, not only missed its own pretax margin target, but the pretax margin declined from 29% in 2010 to 28% last year. ","So while the pretax margin got worse over 8 years, State Street took victory laps on earnings calls, from press releases and its proxy and Ron, I know this is predates you, but still this is a question to what extent is the board looking after shareholder interests, to what extent would State Street apply clawbacks to the prior CEO's pay. Jay, a Grade A person, you've always treated me well, you guys have given me access, but at some point, don't you have to look at the business and say, well, actually, the targets were not met, but again the question is, what assurance can you give that the new potential savings are sustainable? Thank you.","Ron O'Hanley","Mike, I'm not going to spend too much time on what happened in the past, but what happened over that decade in terms of regulatory costs and things like that that may or may not have been in the forecasts or presented, but let me talk about going forward and the assurances here. One, there's been a lot of work done and I keep coming back to Beacon, I keep coming back to what we're doing in terms of consolidated operations that we have not realized the full promise from. We need to accelerate that, but this is not something that we're just thinking about, this is actually work that's underway, has been completed and we need to make sure that we realize the benefits from that. ","Two, as we were talking about earlier, the business, as revenues have come on in this firm, costs have gone up almost at the same rate. We have not gotten sufficient scale advantages, because of the work that's been done and frankly because of the way we're going to manage the business going forward, we will capture more scale benefits. Three, the board is very involved in this. We've worked with them on our new performance management and accountability system and there's a very, very close tie, more so than ever between pay and performance. And so we've got incentives aligned across the firm, so I am confident that we will deliver on what we've said here and we need to do that because we understand that firstly, just to be in a position, to be able to service the business that we see coming down the road, we have to achieve all this. Secondly, we recognize that while there are certain things we can control, there's a lot of things we can\u2019t such as markets, such as client flows and things like that, so therefore that's why we need to redouble the efforts around there. So in those periods, like a 2018, that we don't see that same kind of fall off.","Mike Mayo","And just a follow up, again, from covering State Street for a while and again this predates you, a lot of comments about the success of these prior programs, when business ops and IT transformation was first launched, it talked about improving scale and you think you'd see the scale benefits in the pretax margin, so with your more fresh view, do you say what should investors think about State Street for the past decade, given the success of these programs, but then the bottom line not really changing as much, what's your more fresh perspective?","Ron O'Hanley","I point to two things. One is that I don't think that anybody at the beginning of the last decade anticipated the significance of regulatory cost increase and just what that would be. Second, we have been slow to achieve scale. We have not achieved as much scale at the pace that we should have and that's where we've got laser focused right now.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you share with us, when you look at your fee revenue for this quarter, let's call it 2.3 billion, you gave us some color on the servicing fee sensitivity to the markets, but out of the total 2.3 billion, how much is at equity related. Ron mentioned that you've got a disproportionate amount of equity customers in your client base, so what would be a good estimate of that number being tied to equity type customers?","Eric Aboaf","Gerard, I\u2019m trying to think if we have a quantitative estimate in our disclosure on that. We do disclose the mix of some of the ACAs in our supplement, the mix of equities in for our asset management business and then obviously our sec lending is a heavy equity based underlying business. So I do think that we have higher equity exposure than kind of the servicing industry in aggregate. I don't know that I have an excellent estimate, because remember even when we custody for funds that are multiple asset funds, there is a wide range. If you do turn to page 9 in our financial supplement, you will see that there is one thought of our $31.6 trillion of assets under custody and we described 18 billion of those being equity based. ","So I think that's a good indication on the custodial side and then on the asset management side, we also do the equity cut on page 10. So, it's significant, it's in the -- you can see it's in the 55, 60, 60-ish percentage range and so we are somewhat dependent on equity markets. I think that's why, in good times, we need -- we're going to be able to benefit from that, but we also need to make sure that we are heavily \u2013 that we are always careful on expenses and create that scalable cost base, so that we don't actually add too many costs in good time, so that we can navigate through. But it is certainly part of our business model.","Gerard Cassidy","And then to follow up, I think Ron, you touched on the pricing headwinds historically or maybe Eric you brought it up that 1.5% to 2% was something that was common, but it looked like in 2018, it bumped up to 4%, you're looking for something similar in 2019. What's driving that? Is that competitors are just being much more aggressive and they're willing to price products at maybe, leaving a loss as just the way of getting the business and maybe cross selling other products, but what do you think has driven it up to doubling what it used to be?","Ron O'Hanley","Gerard, I think it's what we said earlier, the amount I heard these clients are on is quite high. So typical asset manager, whether you're large, medium or small. So there's just inordinate pressure coming from the client base with the number one. Number two, this assumption, particularly when you're pricing an asset management client, that there'll be both market and fees that will over time actually make what looks like an entry level price, that takes an entry level price and may look like it's too thin, kind of make it fall over time as flows and market help out. ","When that assumption goes away, it just lays bare that the price that you had as an initial price on a sustained basis in fact isn't sustainable. So at least for us, can't speak for the obviously rest of the industry, it has caused us to be much more careful about how we think about this. That in addition to getting more term, so that pricing can change overnight, looking at what other products and as Eric talked about earlier, the product stack as you move up from custody becomes -- it tends to be less, it's not price insensitive, but less and less price sensitive or less and less commodity like, if you will. And looking hard at deposits and then as importantly, making sure that we try and get another part of the wallet or some consolidation out of it and in most cases, we're getting some or all of those kinds of things.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","So I wanted to ask a follow-up question on capital return. Last year, in CCAR, you were about 50 basis points short of that stress tier 1 leverage target. Your capital ratios are flat year on year. Eric, you gave a lot of really helpful color, talking about the actions you've taken to improve your CCAR standing. What I'm wondering is if the Fed stress test assumptions are similar to last year, what gives you that confidence that you can achieve an 80% payout target. Is that \u2013 should we view that more as a medium term target or do you think you can get there in the upcoming tests?","Eric Aboaf","It's Eric. We're optimistic about this upcoming task where there's no certainty on it. So, but we're optimistic. I think we're optimistic for two reasons that we have under control and then there's one that we don't, right. The two that we do have are under our control are number one, the shape of the investment portfolio and if you remember, we made adjustments in the first quarter of last year, where we saw the results and how those played through in to CCAR, so we had a good understanding of the kind of the change this and then results in that and then we made some more adjustments to the fourth quarter of this year based on some of those learnings and the other six data points we've had over the last year.","The second one is because of the way we've now better understood the counterparty stress test that the Fed runs, right, we've actively intervened in terms of how we actually structure and limit our counterparty exposures across our businesses, whether that's in FX, whether that\u2019s in securities lending and so we've made very conscious choices, some of which have impacted revenue and you've seen that in particular in sec lending to actually adjust our exposure levels. Now, we're trying to transact with our best clients as much as we used to before, but in some cases, we've had to be more calibrated. So we have literally, if we -- if you go down to the trading floor and the risk management team, they\u2019ve literally had new parameters that they've installed that we've been operating at since late summer and early fall. ","So both of those give us some confidence that we can -- that we should be able to do better this year. The obvious unknown is the test itself, right, there's the macroeconomic shock, what's in that. There is global market trading bookshop, which has the counterparty piece to it. And then it's everything else in the test, including assumptions for balance sheet growth and so forth. And on those areas, we don't have any new information obviously won't until we see some of that in late this month or early next month and then we see the test come through in June.","Steven Chubak","Got it. And just one more follow up for me on capital optimization efforts, you continue to have a significant amount of preferred in your capital stack, certainly well in excess of many of your peers. I was hoping you could speak to your capacity or appetite to maybe redeem some of those preferreds and how we could possibly think about the timing of redemptions and the associated savings?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. I think the way I would describe the capital stack is the capital stack is proportioned relative to how the current rules are written and implemented through CCAR, where the leverage ratios matter and so there's obviously an importance of having press in the stack. If that were to change, we'd obviously reconsider and so that would give us an opportunity to call or to adjust the alternative tier 1 component, which is the press. I do think though as we go into CCAR, our first priority is to return capital to our common equity holders, right. We're quite conscious of the -- of some of our dealer activity in our issuances this past year and we feel like the first priority is to get capital back to our common equity holders, as we go through the CCAR process this year.","Steven Chubak","And just one quick follow up relating to that common equity remark, just given the Fed\u2019s willingness to greenlight payouts, north of 100%, the fact that they've clearly indicated that they're to have this binary pass fail outcome, given the context that you're having all the changes that you've made to reposition yourself ahead of CCAR, would you actually look in the near term and maybe exceed that 80% in order to more aggressively mitigate the dilution impact from CRD?","Eric Aboaf","We have said that we'd like to and we're optimistic that we can do better than 80%, so that's exactly the intention and intention and hope that we have and I'll just be clear that there is some of both that's necessary for that, but that is what we'd like to be able to deliver this year and we believe we've made some of the adjustments necessary at our end of the -- that are under our own control to effectuate that. So we're -- we'd like to be able to deliver on that, that would be our intention, given what we've -- how we're proceeding.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous.","Geoffrey Elliott","On the fee income guide, just to be clear first of all, the 3% to 4% down points to about 2.2 billion and then annualizing that, we kind of get to an annual run rate of about 8.8, if that was sustained, is that right?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, it's Eric. That's right. I mean, that's where we're trying to start with where we are today and we're trying to adjust for the markets, the flows, the limited amount of client transaction activity and then you have the lumpiness from trading, from 4Q to 1Q, right. So, we always want to be careful and appropriately conservative there. And then there's just the 606 effects of Charles River. So we\u2019ve tried to factor all that in to our estimates.","And then we've said that, that's a good run rate for several quarters, we'd like that to be just a quarter or two, not very long, but we're trying to be careful here and to be honest, we're trying to be careful about revenues, because we think if we're doing that, then we're going to be even more effective and adroit in interventions on expenses and we think that's what we should demand of ourselves and what you would all expect of us.","I think the scenarios on revenue though are very wide to be honest, because there is a range of different market assumptions, flow assumptions and underlying transaction activity. We just have some -- we just have a little more visibility into the first quarter, including the usual adjustments on market flows, macroeconomics and a little bit of pricing, which tends to be a little deeper in the first quarter than the out quarters, just the way the calendar works and so we're just trying to factor that in, but off of that base, I think there's a range of scenarios and we'd obviously like to see more positive ones and if we see those, we've got to set a conference schedule set up in February and March and in May, we'll certainly update for changes.","Geoffrey Elliott","It sounds like in the sort of market assumptions that you're showing on slide 16, that could be a run rate that sticks around for a couple of quarters. Is that fair? I just want to make sure that we're understanding it right.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. That could be the case and that's what we're calibrating our expense we\u2019re up to.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Morgan Stanley, I\u2019m sorry, JP Morgan.","Vivek Juneja","Hi. This is Vivek. Thanks. A couple of questions for you folks. Firstly, Eric, on CRD, the operating margin obviously in Q4, because of FAS 606 is a little bit inflated, what, on a full year basis, what would you guide us to as a sort of a more normalized operating margin, before you put in any cost savings or anything else?","Eric Aboaf","Vivek, I think we disclosed back in July an operating margin for that business at around 50% on the old ASC basis. I think the way the current year adjusts a bit, you might get for going from 605 to 606, just given the pattern of how -- what they've, how they've done the accounting historically versus now, you get a small uptick in margin from there. I think then the modeling becomes -- has probably two facets going in. One is the investments that we're making in the business and then the revenue ramp up, relative to those investments and that will tend to trend the margin rate down a bit, as we, in the early year, to building the business.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. All right, because while you cautioned us on not annualizing the revenues, I\u2019m presuming the costs we can analyze, if we have modeling out CRD separately, right? Yeah. Okay. Different question. You called out in your NIM, one-time benefits from hedging activities, can you quantify that and is how much of that in the fourth quarter?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. In the fourth quarter, it was about $6 million roughly and a little bit comes from some of the dislocation being swap markets, we've taken our swap positions down over the year as you know, but there's always some dislocations towards the, obviously over the holiday season in particular towards the end of the quarter. So we saw a little bit of that. And it was a positive dislocation, because of how the currencies between euro and some of the -- and yen actually played through, so that was a positive.","And then on long term debt, you get a little bit of this mark to market adjustment in the underlying accounting as you got rates and credit spreads move a little bit, so about 6 bucks and it will just, which won't reappear in the first quarter.","Vivek Juneja","Can I sneak in another one, which as you combined an accounting with FX and brokerage, I know a lot of -- part of brokerage used to have electronic FX trading, the rest of it, things like transition management, have they just diminished to a smaller base or has something else changed?","Eric Aboaf","No. I think what we're trying to do is literally simplify the disclosure and if we did something that took helpful materials away, we can certainly revisit, but we had a line that was historically called total trading services, which is both our direct foreign exchange trading plus our, what I'll call, electronic foreign exchange venues. Those were in what was called brokerage and then some of the other kind of fun connect, like our money market, electronic venue, a little bit of transition management and a few other smaller items like portfolio solutions. So we've just, I think, relabeled that total FX trading services, just to give it the kind of the description that's appropriate. I think within that, I'm just scanning through, about 80% percent of those revenues are foreign exchange related, the rest tend to be a little bit of the money market or portfolio solutions type activity.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.

On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley, will speak first. Then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com.

O\u2019Hanley","Thanks, Ilene and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 3, we announced our fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results this morning. Fourth quarter EPS and ROE were $1.73 and 11.6% respectively, while full year 2019 EPS was $5.75, and ROE was 10.0%. Ex-notables fourth quarter EPS was $1.98, and ROE was 13.3%. Relative to both the prior year period and the third quarter of 2019, I am pleased to report that our fourth quarter pretax margin improved, reaching 29.1%, excluding notable items. We also saw an improvement in pretax margin at Global Advisors relative to the third quarter of 2019.","Before reviewing our performance further, let me touch on some of the macro factors that had an effect in 2019. Following the dramatic global equity market sell-off in late 2018, our results over the course of 2019 benefited from the steady recovery of the U.S. equity market during the year. While international equity markets improved somewhat, average levels in 2019 were still down relative to the full year of 2018. Total industry fund flows were favorable to 2018, primarily driven by broad-based flows in Europe and strong money market flows. However, in North America, industry flows into long-term funds remain negative, albeit less so than 2018. We experienced three interest rate cuts and lower long end rates which impacted NII, as well as low market volatility for much of the year, which in turn impacted our markets businesses.","Our full year 2019 results also reflected the impact from the still elevated level of industry servicing fee pricing pressure, which moderated for us in the second half of the year. As a result of these headwinds, it was clear that we needed to take aggressive management actions to stabilize revenues and reduce expenses while keeping client satisfaction at the center of all we do. I am pleased with the progress we made and how that translated into results, particularly in the second half of the year.","Assets under custody and administration increased 4% quarter-over-quarter to a record $34.4 trillion. We saw a strong level of new wins during the quarter, totaling $294 billion, which took our total wins in 2019 to just over $1.8 trillion within touching distance of our record amount of wins in 2018. Assets yet to be installed stood at $1.2 trillion at quarter-end. At Global Advisors, assets under management increased 6% quarter-over-quarter to a record $3.1 trillion supported by higher period end market levels and strong U.S. and European net flows to our SPDR range of ETFs. During 2019, Global Advisors recorded over $100 billion in total net inflows driven by strong ETF institutional and cash net flows relative to 2018.","Relative to the year ago period, fourth quarter total revenue increased 1%, reflecting improved servicing and management fees, driven by stronger equity markets, partially offset by lower NII and markets revenues. On a sequential and year-over-year basis, fourth quarter total fee revenue increased 5% and 2%, respectively. Full year 2019 total revenue decreased 3% year-over-year as a result of lower fee revenue and NII, partially offset by the positive contribution of Charles River Development.","We are pleased that we were able to begin to grow servicing fee revenue again with our focus on client service. Servicing fees increased 3% during the second half of 2019 relative to the first half of the year. During 2019, we implemented a number of client initiatives to drive better service quality and deepen relationships. This included the completion of our senior executive client coverage model for our largest clients. We also implemented a new client on-boarding process that has enabled us to scale rapidly and take on large tranches of business while also meeting client service requirements. Further, we implemented changes to better manage client pricing decisions with the establishment of an executive deal review committee. We know that there is more for us to do. And as we begin 2020, reigniting total revenue growth remains a core strategic priority for all of us. We believe that building out our front-to-back Alpha platform strategy provides an attractive value proposition for our clients.","During 2019, we undertook significant actions to improve our operational efficiency and reduce expenses. This time last year, we launched a comprehensive firm-wide expense savings program to aggressively manage down expenses driven by new resource discipline, process reengineering, and automation efforts. Initially targeting $350 million of gross expense saves, we subsequently increased our expense savings target to $400 million, which we exceeded, finishing the year at $415 million in gross expense savings. Part of our efforts were aimed at tackling headcount growth, which have been too high for too many years. During 2019, we successfully reduced total headcount by 3% from year-end 2018 driven by automation and standardization as well as process reengineering, with high cost location headcount down by over 3,400. As a result, we reduced our full year 2019 expenses, excluding notable items in CRD by almost 2%, thus exceeding our initial target of 1%.","As we look to 2020, we remain focused on reducing our total expense base again. This past December, I outlined the outcome of the initial reassessment of our technology cost structure. In the coming year, we are targeting a change in the trajectory of our IT expenditure, aiming for it to be flat to down 2% during 2020, excluding notable items. For resource discipline and process reengineering efforts, we are also targeting a reduction of total expenses company-wide, excluding notable items, by approximately 1% during 2020.","During 2019, we were also particularly focused on balance sheet management. As a result of a number of deposit initiatives as well as improved client engagement, we have recorded a third straight quarter of total average deposit growth. In addition, as a result of an improvement of balance sheet under stress following the 2019 CCAR stress test, we increased our quarterly common dividend by 11% to $0.52 per share. Further, we returned $2.3 billion to our shareholders during 2019, including $500 million of common share repurchases during the fourth quarter.","To conclude, during my first year as CEO in 2019, we have faced a number of challenges but through our actions, we have made measurable progress towards our goals, particularly expense management and capital return. My focus for 2020 will continue to be on delivering a distinct value proposition and world-class service to our clients, enabling us to reignite revenue growth while generating further expense reductions with sustainable improvements in our operating model. We remain confident in the trajectory of our business. We expect that our global reach and expertise in servicing and data analytics, combined with our unique front-to-back Alpha strategy, will enable us to realize our vision of becoming the leading asset servicer, asset manager, and data insight provider to the owners and managers of the world's capital. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.","Eric Aboaf","Thank you, Ron and good morning everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results, I'd like to take a moment on Slide 4 to discuss several notable items. In 4Q 2019, we recognized $110 million of pretax repositioning cost consisting of severance and real estate, which sets us up to drive further process automation and organizational rationalization in 2020. We also had $29 million of acquisition and restructuring charges, primarily related to Charles River as expected and in addition, we had a $44 million gain related to the tender of sub debt in 4Q 2019 and a $22 million after-tax costs associated with the redemption of our Series E preferred securities. Taken together, we recognized notable items of $95 million pretax or $0.25 per share. You'll find a bit more detail in the appendix.","Moving to Slide 5, on the top panel we show our quarterly and full year GAAP results. On the bottom panel, we show results ex notable items for those of you who want to see some of the underlying trends. I would note that we were able to generate positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter on both the GAAP and ex notables basis, helping to improve our 4Q 2019 pretax margin both quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year.","Turning to Slide 6, we saw end-of-period AUC\/A levels increase 9% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-year move was driven by higher end-of-period market levels and client flows, partially offset by a previously announced client transition, which is now largely behind us. Quarter-on-quarter, the AUC\/A increase was mainly due to higher end-of-period equity market levels, client flows and net new business. AUM levels increased 24% year-on-year to a record $3.1 trillion driven largely by higher end-of-period market levels and strong net inflows of approximately $100 billion, which were spread relatively evenly across our institutional cash and despite a range of ETFs. Amidst the challenging organic growth environment for asset managers, State Street Global Advisors realized AUM share gains during the year in both money market funds and across our low-cost ETF array. It's a reminder that our business is positioned to further scale its offerings and to improve margins in doing so.","Moving to Slide 7, servicing fees were up 1% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter. As Ron discussed, while industry pricing pressure persists, the pace of quarter-over-quarter servicing fee headwinds continue to moderate in 4Q 2019 with this quarter's results showing three consecutive quarters of stable to increasing servicing fees, primarily driven by higher average market levels and net new business. And while equity markets were supportive over the course of the year, we are confident that management actions taken since late last year, including the rollout of our new client coverage model and newly formed executive pricing committee, have had and are continuing to have an impact. Nevertheless, there is much more to do, as Ron mentioned driving higher servicing fee growth will remain a strategic priority in 2020. And we continue to see significant interest in our front-to-back Alpha platform. We now have four wins, all of which have expanded our scope of business with existing clients.","On the bottom right panel of this page, we've again included some sales performance indicators to provide a little more texture. As you can see, AUC\/A wins totaled $294 billion in 4Q 2019 and approximately $1.8 trillion for the full year. The sizable wins this quarter and throughout the year again demonstrate the benefit of our scale and capabilities as we build new relationships and continue to grow existing client relationships by providing additional products and services.","Turning to Slide 8, let me discuss the other fee revenue lines, beginning with management fees. 4Q 2019 revenues were up 6% year-on-year, primarily due to higher average equity market levels and inflows from ETF and cash, partially offset by mix changes away from higher fee institutional products. Compared to 3Q 2019, management fees were up 4% driven by higher average equity market levels and inflows from ETFs, partially offset by outflows from institutional. FX trading services were down 7% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter as the business was negatively impacted by low volatility levels, partially offset by higher volumes. Securities finance revenues were also down 8% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter due mainly to lower industry volumes and spreads. Finally, software and processing fees were up 18% year-on-year and 54% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting higher CRD revenue and positive market-related adjustments.","Moving to Slide 9, you'll see in the top left panel a five quarter summary of CRD's stand-alone revenue and pretax income. For 4Q 2019, CRD generated $126 million of stand-alone revenues, which was up 4% year-on-year and 48% quarter-on-quarter. I would again remind this audience the lumpiness inherent in the ASC 606 revenue reporting accounting standards and not to read across any one quarter's results. On the upper right panel, we've also included a comparison of CRD's 2019 stand-alone revenue versus an estimate of 2018 revenue, pro forma for the ASC 606 reporting standard, had we owned the business for the full year. As you can see, CRD generated $401 million of revenue in full year 2019, up 8% versus $372 million of estimated pro forma revenues in full year 2018. On the bottom right panel, we wanted to provide you with a bit more texture on the momentum we're seeing in the business and how we've enhanced it since our acquisition last year. We remain confident in the revenue and cost synergy goals announced at the time of the acquisition.","Turning to Slide 10, NII was down 9% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter, with our NIM declining 19 and 6 basis points, respectively. The sequential decrease in NII was primarily driven by the absence of episodic market-related benefits seen in 3Q 2019, partially offset by increased deposit balances. Excluding the episodic benefits seen in 3Q, NII would have been up 2% sequentially. Our deposit gathering initiatives continue to generate benefits. Average total deposits are up three straight quarters and up 3% year-on-year. Interest-bearing deposits are up 9% year-on-year, and noninterest-bearing deposits have been steady for the third straight quarter at approximately $29 billion. On the earning asset side, we targeted careful growth in client lending and a modestly larger investment portfolio, with both the average 4Q loans ex overdrafts and the investment portfolio up 12% year-over-year.","On Slide 11, we're again providing a view of expenses this quarter ex notable so that the underlying trends are readily apparent. Year-over-year, our 4Q expenses, excluding notable items, were down 2% and flat quarter-on-quarter. You can see consistent improvement in the comp and benefits as well as several other lines. As you recall, we announced the 2019 expense program this time last year with an initial target of $350 million. And thanks to a significant company-wide effort, we achieved approximately $415 million in saves in the full year, exceeding our initial target by nearly $65 million.","And so let me provide some color on a couple of optimization initiatives that really helped us reduce costs last year. First, supplier negotiations and consolidation have been a big focus. We've made great strides in both telecom and tech infrastructure services while also consolidating the number of our IT vendors. Second, the organization has been focused on realizing greater productivity. Automation initiatives launched last year have now led to four consecutive quarters of total headcount declines, resulting in high-cost location headcount reductions of about 3,400 this year, more than double our original target of 1,500. More to come in 2020 as we continue to work on every line of the P&L.","Moving to Slide 12, during the quarter, we returned a total of approximately $686 million of capital to shareholders. And for the full year of 2019, we returned approximately $2.3 billion of capital, representing 108% of net income available to common, as we executed our 2019 CCAR plan and delivered on our priority of increasing our capital return to shareholders. Moving to the right side of 12, you can see that both the standardized and advanced approaches CET1 ratio is at a healthy 11.9% even with that level of capital return. We also consciously reduced our Tier 1 leverage and SLR ratios, primarily driven by the post-CCAR redemption of our Series E preferred stock, which is worth about $0.12 of EPS. We remain confident in our capital position and believe that we have incremental opportunities to continue to optimize our capital structure as changes to the capital rules are finalized.","Turning now to Slide 13, I'd like to cover our full year 2020 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter of 2020. Before I start, let me first share some of the assumptions underlying our current views for the full year. At a macro level, we are assuming slow global growth interest rates based on the current forward curve, and a modest uplift from equity markets as well as continued low market volatility, which impacts our trading businesses. So beginning with revenue, we currently expect that fee revenue will be up 1% to 3% for 2020. This includes servicing fees growing modestly at the low to middle end of this range. Management fees growing at the high end of this range, and CRD revenue should grow at low double-digits.","Regarding the first quarter of 2020, we would expect fee revenue to be down quarter-over-quarter by low single digits, perhaps 2% to 3% given headwinds such as the expected asset mix shift by a single client in asset management as well as seasonally lower CRD revenue. Regarding NII, we expect it to be down 5% to 7% in 2020 versus 2019 driven by the carryover impact of lower market rates and some continued rotation in the deposit book. Regarding first quarter of 2020, we expect NII to be down about 5% sequentially driven by the full quarter impact of the October's Fed rate cut, lower day count, and the fourth quarter long-term debt issuance. On a positive note, we do expect that NII should largely stabilize in the second half of 2020, assuming of course, that there isn't a significant change in the interest rate environment.","Turning to expenses, as you can see in the walk, we will continue to be laser-focused on expenses and expect to achieve approximately 4% to 5% in savings driven by our continued focus on resource discipline and process engineering as well as our technology optimization plan. This will include a reduction in headcount of an additional 750 roles in high-cost locations in 2020, which is related to the repositioning charge I mentioned earlier. These expense saves will be partially offset by approximately 3% to 4% of ongoing business building investment scenarios like CRD, tech infrastructure, and the variable cost of new business growth. This should yield a net 1% reduction, excluding notable items, in 2020 total expenses.","Regarding first quarter 2020, we expect expenses to be largely in line with this guide year-over-year and consistent with the seasonal expenses usually occurring in the first quarter. Taxes should be in the 17% to 19% range for the year, but we expect first quarter 2020 to be at the high end of that range. And finally, given our strong capital position and recent capital optimization, we expect to continue to actively return capital to common equity holders in the form of payouts and returns, subject, of course, to the Federal Reserve scenarios and associated approvals.","So moving to our summary of full year 2019 results on Page 14, we were pleased to see fee revenue improve over the course of the recent quarters as management actions and moderating fee pressure helped drive total fee revenue up 2% in the second half of 2019 versus the first half. At the same time, we continue to navigate a challenging interest rate environment and enhance NII with deposit gathering initiatives with three straight quarters of total deposit growth. We also successfully executed on our full year 2019 expense savings program, significantly exceeding our initial savings and headcount reduction targets and helping drive down expenses, ex-notable items and CRD, by 2% year-over-year, demonstrating our ability to bend the cost curve. We're committed to doing more in 2020.","Finally, we continue to optimize our capital structure and delivered on our promise of increased capital return to shareholders with approximately $2.3 billion in capital return in 2019 for a total payout of 108%. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.","Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley","Operator, can we open the line to questions?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Eric, you just ran through a bunch of color on expectations for the year in 1Q. One that I was hoping to dig a little in on is the fee revenue side. I think you said that the 1Q fee revenue growth down 2% to 3% sequentially, and you gave a couple of factors. Does that guidance include what we've seen so far year-to-date in the equity markets, which has been pretty robust or is that a potential offset if it proves to be durable through the quarter? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Brennan, it's Eric. The guidance is effectively as a combination at the end of the year. And obviously, if there's large dislocations between then and now, we factor it in. I think you'd say equity markets are up. Volatility still, though, on -- and trading is still pretty light. We've not seen that big January uptick that I think we used to see four or five years ago. Interest rates have been, call it, puttering around. So I don't think there's a lot that's really changed, and this is an outlook effectively based on what we see now. I think as I described, there's some basis, just the usual seasonality like in Charles River, which peaks in fourth quarter just because of the cycle of sales that's come through and then dip in first quarter. We have some visibility into servicing fees. Asset management fees, I noted will take a bit of a step down. Trading, we'll see. So it's kind of a combination that we're looking at.","Brennan Hawken","That's all really fair. Thanks for that color. And then when we think about some of these robust equity markets that we've seen, and you guys have clearly done a really good job of trying to get your hands around the elevated fee pressure that you were seeing over early 2019 and leading into that. In the past, we've seen some breakage in fee rate when equity markets rally really hard really fast because your servicing fees are not all just purely contractually a percentage of AUC's basis points on assets under custody. Some of them are inflation, some of them were pegged activity levels and the like. So can you help us think about -- should we be prepared for optically the way we model State Street some fee rate pressure here in the near term just because of those mechanical factors rather than thinking -- I just -- I know some people think that when the equity markets go up, okay, then the servicing fee is going to go up with the fee rate being flat. In the past, it hasn't worked out that way, so just trying to think about how to calibrate for that?","Ronald P. O'Hanley","Brennan, it's Ron. Let me begin on that. I mean in the past, you're correct, there has been a cycle when you've seen sharp-up equity markets that has been followed by a relook by the client base at what they're paying, and we have a fee renegotiation. And that's still possible. I think what's different this time is, firstly, we have comprehensively been through the client base, either at their bidding or at our bidding. In some instances, we've been the proactive ones wanting to take control of the situation. We've tended to get more term out of these things. And in general, the level of partnership that's between us and our clients now is at a much higher level. So I would suspect -- my expectation would be that certainly, there'll be some conversation, but I would not expect the same kind of effect that we've seen in the past.","Eric Aboaf","Yes, Brennan, I'd just add the kind of quantitative side to this is, remember, most of our fee schedules in the servicing business are based off of averages, average for a quarter or multiple months within a quarter or what have you. And so it's worth just remembering that if you take through the depreciation, stock market indices, and I think there is a good table on the top right of Page 6 in our slide deck, the S&P -- and this is 4Q to 4Q. But if you think about it on a full year basis, which I think a number of you have, the S&P was up 29% and the period -- end-of-period, that feels great. But the average was up only 6%, right? The EAFE average point-to-point was up 18%. On average, it was actually down 4%. So it's really the averages that are factoring through. And I just encourage you to think about those as you think about modeling the servicing fee effects. And in addition, those are what the -- but what we focus on, both from a -- as we think about the calculation of the servicing fees, but also what the clients think about as part of the billing process.","Brennan Hawken","That's great color, thanks and apologies for jumping in the weeds straight off to bat on you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks. Curious if you could talk -- and you might have touched on it a little bit, but if you could talk on your deposit optimization efforts, what's working and where you are through the process you've been going through client by client. 4% growth is good. Do you consider any of it repo environment related and transient? Just curious to get the mark-to-market on that.","Eric Aboaf","Sure, Glenn. It's Eric. Let me start. Deposit initiatives were something that we really began to focus on late in fourth quarter of 2018, I think I'd say, and then it's been an intense effort for 4 or 5 quarters now. And it really is in response to thinking about how do we serve our clients with our balance sheet. Now as you say, sometimes it's deposits, sometimes it's cash money market sweeps into Guest Manager. Sometimes it's some of the sponsored repo that we do. So there's a series of different areas. I don't think it's particularly -- the results of those initiatives on a year-on-year basis are north of $10 billion of deposits, tend to be more on the interest-bearing side because that's what's discretionary. It's come in probably three buckets. The largest of the buckets is working with our custody clients and thinking about how to serve them on their discretionary cash. Sometimes it's the asset managers. Sometimes it's insurers. Sometimes it's the pension funds. So that's been -- that's probably been the biggest piece.","We've also, I think, built up over time a book of corporate deposits. Because remember, not only do we have partners and suppliers for corporations, but because of our custody of the pension plans, right, we have often an introduction from the pension -- the defined benefit pension plans or 401(k) plan into the corporate treasurer. And so that creates a natural access. And then the third bucket is we always supplement with a little bit of CDs or broker deposits, but I think that's been probably the smallest of this of the three buckets. So those are the kind of initiatives we've taken. They've been, I think, material in terms of continuing to build our balance sheet, which then lets us -- provides enough oxygen, in effect, for us to build our loan book, our investment portfolio, our trading book. And so that's kind of part of how we think about running the bank. And then specific to your question of what have been better, different, lower, higher because of quantitative easing or not, I don't think the initiatives would have been particularly different. I do think there is more deposits in the system, in the banking system, and we've seen some of that probably starting in the second half of the third quarter in that kind of period when the Fed began to intervene and into fourth quarter. It's hard to dimension how much there is, but you and I both read the Fed H.8 reports, and that kind of gives you a little bit of an indication.","Glenn Schorr","I appreciate that. And maybe one more on just the servicing wins. $294 billion in the quarter, $1.8 trillion for the year. If you look at that, that's over 5% organic growth. Now obviously, it's a gross number, not net. I don't know if you want to share just a ballpark range of where net is. But then the specific question is if you can help us with the composition of what's in the one but not yet funded pipe, I see some of the press releases, I see some ETF wins in there in the fourth quarter, but maybe just help us think through what's in there?","Ronald P. O'Hanley","Yes, Glenn. It's Ron. It's a mix of things that are in there. It's -- some of it is true one-offs, meaning we've won something. It's in the queue to be installed. It'll be installed. More typically, just given the nature of our client base, which tends to be larger asset managers and asset owners, when we win something, we install in tranches. Sometimes it could be very conventional business, like we have a very large mutual fund win earlier in the year. But some of the funds are more complicated than others. Sometimes the client wants it done in a particular sequence around their fund boards. So there's some of that in there. You can probably draw the conclusion that the more complicated of business tends to get involved later.","The other thing that's in there, though, is, increasingly, the nature of our business is that we're not just winning a custody or accounting assignment, but we're winning all or a portion of the front-to-back, meaning there's some middle office in there, there might be some Charles River in there. So oftentimes, what you're seeing is a installation of another service for an existing client where we had an install earlier in the year. And that's the way to think about it.","Glenn Schorr","Got it, okay. That's interesting. I appreciate it. And is it in and around the range of the average margin because I know going piece by piece would be impossible, but just like the ones that not yet funded, is it coming in at a higher level, average level or below average level?","Eric Aboaf","Glenn, it's Eric. It's -- I think, as Ron said, it's a mix. It's -- well, it's a mix of fee rate and it's a mix of timing. And as you could see, it could be installed where it's high a quarter ago. It's high again this quarter. And so sometimes this installs more quickly. Sometimes more slowly. So just -- I know it's hard to model. I just encourage you to put a big band around it.","Glenn Schorr","Cool, well your outlook comments help, so we will take it at that. Thanks guys. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Kenneth Usdin","Thanks, good morning guys. To follow-up on the NII outlook, Eric, I was wondering when you talk about the expected decline next year, can you just give us a little bit more color on just the dynamics of how much and how the lower rates from last year still roll through on the NIM? And also against your point about there being some excess deposits in the system, but you're still growing these deposits from your strategic initiatives, can the balance sheet also expand to continue to expand from here, so I guess just a split dynamic of what happens on the NIM side versus what happens on the balance sheet? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Yes, Ken. It's Eric. You're right that -- you're asking the volume question and the rate question. So maybe -- let me do that in that order. I think from a volume perspective, the two drivers that we see in this business are firstly, the amount of wins that we have in custody and accounting because those typically come with those residual deposits that -- the frictional deposit in the system. So those will come based on the kind of the win rates that we have and some of the installation. I think the other one is the deposits in the system and I think we've clearly seen a bit of an uptick quarter-over-quarter based on the bank-wide data as well as some of the -- some of what you've seen in our results and a couple of the other banks that you've all seen that in the Fed statistics.","I think the question is, what happens to deposits in the banking system over the next year? Did we just -- did the Fed in effect with its easing process over the last four, five, six months get us to a new level and then we just go back to the slow build off of that or is there going to be more or less Fed activity and I'll leave that one to -- for you to think about. I think that one is the uncertainty. So we do expect some amount of modest deposit growth. I think the -- what we're careful on, on deposits and we still expect to see is some amount of continued rotation from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing or interest-bearing into treasuries because you're seeing that in the underlying asset holdings of our clients in the industry. And as we think about the volume of deposits going forward, we've been comforted that there have been three quarters in a row of stable noninterest-bearing deposits. But I'll remind you, third quarter and fourth quarter of 2018 actually saw an uptick in noninterest-bearing deposits, and then it fell by -- it fell significantly in the first quarter of 2019 from 4Q 2018. So we're hesitant to think that we're -- we've gotten to a sea change. We like to see a flattening of that line, but we're hesitant to call that a sea change just yet, which is why we do think there will be some continued rotation in the coming quarters and year.","I think from a rate standpoint, it's everything you'd expect as long rates still have a negative effect on a full year basis again. So long rates, I guess I should say, long rates have a negative effect as the tractor of the investment portfolio plays through. And unless long rates pop up 30, 40, 50 bps, you still have that playing through to a negative. You have the short rates are -- kind of have been reset, and so we're going to -- it's going to take 3 or 4 quarters to lap ourselves, and so you have that effect playing through. And then you have some -- as we think about the first quarter, as an example, you've got some transactional impacts, right, as we call those perhaps, we replace them with long-term debt, right, because we have TLAC requirements. And so in effect, I end up with a higher net income, but the -- I get it -- we get higher available to common, but we also have a -- also have more interest expense because of how the P&L accounting is for us. So anyway, I'm hoping I covered most of it there.","Kenneth Usdin","Yes. And just one more, just balance sheet structure question to your point on the preferreds. You did that redemption. You said you were -- last quarter, you're able to do that before getting even the final. Could you continue to do more in that ahead of getting the finalization of SCB? Or does now SCB finalization really lead any further decisions you make about the balance sheet structure and capital actions?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, Ken, fair question. But obviously, we're -- any kind of decision by us around CCAR about interim capital actions is something that we just don't have an ability to telegraph beforehand or to really discuss. I'd just tell you, we always look at the full range of what we can do. We're always conscious that there are periods immediately after CCAR where one tends to have an opportunity. It gets a little more delicate in the first quarter. So let me just leave it at that. It's the kind of thing where I don't think timing matters a ton about when we take our capital actions, but the -- but we are looking at, obviously, the change in the leverage rules and then importantly, we need to see how the SCB comes through. And that's -- that I think we'll know in the coming weeks, and then we'll start to gear up for these -- for our annual CCAR process.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alexander Blostein","Thanks, hey, good morning everybody. Eric was hoping to dig into NIR in the quarter around some of the deposit cost trends. If I look at the non-U.S. side it looks like it was a negative 4 bps kind of number. I know there's some FX dynamics that are all through that, that could create a little bit of noise. But can you help us understand just kind of where you guys are in terms of deposit costs, how you expect it to evolve from here, and if there's anything one-off this quarter that helped that?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, Alex. It's Eric. I think there are a couple of probably elements here that are going through the deposit costs on the U.S. side and then the non-U.S. side. And the page for those of you on the phone probably best to look through is the financial addendum that we have, page 7 there's a detailed sort of average balance sheet table of the last eight quarters for everyone. On the U.S. side, you see our deposit costs came down, I think, a nice 19 basis points. Most of that is on the U.S. fee side. Obviously, this is a domicile view, not the currency view, but it's indicative. And that's really the effect of that October rate cut and the full quarter effect of that coming through, adjusted for our mix of pricing and so forth. And so I think you see the right sort of betas in that kind of 50% range that we've been seeing flowing through that line.","The non-U.S. domicile is a little messier. Part of what you see there -- and that one fell, those interest -- that interest expense fell more than you would naturally expect. It actually went from a positive interest expense to a credit in effect. Part of that was, remember, the ECB move, and we moved as well. We actually -- our beta was -- on that ECB move just as we had this begin to normalize NIM in the international markets as other banks are doing as well, given that it seems like it's going to be negative, not for a temporary period, but for the foreseeable future. And so we're beginning to -- I think the banking industry is beginning to reset what kind of NIM should be earned on deposits because of that change. And then we also have less in the FX swap costs and so we had less swap expense, which then goes through that line of the P&L and that we have in the footnotes, and that just bounced around a bit with the costs being on the interest-earning asset side.","Alexander Blostein","Got it, that's helpful, thanks. And then a slightly bigger picture question to you guys on profitability. I guess when we take a step back, obviously, a very nice move on expenses this year, and you guys have more to do next year. I guess when you go back a year or so ago, you had a slide out talking about medium-term pretax targets kind of shooting for 2 percentage point improvement in pretax margin. That's still the case, but I'm curious what's the base and what total may be the destination here because in 2018, pretax margins were 28, 29. You guys are kind of 26-ish this year. So I guess off of which base should we be thinking about the two percentage point improvement?","Eric Aboaf","Alex, it's Eric. Let me start on that because I think it's something that we've obviously been thinking through the markets. When we set those up with the markets at a certain point, they worked against us, both on the equity market side, which has largely bounced back. Now we need to kind of -- it's going to take a few more quarters to get to a place where we're pleased, and that was in our outlook. But it was also at a time when NII, right, was expected to go up, and NII has actually gone the other way. And I think I mentioned in one of the conferences late last year that, that change in NII cost us effectively two points of margin.","That said, that's just information. I think when we think about how we need to run this business, we still need to drive towards those targets and drive to those targets at pace. And I think we've been clear that at the time we set those, the pretax margin was in the 28% range. And I tell you, we're at 26% now. We need to -- we've got plans to get to 27%, 28% and 29% and ultimately get that three handle or the 30% handle on margin because we think this is a business that should operate at that level. And I think if you work through some of our guidance for this year, you see us making headway on margin, driving revenues up and expenses down. And I think you'd continue to expect that kind of leverage. Operating leverage and margin expansion is kind of tantamount and kind of a fundamental part of our planning process. So we're standing by those targets. We think they're important, and they were well set and those are -- that's where we're headed.","Alexander Blostein","Great, thanks so much for that. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks, good morning folks. Can you just come back to the pricing pressure concept in asset servicing and one detail I did miss, if you could just clarify, the fees down 2% to 3% in 1Q, just the servicing -- asset servicing fee component of that for 1Q? But the broader question is, we've had that 4% pricing pressure, I think, that you identified, Eric, a while back, and that had been moderating to that sort of 2% headwind. Just want to get your thought about that headwind coming into 2020 and clarify that, that's -- that is separate from a mix shift and when I talk about that as a -- the common mix shift towards ETF and away from mutual funds, which I know are lower revenue capture, albeit they are just as -- I believe, they're just as profitable because of the lower cost that's servicing them. So maybe if you could just talk about that dynamic in the -- as how that shapes that 2020 1% to 2% up for servicing fees?","Ronald P. O'Hanley","Why don't I begin this, Brian because there's a lot in what you asked in terms of pricing and how we think about our outlook on pricing and pricing pressure. I mean if you look back on this business for time immemorial, right, there's been -- there's kind of enduring deflation in the business, which we've all come to know and live with, and that's been a result of a combination of business growing, ability to scale, et cetera. And that's been historically a 2%.","There's also been mix shift that's been underway since then, too. I mean the mutual fund ETF move is not new. It certainly accelerated over the last few years. So -- and we expect that mix shift to continue. I mean the other factor in here is there's increasing concentration amongst ETF providers. We have a very large market share amongst ETF providers. But obviously, as those providers get larger, the nature of the fee rate typically is such that they're paying up less than the marginal asset.","So -- but this is the nature of the business, and that's what we have to deal with. So we do think and believe and we've said that's important. The pressure that we saw starting in 2018 and continuing out into 2019, we think that's abating. But we -- this is a business that has lived and will continue to live in the face of ongoing fee pressure, which is why we continue to be intensively focused on our operating model and how we build the business that can not only meet that, but that can become more and more profitable in that kind of environment.","Eric Aboaf","Brian, this is Eric. Let me add a little bit of a quantitative kind of estimations of the kind of Ron's summary there. So on pricing, I think, as he said, historically, there's always been a two percentage point or so headwind on pricing per year over the last couple of decade. Two years ago, we saw that tick up 4% kind of headwind. That was kind of 2017, 2018. And then last year, if you think about 2018 to 2019, that was also 4% headwind, roughly speaking. And then I think we've described how we've been marching through a set of renegotiations and resetting of pricing over that kind of 8 to 10 quarter time period.","As we look into our book of business and think about this coming year, what's factored into our outlook is approximately 3% pricing headwinds, so down from the 4%. And we've got some visibility, good visibility into first quarter and second quarter. And so that's factored into our outlook on servicing fee on a full year basis. To your point of where does mix come out, mix comes out in how we describe client flows and activity, and it's been relatively neutral. Activity is up a little bit with clients. Kind of transactional activity that flows, you're right, tend to work the other way around. So that's been a more neutral effect in aggregate relative to past history where it's been a slight positive of a point or two. And then finally, on first quarter, you asked -- I'll just remind you that what I guided to on fees for the quarter was down 2% to 3% in aggregate for fees. The downdrafts that I noted were in management fees and in CRD. And so by omission, I didn't really cover servicing fees because we expect those to be flattish, and we'll see how they'll play out. But that's our current expectation.","Brian Bedell","Great, that's great color. And maybe then just on CRD, you guys reiterated the revenue and cost synergy outline that you had from day 1. I know that's mostly a 2021 impact in terms of where you want to be. Maybe just an update on sort of the time line into that or how you're thinking about 2020 in terms of part of that $260 million to $280 million revenue goal for 2021. In other words, is that -- are you making material progress do you think in 2020 as it relates to your guidance there?","Ronald P. O'Hanley","Brian, it's Ron. I would say we absolutely are making material progress. And in terms of the synergies that we outlined, both revenue and cost, we expect those to play out actually in the time frame that we described earlier. But the more important impact or the even greater impact of Charles River has been around how it's affecting our core business and changing the nature of the conversation and the relationships that we're having with our clients.","As we noted, we signed 4 so-called front-to-back deals or Alpha platform in 2019. So in just over a year of ownership, we signed deals, which, in essence, means that we have a comprehensive and complete relationship with the client front-to-back. The pipeline there remains very strong. And even in those cases where the likely outcome is not a full front-to-back, it's changed the nature of how we're dealing with our clients from a one-off product provider to a true business process -- outsourcing partner with these clients, and I think that trend will carry on in many ways, fundamentally change the nature of our servicing business to the positive.","Brian Bedell","That's great. And is it more of a linear progression through 2021 or more of a hockey stick into 2021 as the deals -- as you see these deals in terms of revenue?","Ronald P. O'Hanley","I mean I'd expect it'll be largely linear, but with a bit of an uptick as we continue to build out the platform, I mean we announced over the year various platform partners that we've added to Alpha, and these are providers that are plugging into our platform and typically where we get a share of those economics. And I think you'll see at an increasing rate over 2020 and 2021 the number of those kinds of providers on the platform, and you'll see them -- the increasing importance of platform economics. And that will be less linear and more -- it's like how any platform grows, right? It starts out small and the momentum build as more and more become part of the platform.","Eric Aboaf","Brian, it's Eric. Add to that, the -- if you think about the revenue trajectory on the synergies, for example, part of what you'll see is some of the leading indicators, like bookings, have started to tick up. You saw those were up 28% on a year-on-year basis. And so that's what will begin to drive the Charles River kind of specific revenues this year and next year. I think in contrast to that, some of the revenue synergies were around connections with the State Street base of revenues. And in particular, the trading and sponsored repo kind of revenue activity that we've quickly tried to link into Charles River tends to actually happen earlier in the three year cycle than later just because of the speed at which we can either make the client kind of connections or the order management system connection. So there'll be a mix and I think sometime this year, we'll probably do maybe a more fulsome kind of where are we as we're year and half, two years into this deal and try to share more information and it sounds like that would be helpful.","Brian Bedell","Yeah, perfect, that's great color. Thanks so much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning. Eric, I wanted to just -- Eric, and I wanted to just dig in a little bit on some of the comments around the expenses. I think during the prepared remarks, you mentioned that there's more to come, and I would expect that, just wondering, should we anticipate that the pace of change, the rate of change of expense reductions, is it something you think you can continue for the next few years? Or is this 2020, we get the 1% down and then it's more hold it steady or continue to grow, so while I should say it to you, but grow in line with just core expense pressure, so I just wanted to get your understandings to the duration of your expectations around the more to come?","Ronald P. O'Hanley","Betsy, let me begin on that, and while we're not giving guidance beyond 2020 at this point, I would say that our ambition is to continue to manage expenses down, offset by the necessary investments that we need to make. We believe that there's more room for productivity improvement. Our automation efforts are underway, but we have much more in front of us than what we've accomplished. So we see a path to continued and ongoing expense management certainly through 2020 and likely beyond, is the way I would think about it. And part of that is we -- if you're going to win in this industry, that's what you need to do, right? We've talked about the servicing fee pressure, talked about the pressure that's on our clients, but it's also just about being able to scale at the level that we need to. I mean if you think about the amount of new business that we've brought in, the -- those assets could only have been brought in if there was confidence on the part of the client base that we would be able to scale that. And I just think that to be the leader in this business, we have to continue to get that productivity improvement driven by automation, driven by process redesign to be able to take on a business like that.","Betsy Graseck","If we get...","Ronald P. O'Hanley","Go ahead, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","I was just going to say, if we get a slightly different rate environment where rates come down again, do you feel like you have the flexibility to ramp up that expense reduction?","Eric Aboaf","Betsy, it's Eric. That was probably where I was going to go. I think we're quite conscious that in a slower top line growth environment, we're signaling 1% to 3% on fees this year. That's a year where you want to hold expenses, actually bring them down, right, because we need to create some real operating leverage and margin expansion. And so I think part of the answer to your question is if revenue growth is in that low single digits, then the expense is coming down, is the right answer.","I think to your point and the precise question that if revenues take a downtick, whether it's interest rate-driven or something else on the equity markets or something, then we would go deeper into expenses and we ration our reinvestment and just do it at a -- perhaps at a different pace. We'd find ways to accelerate some of our other optimization efforts. You're seeing what we're doing in IT, for example, that we described in December. We'd go deeper there. And just think about where we were in January of 2019, we announced 1% down and felt like, through the middle of the year, the environment hadn't gotten appreciably different. And so we ended up with 2% down. I think that's the kind of incremental action we would find a way to deliver if the environment were not favorable.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, thank you. And appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","James Mitchell","Hey, good morning. Maybe first question just on the CET1 ratio standardized, it jumped 60 basis points, look like a 5 billion reduction in RWAs. Kind of what drove that and is there more to do there?","Eric Aboaf","Jim, it's Eric. I think you're on the capital ratio pages where we've shown this quarter both standardized and advanced. And we did that because our binding constraint now is effectively both. They're almost right on top of one another. And I think you need to be a scientist to really understand the trend in each of those capital ratios. So let me try, and I'll -- we'll do a follow-up if necessary. So standardized, if you remember, is more volume-driven with some very -- relatively simplistic factors. And so the standardized ratio actually improved because standardized RWA fell sequentially, and that occurred, in particular, in the standardized RWA of our FX activities and our securities -- I'm sorry, our SEC lending activities. And that's kind of related to the lower levels of volatility in the market and lower actions. So that was the biggest downward driver of standardized.","If you take out your Ph. D. and want to think about advanced RWA, our advanced RWA went up, which is why the advanced ratio came down sequentially. And the advanced RWA increased because of loan growth and investment portfolio growth and a little bit of ops risk primarily. So those were -- it's a little bit apples and oranges, but that was the driver. I think from our perspective, we -- it just -- it's a good reminder that we live in a world of both, and we -- obviously, we'll manage to both. I think what I found comforting is, notwithstanding all our capital actions that we've taken and our higher payout, we actually are at real healthy capital levels, and that obviously gives us flexibility going forward. It sets us well -- it sets us up well for this cycle with CCAR, and we can take things from there.","James Mitchell","Absolutely, standardized is what matters for CCAR, and that going up is certainly a nice positive. So -- but maybe just the second question, following up on your guidance of kind of fee revenue growth of 1% to 3%, just maybe to push back a little bit on it. If I look at 4Q fees and normalize for seasonality and processing fees and then just annualized 4Q, I get to almost 2% growth in 2020. So it doesn't feel like a very ambitious target when you think about the S&P is now currently 8% above 4Q average level. So you have a pretty big tailwind in the markets. You have about 3.5% of growth from AUC\/A that's yet to be installed, the $1.1 trillion or $2 trillion is equivalent to 3.5% growth. You have the market tailwind, and you only have about 2% fee income growth. Is there something we're missing, I know you talked about the 3% reduction in the fee rate, but it seems like there could be a little better than that, and just please feel free to talk me down from that?","Eric Aboaf","Jim, it's Eric. I'm trying to come up with a realistic forecast because, to be honest, we'd actually like to be realistic of what we're seeing. And we also want to -- maybe back to one of the earlier questions, if we're realistic on revenue, we'll do the right thing on expenses. And so both matter in this business. But I think this is a realistic forecast. And obviously, if something changes dramatically, we'll -- up or down, that could have an effect. But let me just go through the pieces, so that you have a sense.","So on servicing fees, we said to the lower middle end of the 1% to 3% range. So I think that's pretty clear. I think if you think about it, the equity markets in the U.S. on average, and the averages matter here, will probably be up in the high single digits. So that'll provide a couple of percentage points tailwind in fees. There may be a little bit of -- there'll be obviously some amount of net new business, but there's also the fee headwinds still, that 3% that comes the other way that we need to overcome. And so that's why we get to the lower to middle end of the 1% or 3% range.","And remember, there are some businesses that are, in servicing fees, that are driving very quickly. We've noted, for example, EMEA sometimes or some of the asset management space, but there are others like our hedge fund clients are actually tending to be relatively stable or even in downdraft in some cases. And so that works in different directions. So there are some puts and takes within the portfolio that we're always conscious of. I think on management fees, we said the upper end of that range, and I think you can square that with the lower step off in first quarter of 2020 that I mentioned in my prepared remarks.","Trading, I think trading is trading right now. I think you've seen it kind of trend downwards over the last year. I think volatility doesn't feel like it's moving up fast. It's not moving up fast, right? It's stable at best, leverage from hedge funds or from those who borrow or lend in the SEC finance business. If you look at the industry data, it's actually down year-on-year. And I don't see a quick turnaround for that. And so I don't want to gear a business model to an automatic recovery in trading volatility and opportunities to find wider margins and so forth.","And then there's our software and processing fee other line, and I think we've given good, clear guidance on Charles River. And like you say, you just have to be careful about the annualization of the processing fees and other. I think just this quarter, processing fees and other were up about $25 higher than would have naturally been expected than a year ago quarter-over-quarter. And if you look at the full year, I think there's that or even a little more in full year 2019 than in full year 2018. So you may want to think about annualizing either both 2018 and 2019 or even look back to 2018 just because there's a range of possibilities there.","James Mitchell","Okay, all to the point, appreciate the color. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Your line is now open.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Great, thanks. A quick question on the guidance, you did mention that there was changes in leverage ratio coming forward, SCB could also be coming through, has any of that been that factored into the guidance or if those came through positively, that would all be incremental to the guidance you gave?","Eric Aboaf","Brian, it's Eric. Oh, that's a hard question because if I answer it, I'm going to show all my cards, and I can't show all my cards. I don't know what the CCAR cards are going to be like. And so that's a tough one. I think what we do now is we know the amount of capital returns last year. We have some amount of view on this coming year, but we're still guessing. And so I -- it's -- I think what you should probably do from a modeling perspective and what we would expect you to do is think about the capital return levels that we've been at last year as at least a starting point. I'll let you take a swag if you wanted to add a little more or not at that. But at least start with last year as I think that gives some earnings accretion to the EPS line because of the retirement of shares, and that should factor into your estimates in our -- that does factor into your estimates presumably in our guidance.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then separately, when you mentioned the pricing headwinds in 2020 of 3%, is 3% the new normal? Or do you still expect that to go back towards the 2% level of a headwind that has been historically?","Eric Aboaf","Brian, it's Eric. That's a hard question to answer now. I think we'll have a better sense of that later this year in 2020 because what we will get to is where are we with clients with whom we need to adjust pricing in 2017 and 2018 or '16, some of those. They tend to be 3-, 5-, 7-year contracts. There'll be some that start to come through. I think there'll be some balance of trade discussions with those clients. There'll be some different types of deals we do in 2020 and 2021. Think about the front-to-back deals have kind of a different patina to them, whether they come with more middle office or sometimes with a broader array of services that may not factor in differently.","So I think it's just early to tell. I will certainly, I'm sure at this point next year, give some kind of indication for 2021. I think we'd like it to come back down to 2%, but we don't want to build a business model to that right now, which is probably why we've been so emphatic about notwithstanding the fee growth that we're expecting this year that we continue to want to reduce expenses in this plan.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Great, thanks. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Michael Carrier","Thanks, just a quick one for me. You mentioned in the quarter some market-related adjustments in software fees, curious just what that was and if material and then in the 1Q fee outlook, what was the client mix item that you highlighted?","Eric Aboaf","Sure. It's Eric, Mike. Let me take the first part of that. On the market-related items in the software and processing fees, there are several -- the larger ones are tied around the asset management business where there are kind of two underlying activities. There's an activity where we seed funds with our own capital. And obviously, if those funds do well or if there's an equity market uptake, you tend to have a positive mark-to-market because they're effectively on our balance sheet.","The second one is we've got some compensation programs that tied -- that are tied to different investment vehicles. And because of how the accounting works those, and again, tied, it's, I think, relatively typical in asset management because the way the accounting works is you tend to have a mark-to-market effect and an accrual effect, but they tend to be at -- in different time periods. And so in appreciating markets as we had this year, they tend to be positive. In falling markets like we had at the very end of fourth quarter of 2018, they were negative, and that's why we have a big swing. Those are the -- there are a couple of other smaller ones, but those are the lumpy items that we just effectively need to live with.","Ronald P. O'Hanley","Mike, it's Ron. I'll pick up the second part of your question there. There -- we have a very large client where we do -- we have a comprehensive asset management relationship with them and like lots of other -- it's a large corporate. As it's derisking, it moves from risk on type of assets, which have a higher fee to fixed income and liability-driven kinds of investments, which have a lower fee. And this client happens to be large enough that it will be meaningful, assuming it takes place as we expect sometime in early 2020.","Michael Carrier","Alright, thanks a lot. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Michael Mayo","Hi, I have one question that addresses the headwind and one for the solution. So first, in terms of the problem pricing pressure, which you addressed, you said it's gone from 4% headwind to 3% headwind, maybe not 2%, but a little bit better. I guess isn't some of that improvement due to the runoff of low-margin BlackRock? And if you have assets to be installed equal to 3.5% of AUC, is that why you are conservatively guiding for 1% to 3% fee growth? And if the pricing pressure is really abating on a core level, why is that?","Eric Aboaf","Mike, it's Eric. I think there are a couple of different pieces there on the pricing pressure. I think we try to be real distinct in our -- certainly internal analysis, but also our disclosure around pricing pressure relative to other drivers of the fee -- the servicing fee line. So the other drivers are net new business, which would include client transition or added business. There is -- we talked about flows and activity, which have been relatively modest. And then we talk about markets. So we talk about the different buckets consciously because it helps us better manage.","And I think if you go through some of the description that I gave, the fee headwind, we do expect to be lighter from 4% this past year-over-year. In 2020, we expect it to be closer to 3%. I think we do expect some market uplift in 2020. That's in contrast to effectively no market uplift in 2019 if you look at the averages and you look at the averages around the world and average those. And then on net new business, which would include some of that, either added clients or the occasional transition out, we do expect that, that would be a bit positive in 2020 based on some of the last year of significant wins. And in 2019, to your point, it was actually flat in effect, and that was because of that client transition. So that's a little bit of a compare and contrast.","Ronald P. O'Hanley","Mike, on your question on fee pressure itself, maybe the better way to describe it is we see the effects of the pressure abating. I mean at some level, clients, of course, want to have the best fee proposition that they can. We've gotten better at managing that, and we've gotten better through the addition of additional services like Charles River and the Alpha platform of being able to respond to a fee reduction with a -- with either a consolidation of business, offsetting new business, a deeper and broader share of the wallet.","So maybe the way to think about it is there's always ongoing fee pressure. And at times, that's higher or lower, but it's always there. In the meantime, we've gotten better at managing it, both in terms of how we actually go about managing, but also in terms of the additional services that we can now bring to bear.","Michael Mayo","And then part of the solution to that, as you've mentioned, is getting more efficient, reduced headcount 4 quarters in a row and really technology. So I know you just hired a new Chief Technology Officer, but if you could just give some sense of your technology priorities last year. Tech spending, I guess, went up 4% to $2.1 billion. Where do you expect the tech spend to go?","And I know I've asked this. I asked this at the Annual Meeting last year, but you ended the decade with a 26% pretax margin and it was 29% when you first converted to the cloud. Just -- and this predates you, Ron, predates you, Eric. But when you look back at that and you say, okay, what are you going to do different the next few years that you maybe should have done or State Street should have done earlier last decade?","Ronald P. O'Hanley","So there's a lot in your question, Mike, and let me try and answer it efficiently. The focus last year was on, firstly, being ruthless in our prioritization of what was important and trying it much more closely to the needs of the business, firstly, our clients; secondly, what we needed to do for our operating model; and thirdly, what we needed to do for ongoing -- improving ongoing operational resiliency. We're very careful about the incremental investments we make, what we need to make incremental investments.","That has set us up. That -- if you will, the actions we took in 2019 have set us up now to be focused on what we think are the right priorities. We let go some personnel that we felt just weren't consistent with the priorities that we've set. And now what we need to do is just get better at executing those priorities. We feel we've got a plan in place to do that. So what we told you is that you've seen our historic growth. Our intention is to bend that expense growth just like we've bent overall expense growth. We'll do that through a combination of continuing to reprioritize. The gross impact of that will be reasonably high, but it'll be offset by the investments that we need to make to continue to be positioned the way we want to be with our clients. So the net result of that will be a significant arresting of the growth, but we'll probably still be slightly up for the year, is the way I would think about it.","Michael Mayo","Okay. So total tech spend should increase what, like 1%, 2%, any numbers or just a little bit higher?","Eric Aboaf","No, let me just clarify. We were very clear in December that our tech spend has been, this past year, 2018 to 2019, has been up, right, and up way too high in the high single digits at the 8% to 9% range. And our plan this year, which is factored into the outlook, is to have tech be flat to down 2%.","Ronald P. O'Hanley","Yes. And that would be done, which I think is important to understand, through just like we manage overall expenses there'll be some gross reduction in tech spending, offset by a lower amount of tech investments to get us to a flat to slightly down kind of spending.","Michael Mayo","Got it, alright, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Robert Wildhack","Morning guys. Ron, in December, you highlighted some hiring to target growth in the asset owner space. Can you talk about the competitive dynamics in that business and any differences from the asset manager side? And is that something you're emphasizing as a real strategic priority in the near and medium term?","Ronald P. O'Hanley","So Rob, we are emphasizing that as a priority for a couple of reasons. Firstly, lots of the capabilities that we have are increasingly relevant to that space. The asset owner space in the distant past was much more of a custody only, maybe a little bit of accounting. And increasingly, asset owners of typical large and medium asset owner, firstly, is some form of an asset allocator. And in many cases, they have their own investment activities, alongside what they're doing with third parties. So it lends itself to the array of services that we have. The cycle time on them tends to be a little bit quicker, but it's a different selling cycle. If it involves public, it's a very prescribed selling cycle. So it's something that we believe we can leverage a lot of the capabilities that we have. And it's not like we're not present in that business already, but we believe there's opportunity to grow share as those -- that segment needs more and more of the distinct capabilities that we have.","Robert Wildhack","Got it. And then on the asset management side, there's obviously been some consolidation in the e-broker space. And I believe there was some speculation that this could have an impact on distribution of State Street products. Do you think that's the case? And maybe more generally, can you discuss how you're thinking about your distribution strategy as that landscape keeps evolving?","Ronald P. O'Hanley","That's a good question. And there's -- I think that, that's -- we're still in early stages in that. I mean at one level, it leveled the playing field for distribution. So for those that were, in some way, sharing revenues are paying to be on platforms when it goes to 0, you don't write checks anymore for that. So it's -- in some cases, for us and others, we're not the only ones that's reduced our expenses. But it's also -- it's harder to get -- it's harder to pay for now a distinctive positioning. But we do think it will cause is -- with, if you will, transaction fees, no longer the primary criterion by many investors, we believe that it's going to -- that it should enable us to point investors to what they should be focused on, which is liquidity of the product, the true cost of moving in and out of the product. And we've got -- and despite a range, we've got some of the most actively traded products out there. Very liquid. In some cases, deeper and more liquid than the underlying assets. So we think this is an opportunity for us to actually focus on the liquidity side, the importance of that for our investors. But early, early days in this.","Robert Wildhack","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning Ron and Eric. Ron, can you share with us -- you talked earlier about business wins, and there's been a whole mix of different products that you succeeded with this past year. Can you talk to the front-to-back business wins which is new because of Charles River, what types of customers are you seeing grab on to that type of full array of products, is it a completely new customer, or is it no existing customers that are now willing to give you that opportunity to go front to back?","Ronald P. O'Hanley","Gerard, the pipeline is -- we're pleased about the pipeline, is that it's a true mix of clients. We would have expected that our existing clients are a client where we had a large position already, and therefore, in daily conversations with them would be interested in this. And that certainly has played out. And in most of the instances kind in 2019, there were some existing relationship. But what's been particularly gratifying is that we have in the pipeline and working very much through them towards what we would expect to see mandate signed in 2020 or early 2021. Clients where we had no relationship or just a very, very minor relationship where they see the advantage of being able to have a platform, and it might be all State Street products or might not, but a platform that integrates it all there and give them the ability to reengineer their own business model.","It's led to, as I said earlier, a -- just an entirely different set of conversations with clients. It's not about we'll do custody for you at a fraction at this point lower than your guide, and it's much more about what are you trying to achieve in your business, [indiscernible]. Interestingly, as you'd expect, some of the clients in the pipeline are those that are challenged by the environment. Others are those that are already winning in the environment and are trying to figure out how they're going to be able to scale for the next 5 or 10 years. So it's a rich mix of clients, and we think has a -- just a very, very large potential for us as we go forward.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then maybe, Eric, I know there's been a lot of talk on the call about the pricing pressure that you guys have seen, it went up to 4%. Now it seems to be coming in a little bit, and you talked about the mix of your business, repricing, which may be contributing to the reduction. Can you talk to the pricing competition, though? Are you finding that your competitors are less price competitive than maybe two or three years ago or has it really remained unabated?","Eric Aboaf","Gerard, it's Eric. I think it's actually a mix of competitors, in some cases, and clients and others that actually drive the pricing headwinds. And so if you think about it, we are the largest of the providers, so the asset manager segment in the U.S. and around the world as a custodian and fund accountant. And I think it's those clients, the asset manager clients, in particular, that have actually borne the brunt of some of the challenges in the investment industry. And so in some ways, we're near to the bull's eye of where there's disruption in the investment industry, and that's been why I think we've been disproportionately impacted. It's kind of the effect of having that larger share position.","I think we've always seen competitors come in and out of our industry, certainly, those in the other segments, our MBS, of our position, asset managers, but I don't think it's as much a competition-driven change. There's always some of that, but I don't think it's as much of that. And I tell you, for every large competitor that's in the ascent, there's a large competitor who's beginning to fade and focus on other areas, or sometimes there's a small disruptor coming in. There are other small players deciding that there are other areas to refocus. So I think a little more client-driven than otherwise.","Gerard Cassidy","Well thank you and appreciate the time that you spent on the call. Thank you. ","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over to Ron O'Hanley for closing comments.","A - Ronald P. O'Hanley","Thanks very much, everybody, for your participation and your interest.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"20492":["State Street Corp.

Ostler - SVP & Global Head-Global Investor Relations","Thanks, Stephanie. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, who will speak first. Then Mike Bell, our CFO, will take you through our third quarter 2015 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.statestreet.com.

This is a change from the current practice of the fourth Friday of the month, following each quarter-end. This is due to how the calendar works in 2016 and 2017. As a result, we currently expect to release our 4Q 2015 results on Wednesday, January 27, 2016.","Additionally, please save the date for our 2016 Investor Day, which is currently scheduled for Wednesday, February 24, at the Mandarin Hotel in New York City.","Now, let me turn it over to Jay.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone. Our performance in the third quarter was impacted by the sharp decline in global equity markets, including a more pronounced decline in emerging markets. While I'm not pleased with the negative effect on our earnings during the quarter, I do believe that over the long-term our relatively higher exposure to global equities in emerging markets will benefit us.","In light of the continued challenging environment, we are accelerating our multiyear plan to further digitize our operating environment and create cost efficiencies. The plan follows on our successful Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. We are targeting savings that are in the range of approximately $500 million when fully implemented over a four- to five-year timeframe, which is similar to the duration of our recently completed Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. Mike will provide additional details on our plan in his comments.","As many aspects of the new regulatory landscape are taking shape, we're moving aggressively to position ourselves to comply. An example of this during the quarter was the significant progress we made in decreasing excess deposits on our balance sheet. Despite the market environment during the third quarter, we were able to advance our core business, growing operating basis fee revenue by 4% and 1%, compared to the nine months and quarter ending September 30, 2014, respectively and adding $141 billion of new servicing commitments during the third quarter.","We continue to emphasize returning capital to our shareholders. During the third quarter of 2015, we purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock and at quarter-end had approximately $1.1 billion remaining on our March 2015 common stock purchase program, authorizing the share of up to $1.8 billion of our common stock through June 30, 2016.","Now, I'd like to provide a brief overview of economic and market developments and how our business is affected. Concerns about global growth became more acute in the third quarter of 2015 with declines in emerging market growth rates, notably China, further degradation in commodity prices, and even the previously solid economic performance in the U.S. showing signs of hesitation. Equity markets became more correlated as a result.","Gyrations in Chinese equity markets, which had been ignored earlier in the year, began to impact markets more broadly. Global equity markets posted their worst quarter since the third quarter of 2011, which was exacerbated by double-digit depreciation in many emerging market currencies, reflecting investment outflows from those markets. A modicum of calm has recently returned in October following the Federal Reserve's September decision to not raise interest rates amid weaker global conditions and accompanying financial stress. With the risk of deflation returning, investors now question whether U.S. monetary policy tightening will begin at all this year.","Together these events and trends impact our business in several meaningful ways. First, the lower equity markets have caused our assets under custody and administration and assets under management to decrease. This decline in assets combined with the associated risk-off sentiment has resulted in lower fee revenue. Second, the low interest rate environment continues to negatively impact our net interest revenue and net interest margin. This is in part driven by our higher-yielding portfolio investments maturing or experiencing prepayments. And then those funds being reinvested in lower-yielding investments.","Now, I'd like to discuss our Asset Servicing and Asset Management business. We added $141 billion of new servicing commitments during the quarter across all sectors and geographies. New assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods totaled $195 billion at September 30. And we continue to see deep and diverse pipelines.","Our Asset Management business experienced net outflows of $29 billion during the third quarter of 2015, driven primarily by net outflows of $42 billion from institutional mandates, partially offset by $10 billion of inflows to ETFs. The significant drivers of passive equity outflows include rebalancing and cash needs of some of our clients due to lower commodity prices, which is a continuation of a trend that we saw in the second quarter, as well as an expected redemption from one large client.","The SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF, which is an active equity income ETF launched in partnership with DoubleLine, has gained further momentum. It has attracted $1.2 billion in net flows post-launch and now ranks as the most successful ETF launched in the U.S. this year. Additionally during the third quarter, we launched another 13 new ETFs, bringing our year-to-date new launches to 22.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike, who'll review our financial performance for the third quarter, and then we will open the call to all of your questions. Mike?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I will comment on significant items, which affected our third quarter 2015 GAAP basis results as highlighted on slide four.","First, we recorded an after-tax charge of $47 million related to severance for targeted staff reductions. This measure was taken to better calibrate the company's expenses to the current environment and will involve a gross and net worldwide reduction of approximately 600 and 200 positions respectively. We expect these staff reductions to be completed by the end of 2016 with projected expense savings of $50 million with approximately 75% of the savings to positively impact 2016 results.","Second, we recorded an after-tax gain of $49 million from the sale of commercial real estate acquired as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. And lastly, we recorded a tax benefit of $59 million related to a reduction of an Italian deferred tax liability as a consequence of our European legal entity restructuring activities.","Now, I'll refer to slide seven for a discussion of our operating basis results for 3Q 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which I'll refer to as year-to-date. The 3Q 2015 results primarily reflect the challenges from the declining global equity markets and persistently low market interest rates, as well as the seasonal decline in securities finance in comparison to the second quarter. 3Q 2015 EPS of $1.16 decreased from 2Q 2015 and from the year-ago quarter. Year-to-date EPS decreased slightly compared to the same period a year ago.","Importantly, compared to the year-ago period, year-to-date total fee revenue increased 3.7%. 3Q 2015 total fee revenue increased 1% from the third quarter of 2014 and decreased 3% from 2Q 2015, primarily reflecting the adverse market conditions. Compared to the year-ago period, year-to-date fee revenue was negatively impacted by $212 million from the stronger U.S. dollar, largely offset by a similar benefit in total expenses.","Regarding capital, in 3Q 2015, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock. Lastly, we're pleased that we made progress on a key priority to reduce the level of deposits on our balance sheet.","So moving to slide eight, year-to-date fee revenue increased 3.7%, while expenses increased 2.8% versus a year ago. On a constant-currency basis, year-to-date fee revenue increased 7.2%.","Turning to slide 10, I'll discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for 3Q 2015. Servicing fees were down from 3Q 2014, primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower international equity markets, partially offset by net new business and higher transaction volumes.","While the EAFE equity index was down approximately 7%, our 3Q 2015 servicing fees were particularly impacted by the 15% sequential decline in emerging-market average daily levels. We estimate that approximately 10% of our servicing fees are tied to emerging markets.","3Q 2015 management fees decreased relative to a year ago, primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, lower performance fees and lower international equity markets. Total trading services revenue in 3Q 2015 increased from 3Q 2014 due to the higher foreign exchange trading revenue, reflecting higher volatility in volumes. And compared to 2Q 2015, trading services revenue increased due to higher direct foreign exchange trading revenue.","Securities finance revenue increased from 3Q 2014, primarily due to new business in enhanced custody, and was lower than 2Q 2015 reflecting seasonality. Processing fees and other revenue increased from the year-ago period and sequentially, primarily due to the impact of certain valuation adjustments and higher revenue from bank-owned life insurance.","Moving now to slide 11, as you can see, our operating basis net interest revenue continued to be pressured due to the prolonged low interest rate environment and our success in the third quarter in reducing client deposits. The decline in deposits during the third quarter largely occurred towards the end of the quarter, thus explaining the smaller decline in the average deposit balances quarter-over-quarter versus the period end balances quarter-over-quarter.","Now, let's turn to slide 12 to review third quarter 2015 operating basis expenses. Total operating basis expenses decreased slightly from 2Q 2015. Other expenses included a recovery from certain Lehman Brothers claims, which was largely offset by a single securities processing loss of $38 million, which resulted in total securities processing costs for 3Q 2015 of $41 million. This loss was a specific event, and we've evaluated its nature and are implementing control enhancements to mitigate recurrence.","Compared to the third quarter of 2014, compensation and benefits expenses increased, reflecting increased costs for new hires to support new business and regulatory initiatives, partially offset by the benefit of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower incentive compensation expense.","Information systems and communications expenses increased over both periods, reflecting increased cost to support new business and additional data center capacity. Other expenses increased from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to higher professional services fees, including costs to support regulatory initiatives, as well as higher securities processing costs, partially offset by the third quarter 2015 Lehman recovery and lower charitable contributions.","Turning to slide 13. We note that we continue to reposition our balance sheet. The size of the average investment portfolio decreased by approximately $9 billion from June 30 of 2015. The majority of the decrease was related to the sale of lower-yielding MBS and ABS, partially offset by the increase in U.S. treasuries.","Now, I'll turn to slide 14 to review our capital position. As you can see, our capital ratios remained strong, which has enabled us to accomplish a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock purchases. At September 30, our common equity Tier 1 ratio under the Basel III fully phased-in standardized approach increased from June 30, principally due to lower credit risk. The fully phased-in holding company supplementary leverage ratio increased to 5.4% on a fully phased-in basis, principally due to our success in reducing client deposits.","Now, I'll address a question that's likely on investors' and analysts' minds, and that's to provide an update on our efforts to reduce client deposits including the total reduction level that we're targeting. Throughout third quarter 2015, we engaged in productive discussions with clients regarding the implications for our balance sheet associated with excess deposits. While overall deposits declined approximately $44 billion during the quarter, some of that reflected a lower deposit spike at the third quarter end. Importantly, excluding the deposit spikes at quarter-end, we estimate that our balances were $30 billion to $35 billion lower at the end of the third quarter relative to the second quarter, and we view this deposit reduction effort as successful.","Nevertheless, it's also important to recognize that the external environment can impact deposit levels in the future. And our average fourth quarter balance sheet will be the starting point for our 2016 CCAR submission. In addition, as interest rates increase, we also expect to see further declines in client deposits.","Turning to slide 15, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook for 2015. Primarily due to the third quarter 2015 steep decline in equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, we likely will fall below the previously communicated 4% to 7% growth of operating basis fees in 2015. The continued strength of the U.S. dollar has contributed to downward pressure on fee revenue growth as well.","Given the weakness in fee revenue, it will be more challenging for us to grow 2015 operating basis total fee revenue at least 200 basis points above the 2015 growth of operating basis expenses. While this quarter's severance action will have an immaterial impact on operating basis expenses within 4Q 2015, overall we do expect that 4Q 2015 operating basis expenses will be lower than 3Q 2015 levels.","For full-year 2015 operating basis net interest revenue, we currently expect to be near the lower end of our previously communicated range of $2.16 billion to $2.22 billion. Our expectation to be near the lower end of the range primarily reflects both the successful effort in reducing excess deposits and continued low market interest rates.","Now, I'd like to add some additional detail to Jay's comments on the next stage of our transformation program to digitize our enterprise. To be clear, our objectives are twofold. First, we intend to make further significant reductions in our cost structure. And second, we plan to digitize our interfaces with our clients in order to deliver more value.","We've decided to accelerate the next stage of this work through the execution of a formal multiyear plan along the lines of the recently completed and successful Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. While we are still finalizing the details of this second phase of work, we anticipate targeting at least $500 million of annual expense savings when fully implemented.","Importantly, the program will likely involve restructuring costs and investments to fully implement the plan and capture the savings, just as the business ops and information technology transformation program did. The specific timeframe and other parameters are still under development and we look forward to providing a further update on our 4Q 2015 earnings call and review of the detail at our Investor Day on February 24, 2016.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Jay.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike. And, Stephanie, we are now available to open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question is from the line of Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. I think last quarter you gave or \u2013 are you declined to give a target on the amount of excess deposits you hope to shed, but you did say you had a range in mind. Was the decline within that range? And what does that indicate about your potential need for incremental preferred issuance? And then I think you said deposits declined $35 billion adjusted for the lower quarter end spike, so where do excess deposits stand now?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Luke, it's Mike. First of all, one clarification before answering your specific question and that is that we estimate that the deposits if you exclude the quarter end spike were actually down $30 billion to $35 billion. So something in that range of $30 billion to $35 billion rather than explicitly $35 billion. But to answer the main part of your question, first, specifically, yes we're pleased with the progress that we made. We did in fact hit the objective that we had for full year 2015 as of the point in time into the quarter \u2013 third quarter 2015.","Now, I would point out in reference to your pref question, the main priority we're focused on here is positioning for the next CCAR. So the 2016 CCAR will likely be our near-term binding constraint and will likely be the most important factor in terms of pref issuance in the near-term. And if you recall our CCAR results from the last go-round, the Tier 1 leverage was our binding constraint and it's likely to be our binding constraint again. So as you can imagine, very helpful to reduce deposits by $30 billion to $35 billion in terms of meeting the near term Tier 1 leverage target.","So in terms of your specific question on the prefs, I do expect that in first quarter of 2016, we'll look at a number of different factors. We'll look at the parameters of the CCAR test. We'll look at the balance sheet for the average fourth quarter 2015 because remember it's not the September 30 balance sheet. It's the average balance sheet over fourth quarter 2015 that's going to be so important in terms of the next CCAR. So, again, maintaining the lower level through fourth quarter is a high priority. But basically, we'll look at all of those things in 2016 and then make some decisions on any pref issuance plans for 2016.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, Luke, let me just if I can since I know excess deposits such \u2013 is a meaningful question and issue in your minds. Let me just open that, widen that question a little bit. We've been on at least a year journey with our customers. And I think what's transpired through that is that, one, we've developed a very accurate sense of what's operational and what's excess. We define who the outliers are, we've engaged in conversation around those discussions. We have helped customers facilitate transition to money funds out of treasury products. And we've used fees in order to encourage the right behavior.","And so regardless of whether we're at where we want to be in the fourth quarter, what's to me more important is that the dialogue is clear and open and we found a lever that is in charging fees on excess deposits, which I believe will allow us to control excess deposits and manage the size of our balance sheet more proactively going forward.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then you provided, I think, a very detailed model-friendly plan with the first phase of the business transformation initiative. I think you said that's forthcoming, but at this point, are you prepared to speak to any detail? What is multiyear plan mean? Will the savings be frontend or backend loaded? Do you anticipate a bottom-line impact? Or is this just offsetting the growth rate of expenses?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me start that, Luke, and Mike can weigh in. As you recall, the business ops and IT transformation program we set milestones and timelines to demonstrate to you that we were getting the saves that we anticipated getting, and we would anticipate a similar kind of layout going forward. We don't have \u2013 we have that detail internally but we haven't translated it into something that we can clearly articulate to you. But let me just again wind that one back because, I think, it will be the source of probably a series of questions during this morning's call. Business Operations and IT Transformation largely created standardization, centralization and we took advantage of lower labor costs.","If you look at business ops and IT transformation, I equate it to 70% of the benefit was gained from, I would say, process improvement and labor cost arbitrage, 30% technology. Now that we've taken that first step, what we announced today is something that we have been planning, but the new news is that we've accelerated given the difficult environment. And largely it involves digitizing that interface for the customers, so everything comes into us electronically.","And then from an end-to-end basis, as information flows into us on the front end, it flows all the way through our systems without human intervention, and then out the other side for data analytics purposes. So in this next phase, I think the mix is more like 70% or 80% technology-enabled automation, and 20% or 30% process and\/or labor arbitrage. So I think \u2013 I'll hand it over to Mike in a minute, but we will, beginning fourth-quarter call and then more extensively at the February 24 Investor Meeting, walk you through the plans, the details, the milestones and what you should look to us for on a periodic basis for updates. Mike, do you want to add anything to that?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, it was a complete answer, Jay. The only piece, Luke, I would add is we are working through the details here, so this would be the pacing details. This would be the details around the required investments and likely charges. I know that several of you are going to be interested in what does this mean for full-year 2016? So it's really \u2013 that level of detail is what I'd, as Jay said, we're working through those specifics right now in the format that I know you're interested in. So that's the piece that'll be forthcoming at fourth quarter and also at the February Investor Day.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","Hi, there. I guess just a follow-up to that is the markets can move up and down and as we've seen already in October, markets are up 8% to10%. So curious on a sidebar, how much do you think of the weakness in third quarter you might already have recouped some of that benefit in October if markets stayed here?","And then the second part of it is much more important is similar to Luke's, how much of it falls to the bottom line. Should we be, is an easier question or harder question to ask you, where should margins be for your business? In other words, down to 28.9% is below where you've been historically with these various cost programs, ops and IT and now this one. Is there a goal to be riding at a certain level? Like how are you going to measure profitability for yourselves in the next couple of years?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Glenn. It's Mike. Good morning. First on your first question on the markets, it's certainly a positive that markets have rebounded month-to-date here in October. I would point out just for completeness that emerging markets now are pretty close on a month-to-date basis back to the third quarter average. They had really dipped in late September, and what's particularly important to us is the average over the whole quarter. So I would \u2013 I'd hesitate to try to claim any kind of victory based on the first three weeks of October, and obviously we've got another couple months to go. But I would agree with you that it's certainly been helpful to see the equity market positive news on the first three weeks of the month. Jay, do you want to talk about the?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, let me attempt to take that one on, Glenn. The digitization plan which we're announcing today of approximately $500 million in savings over a four year to five year period should obviously help our ongoing goal of annual operating leverage. And all else equal, will improve the margin. If everything else was held steady, the margin would improve. We all know that markets are markets and rates are rates and we don't always control that, so in addition to demonstrating for you that this change will improve the margin, the other thing that we look at, probably more importantly internally, is we look at unit costs.","When you apply technology to a manual process, we've got excruciating detail around the unit cost of all of the activities that we conduct and when you apply technology and reduce labor, couple things happen. One, you improve quality of the customers, you reduce risk, the operating risk that we talk about today. If you're automating, you're not going to have that kind of stuff. And importantly to all of us here, it reduced costs. So for me, it's looking at the unit costs and making sure that we're reducing those unit costs steadily over time. But again, everything else held constant, the margin should improve.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","Understood. And it is a small thing, but is the $50 million in annualized savings from the head count actions you took part of the $500 million, or is that a separate?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That is separate. That is explicit to this quarters actions we took. The $500 million is incremental to the $50 million.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, Mike, for you on the NII front. So on an ex-rates basis, if we're at the kind of low end of the $2.16 billion, we're exiting the year just above maybe $510 million on NII in that circumstance. I think \u2013 I guess if you could just help us understand as you look ahead on an ex-rates basis when would you anticipate NII starting to stabilize out? I know the NIM will be a function as we saw this quarter of the excess deposit flows here and there, but when you're thinking about net interest revenue dollars, how do you start to think about seeing that through on an ex-rates basis?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Ken. Good morning. First of all, it's largely dependent, Ken, as you can imagine, on what happens in terms of market interest rates, which will be tied very closely to what the Fed does in the near-term in terms of potentially increasing the administered rate.","To focus on two different scenarios, if you'll recall at our Investor Day, we had said, look, if you exclude the excess deposits and assume that the Fed funds rate would ultimately get back to 2% and the U.S. Treasury at 10 years would get back to 3.5%, we would expect that the NIM, again, importantly, excluding the excess deposits, would be in the range of 150 basis points to 160 basis points approximately four years after the Fed stopped increasing those rates.","Now again, there's a lot of assumptions in there, and all things equal, of course. But that gives you a sense that it could take a while, but it could be a meaningful increase because that 150 basis points to 160 basis points would compare to something in the low 120s basis points today on that same basis. So again, a fair amount of upside that would way more than offset the loss of the NIR from the excess deposits.","Conversely, that low 120s basis points could fall to something like 95 basis points to 100 basis points, if you recall at the Investor Day presentation, if interest rates stayed static. So again, unfortunately, a fair amount of downside if rates stay exactly where they are. So it is a relatively unpredictable period, Ken, so I think it would be fair to say in net, it's too early to give you a specific thoughts around calendar year 2016, but in net, there could be continued grind if we don't get help on market interest rates, but we could get help over time if we could get some help there.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. One follow-up on expenses. You're asked about this a lot, just underlying regulatory cost inflation, which has been a big burden of this year. Again, aside from the program, the $50 million to $500 million, what's your line of sight to at least seeing kind of the core rate of growth of expenses starting to slow, or are we still on the upward escalation part of that part of the spend?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Ken. The way I think about it is in really a couple of different pieces. First of all, I would remind you that we're in a service business, so as we add additional net new business, as we have for 2015, I would expect that we'd have to add expenses to service that revenue. But obviously, we expect to get positive operating leverage on that additional revenue. So net-net, the revenue more than pays for the additional expenses.","You're absolutely right, the burden that we have faced here in 2015 and also in 2014 was related to the regulatory and related priorities, and that expense came both in terms of adding full-time staff but also outside consultants. As we've talked to you about before, we do anticipate in Q4 and also in 2016 making more progress on replacing those outside consultants, which are very expensive, with additional full-time staff. And just as we've gotten better in terms of process improvement on these priorities, I think we get more efficient and smarter at how we're spending the money.","So again, that's been upward pressure in 2014 and 2015. I think we'll be more productive in 2016. I still would anticipate, I wouldn't put a number on it at this point, that 2016 regulatory expenses would be higher than where they ended up for 2015 just based on the overall environment and the higher regulatory expectations worldwide. But I don't think we'll see the magnitude of increase and certainly we're working through the budgeting process to try to limit that year-over-year increase to something less than what it's been here in 2015.","And then the only last comment I'd make and then see if Jay, wants to add anything is around we will continue to make additional efficiencies. We've made progress on that in 2015. The severance charge that we're announcing today is obviously, another near-term step, and then as we've laid out today, the significant focus on this multiyear plan to get the next tranche of the transformation savings.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I don't have anything to add, Ken.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Jay.","Operator","Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I just wanted to dig in a little bit to the deposit strategy and I think it's great that you were able to bring the deposits down. I just wondered, you mentioned client conversations. We've seen the front end of the curve in the auctions and treasuries, go for zero rates. So I'm guessing that's part of the strategy to increase, move deposits or excess cash out maybe to the treasury market. But I'm just wondering what other kinds of discussions or conversations you're having? And how much did the pricing change that you discussed last call impact your success? And do you see pricing continuing from here to have a positive impact on your balances?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me take that one up, Betsy. As I referenced before, this is, I think, probably the most important thing we did was had an extended conversation with customers making sure they understood through our eyes what was excess and what was more burdensome from the capital return standpoint. Once we got there, the customers, they get it. They understand the capital pressure. So it was really then more a matter of what's the execution plan. We had some vehicles within State Street that we're able to utilize to offload or relieve some of those excess deposits. They also chose to use other vehicles.","I think the pricing, which I would say in Europe ratchet up three or four times and the U.S. less so, was us feeling our way to determine at what level of cost to the customer for excess deposits, it created the right behavior. So the most important thing was transparency and openness of discussion, facilitating and helping them with alternative strategies for excess deposits, and then reinforcing that with the pricing mechanism, which I think ultimately that combination of things leaves us in a place where our customers appreciate and understand what we're going through and are trying to help us solve the overall issue. And leaves us with, I think, a mechanism in place, i.e. pricing, that should allow us to, within reason, manage the size of our balance sheet.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And do you feel like this is the beginning and there's a lot more to go? Or that you worked really hard, obviously, on this for a while, so you've optimized as much as you think you can optimize with your clients at this stage?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think I would say that, importantly, what we've done is establish some, I'll use the word control or some ability to influence those deposits. And as Mike mentioned, we set our target, which we achieved that target. I think going forward, the size of the deposit base and the burden on the balance sheet will be dictated by CCAR or other internal processes, our view of rates. So we think we're in a pretty good place right now not only from a standpoint of where deposits are but reiterating the importance of how we got there.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. So you're not really looking for that much more shrinkage from here?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Not at this point.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. Good morning.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","So I just want to summarize what I think I heard. You're missing your targets for operating leverage and fee growth for 2015. There's a lot of reasons: lower rates, lower markets, lower dollar, lower EM, and higher regulatory costs. And part of the solution is to accelerate the plan to digitalize the operation. So if my understanding is correct, why a total of perhaps five years from now to get the benefits from the plan? I understand you won't tell us all the details until January, but we're talking I guess, the end of 2020 for some of these benefits. And can you reassure us that you guys have a sense of urgency after having less than ideal operating leverage this year?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me start that, Mike, and then Mike can jump in if he chooses. I'd separate those two comments. I mean they're broadly related, but we set out a 4% to 7% revenue growth rate and 200 basis points at the beginning of the year, conditioned upon a certain set of market and rate environment. And as Mike reported, we haven't thrown in the towel on the 200 basis points. I guess that's important to say that we have probably a realistic view of the fourth quarter from a market standpoint. And we believe it's going to be pretty challenging to get to the bottom end of that 4% to 7% growth range. But we are turning over every rock in the fourth quarter to attempt to hit that 200 basis points. We're just saying it looks like a stretch as I sit here today.","Related but separately, you know as well as anybody the business ops and IT journey that we went on, and I think you have an appreciation of the foundation that set for us. Digitization is the next logical step in that journey. And we had the digitization plan, but in light of the continued downward pressure on the environment, I've decided that we're going to accelerate that forward, we're going to put more emphasis, more resources on it and get to that $500 million quicker than we would have had we not. When 70% of the improvement is technology-driven, there is some gate for how quickly you can go but what we're saying is we are going to make it the highest priority in the organization to accelerate that plan. And we think that it will have the attended benefits of cost, which we're all interested in. But it's also going to accelerate our ability to deliver data analytics products to our customers as we streamline the internal data flow within the organization, reduce risk, and reduce operating loss.","I think what we're saying is tough third quarter based on the environment, haven't given up on our goals for 2015, but given our overall outlook for the environment, we're moving forward a plan that we had in place anyway to accelerate our ability to reduce costs. Mike, do you want to add anything?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Mike, I would just add that, remember, this is built off of the backbone of the IT and ops transformation program, which I think everybody would view as being very successful. That also was a multiyear plan but the fact that we were able to meet the interim as well as the full program objectives there, gives us a lot of confidence that we can do the same for this next tranche.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","And then just one short follow-up. On page three of your slide, it says long-term shareholder value and it gives long-term goals, certainly not for this environment. Might you have to reconsider those long-term goals at some point?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Mike, I would say that we'll certainly each year continue to look at the long-term expectations that we have for this business. For now, certainly \u2013 and we went through this, if you recall, at our last Investor Day, we do believe that those goals are achievable as long as in particular that we get some help in terms of a return to more normal interest rates and the other items that we talked about at \u2013 backing those goals back in February.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Just maybe a quick question on the SLR. As you pointed out, a lot of the deposit declines came at the end of the quarter. So as we look to 4Q, since the SLR denominator is based on an average, if I do the math right, based on your indications, does that add \u2013 should we expect that that adds, all else being equal, around it seems like maybe 40 basis points to the SLR next quarter?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Jim, it's Mike. Yeah, certainly your arithmetic is in the ballpark. I would remind you that the \u2013 that implies that we continue in terms of those, the lower levels of deposit through the entirety of the average of fourth quarter, and also that nothing else materially changes. But again, subject to those caveats, your arithmetic is on the money. We'll get the benefit of the drop in the deposits in September, we'll get the full benefit of that in Q4 as long as it's maintained.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. So when we think about the conversation around preferred, you're reticent to kind of say that it's off the table, it's just because you don't know how it progresses from here. If we see another spike in the balance sheet, that might be a different discussion, but given that you could be getting much closer to 6%, it seems like there's a clear guide path to above 6% over the next couple of years. Is that a fair comment?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Jim, yeah, I'd split it up into two pieces. First, your comments are fair as it relates to the SLR, and in fact, we've said all along that we are confident that we're going to be in compliance with SLR, which doesn't kick in until 1\/1\/2018, and that we'll be on a glide path to get there. So, yes, I continue to feel positive about our longer-term compliance with SLR.","I would reinforce, though, Jim, what I said earlier, and that is near-term, the most important binding constraint is not the SLR, it's the upcoming CCAR test, and specifically based on our experience last year, it's the Tier 1 leverage calculation in the upcoming CCAR that's likely to be our near-term binding constraint.","And I'm sure, that's going to be impacted by our Q4 balance sheet, but it's also going to be impacted by the parameters of the CCAR test. We don't know what those are yet, obviously, and we'll have to investigate those parameters and put it through our own capital management modeling.","So there are just a lot of other things that \u2013 beyond the longer-term SLR compliance that could go into a decision in 2016 around prefs, and I just, I \u2013 not knowing those parameters, I can't say definitively, but obviously we plan to give an update here in \u2013 at the beginning of 2016.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, folks.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Jay, just to take a step back on the business ops transformation program and your digitization program, just big picture, I guess, moving from the former program where you certainly had a technological lead versus your peers, and then to this program, is this something that in your mind was an evolution that you thought would have to happen even several years back, or is it more in a response to an increasingly competitive environment?","Of course, BNY advanced their technological move a couple of years back, post the integration of Mellon, and just trying to get a sense of the competitive environment that's causing this versus how you feel about your leadership position?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, let me give that a shot, Brian. The \u2013 I think it represents the inevitable endgame for this business, which is increasingly what we do even though we value some of the operational activities and pricing that we do at the end of the day. The value that the customer sees is the information and analytics that gets derived from all of the data and accounting that we do internally here. And that is impeded today for everybody by multiple systems, breaks, handoffs, reconciliations which causes an inherent delay in the information which lessens its usability. So not far into the future, I think we end up being the organization that delivers upstream analytics to portfolio managers, to risk managers, to compliance managers that provide that real-time insight into the information we hold on behalf of our customers. So that's where the puck's going.","I think everybody is grappling with this in different ways. We have the good fortune, you could say good fortune or good management, to begin with common systems. And so the common systems that we had going into the business opts and IT transformation program allowed us to look at the common processes, which are many, go through a lean or Six Sigma type analysis, optimize those processes, form centers of excellence, leverage places like Poland, China, India for a low-cost location. And that's where we are today. So we run common systems. We've got common processes. The next leg of that is to automate from an end to end basis when a trade comes into the organization, all the way through and out the back end. How that marries up with where the puck's going is that if you can do that, then that information becomes real-time \u2013 all the processing that goes on and the information we deliver back up to front offices of our customers \u2013 is much more valuable than it is today.","And if you were to visit with any asset owner, any asset manager, and ask them what's on their top three list of challenges today, it's aggregating data on a real-time basis for insights, for portfolio management, risk management, and compliance. And we aim to be the organization to get there. And you can't get there unless you take these steps that I just outlined. And I would say from a standpoint of where we are from a leadership standpoint, common systems, common processes, leveraging emerging markets all over the world. And the next big step is to digitize end-to-end those activities. I think we're out in front of everybody with regard to that. And I think we've got the right vision and view. And this is just saying we're going to further accelerate the execution to make sure that we deliver on an organization that's better situated for where the future opportunities are, and an organization that will continue to be a cost leader from a standpoint of those core activities that we conduct.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's great color. Thanks very much for that. And then, Mike, just some couple of clarifications. Just your comments around the 120 basis point NIM, excluding excess deposits. What type of an environment do you need to get to that? And if you could just comment again. I think I may have missed this. The actual excess deposit level you have now, now that you've got $30 billion to $35 billion off. And then on regulatory expenses, you mentioned the pace slowing in 2016 versus 2015 you think. What was the increase in regulatory costs in 2015 so far versus 2014? Thanks.","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Brian. It's Mike. First of all, related to the net interest margin, the low 120s basis points, Brian, that I was mentioning in answer to the earlier question is approximately where we are right now. So we reported an overall NIM of 95 basis points. If we strip out the excess deposits and some other near-term items on the balance sheets like higher CD levels and look at, instead, the net interest margin on what we believe to be the long-term balance sheet, which includes the operational deposits and, again, more normal levels, we basically calculate a NIM today in the low 120s basis points.","And as I was answering earlier, I think, to Ken's question, that could grind down further by, say, another 25 basis points or so. Or it could increase further or another 30 basis points, 35 basis points or so, depending upon where market interest rates go over the next few years.","So your second question was around the excess deposits. On our historical method for calculating excess deposits, which we've given you now for the last couple of years. We estimate that our average excess deposits dropped for average Q3 versus Q2 by approximately $16 billion. So a drop from $62 billion on average at Q2 to $46 billion on average for Q3. But much like what Jim Mitchell was asking about, we would expect if the deposit level simply stay where they are today, that would drop further in Q4 because we will pick up in Q4 the full average.","Now I cannot emphasize enough, Brian, that that does assume that there is no significant change in the external environment, and we are very sensitive to the fact, for example, that the last time there was a debt crisis we saw a huge inflow of deposits. So there is certainly other factors out in the environment that could change that. But basically, if nothing else changed in the quarter relative to where things are today, we would see another similar type of drop in the excess deposits in Q4.","And then your last question around the regulatory expenses. We declined giving a specific number, Brian, because I just think there is so much art rather than science that goes into estimating all in regulatory expenses. Obviously we track very closely very specific regulatory initiatives like CCAR compliance, but we know that there's upward pressure throughout the organization in terms of first line of defense, second line of defense, corporate audit et cetera, that are \u2013 at least largely a function of the higher regulatory expectations worldwide. So I'd prefer not to give a specific number there.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Good. That's great color. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So another one on the expense program I guess. May be taken another way, but I guess the challenge that a lot of investors have with a lot of these cost initiatives is that when you look at a point-to-point from the time you guys have announced the original program, call it 2010 through the end of last year at least, you know, expenses are up 20%. Granted, the revenues grew as well, but I think it will help us understand what is the embedded core expense growth in your view that is reasonable for you to have in today's current regulatory environment in order to achieve your organic growth goals. Is it 3%, is it 5%, just to kind of get us somewhere, you know, help us better assess how much of an ultimate bottom-line impact we could have from this program? Thanks.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me start that, Alex. This is Jay. Reflecting on your math from where we ended up the last program, I think the winds we've been sailing into have largely been regulatory expenditures and the grinding down of interest rates, which have affected net interest revenue I think. I don't have the math in front of me. And I think if you took those away, then you know \u2013 so we would \u2013 you know you can take your own view on where we are on the rate cycle. As Mike indicated, we think we are at least bending the curve on the regulatory cost growth going forward. And if you isolated those two things, it's the operating leverage thing again, and the service business, you are always doing new things for customers, some of that requires expense to do that. But I would point to operating leverage and\/or, if you are able to hold those other variables constant, margin improvement. But, Mike, what would you...?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I would add, Alex, that first of all Jay is right. If you adjust for the higher regulatory expenses and the lower net interest revenue from the grind in interest rates we have in fact expanded margins along the lines of, actually a little more than the $625 million that we reported as IT and ops transformation. So the only piece I would add to Jay's answer is that I think importantly, Alex, is the relationship between the fee revenue and the expenses. So, and we've talked about this before. In an environment where fees are growing at 5% say, and again, there's some help from markets in there, there's some help from flows in there, there's some help from market-driven revenues like FX trading revenues. Then we do in fact expect to have that outpace our expenses in a normal period of time.","Obviously, that is measured over a longer period of time than just one quarter in any given quarter. For example, Q3 was a good example of that where there is a sharp contraction in markets, particularly like we saw in emerging market equity levels then that relationship won't always hold. But again given the success also we had with the first IT and ops transformation program, I would hope that we built credibility with you in terms of our ability to translate these kinds of programs into our overall margins all things equal.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. So just to paraphrase, more normal environment the operating leverage on the core business ex-rates. We should still think about in that 200 basis point spread and then layer on the savings on top of that?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I wouldn't quite jump to the 200 basis points because again, I think that was a 2015 objective. Which did include by the way some productivity benefits, which have helped us offset some of the upward pressure on regulatory expenses.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got you. Okay. And then, Jay, just a question for you on the excess deposits again. You alluded to some levers outside of just price increases. Any way to specify, I guess, what those were and the magnitude of the benefit that you guys got from those additional levers when it comes to the $30 billion, $35 billion number?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Alex, I would say that, I mean, if you would call them levers it's probably three things. Its full transparency with customers with specificity around our objective, which translating into from a customer standpoint, they don't always know what excess is. So by putting some point targets that we're trying to solve for is point one. Point two is, second set of levers is what buckets do they have or we have to shed some of these deposits. So some of those are our buckets whether it's money funds, some of those are their buckets whether moving into treasuries or other vehicles.","And then the third part of the package is making sure that there's a fee incentive, which reinforces the right behavior that was not dropped on someone, but was introduced in a very measured way over time. So that the customer has the ability to help us manage our collective issue and I say that's the story. And I think going out at the way we went at it, I think was the right way to go at it. And it's more likely to create a more sustained outcome.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thanks so much for taking the questions.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Adam Beatty with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate the detail on emerging markets exposure and the asset servicing business. Another area of the market that had challenges has been energy and commodities. So I just want to get your thoughts, maybe not specific figures around areas of the business where there's asset servicing or asset management that might be exposed to energy and commodities. And whether that's had an impact so far? Thanks.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I guess the only thing that I can think of, Adam, maybe by the nature of my hesitation here is it's not much. But I think about commodities and in particular, oil and some sovereign well funds that have downward pressure based on a $45 to $50 a barrel oil pricing and the need to continually fund ongoing operations. That's probably the place that it binds mostly. And I would say it's a discrete set of customers and important, but I'd say in the overall scheme of things, our exposure to commodity prices directly is not that material.","Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, Jay. These days not much a pretty good answer there. Turning to asset management and the growth of that business, you've introduced a lot of new ETF products. Just wanted to get a sense of which market segments and channels you're targeting to gain share. And maybe an update on the overall strategic plan with Ron O'Hanley at SSGA? Thanks.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Let me start with ETFs and then I'll broaden it out. Our ETF strategy is, you know, we've come from a place where most of our \u2013 originally our business was more institutionally oriented and we're moving to a more retail oriented business, which requires that you hire wholesalers in those country and intermediaries in Europe in order to distribute that product. And we've made pretty big investments over the last 18 months to 24 months to increase our distribution salesforce in the U.S. And we're doing something similar in Europe. So the strategy is multifold. One, it's to \u2013 in addition to the institutional world orient towards the retail world, and with that, bulk up our distribution. And that distribution would be to financial planners, advisors, broker-dealers, private banks.","And then the other leg of the strategy is really around on the product side. So you noted in the beginning of your comment that we've introduced quite a few products. The orientation of the new products that we're bringing to market have the characteristic of less pure beta, more involved strategies and therefore higher fees. So the one that I spiked out in my comments was the product we did with DoubleLine. We have several other products, one with Blackstone, bank loan fund. So we're orienting towards maybe more sophisticated and higher-yielding products.","And the last point I would make is we have been open and continue to be open to package somebody else's investment expertise in our ETF structuring here and distributed through the distribution force that I just mentioned. I guess if I broaden the question out, the other main emphasis of the SSGA's strategy that I would put a bright light on is the whole solutions world, which for us 401(k) has been a big area of success over the last couple of years. Ron has a big history on that. And even more broadly just Packaging Solutions for not only institutional, but the retail world, And we think with our combination of beta in many flavors, ETF's vehicles, that we're well positioned to succeed in both the ETF and the solutions world.","Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's great detail. Much appreciated.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Jay, I just wanted to shift the conversation to your third pillar of your long-term plan. How will you be investing for growth during this program? Are you able to size the data and analytics opportunity you noted today? And are there any other revenue opportunities that could emerge from 2016 digitization plan?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I appreciate the question. Broadly, we have been \u2013 even though we don't talk about it a lot on these calls. We haven't lost our way with regard to continuing to invest in things that will be the future growth drivers of the business. The one I like to point to, enhanced custody. Four years or five years ago, a vision that took a couple of years for it to incubate. And now, as you know, it's driving most of the growth in our securities lending business. That's one example. There are several examples around.","But if I go to the third pillar of the strategy, the data and analytics business, which we launched I think two years ago now. There are several strategies that we're focused on there. At the core, it's this data aggregation piece. So if we're dealing with an asset manager or an asset owner, the ability to aggregate up data not only our own data but data from other sources through a data warehouse, cleanse it, make sure that it's available real-time, is the foundational stage of that business.","And then on the back of that, risk tools. We recently introduced a stress testing tool for fund products where it's really a big data application where we see subscription and redemption history. We know the characteristics of the underlying funds. We can predict or allow a customer to predict how much liquidity is required given the likelihood of redemptions.","Interestingly, the SEC and increasingly the other regulators are leaning into the asset management industry to get more sophisticated about liquidity stress testing and fund products. So that converges nicely with that. That's just one example Ashley, but it's clear as day to me that the future is going to be defined by who wins that space, who can digitize their data and who can develop those analytic products that are the value-add to customers in addition to all the custody and operational activities that we conduct.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks for the color there. And then, Mike, as you intensify efforts to reduce these deposits, apart from NII, should we be thinking about any other revenue impact as clients adjust? And then also, how are you addressing the $20 billion or so nonoperational hedge fund deposits?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Ashley. First, on the revenue side, at this point, and I acknowledge that things can change in the future, at this point, I don't expect other second order impact from the deposit actions other than the lost NIR on the excess deposits themselves. So at this point, again, we're not expecting, for example, to lose client relationships over this. Although, again, it's something we're very sensitive to and that's why we've taken the measured approach that we have.","And as it relates to the hedge fund and private equity deposits, as we've talked about before, while historically, a chunk of those have \u2013 we've considered to be operational deposits because they are in fact a part of the normal operations and part of the custody relationship. And we do believe to be sticky, they don't count under the LCR rules as being operational deposits.","So a portion of those we've seen decline, so a portion of the excess deposits for those clients are included in the deposit reduction that I've mentioned. But as you would expect, a portion have remained sticky, and we do expect that they will remain sticky going forward. And we'll continue to look at the all-in economics of those relationships, but expect them to be sticky.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. I guess final question: does this in any way change your view of alternative asset servicing and attractiveness of that business?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, it does not. But we view that as a very attractive segment.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Jay and Mike, I just want to follow up on Alex's question, so the whole thought process of can we see this benefit come to the bottom line. You talked about the fact that \u2013 Alex mentioned the revenue is up as much as expense is up, and you talked about the fact that you were hurt by NIM, but rates are coming down, which is fair.","But on the other hand, Jay, you also have a huge benefit from equity markets. I mean, if you look from 2010 onwards, your S&P 500 went from 1,250 to, even just go to the end of second quarter, over 2,000. Your NASDAQ almost doubled from 2,500-plus. So if we don't have that kind of huge market tailwind, should we still like \u2013 should we be able to expect to see this? And on the expense side, while you \u2013 obviously, regulatory expenses were a surprise. There is businesses \u2013 investment costs that have to go in too. So could you add some more color to that?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Vivek, it's Mike. First of all, you're asking the kinds of levels of detail that we intend to cover as part of our Investor Day presentation, and I suspect we'll give some overview on the Q4 call. So I just think it's better laying out the entire plan to then talk about some of the specifics around things like equity market help or the market interest rate environment. I think that's better handled over the course of a multi-hour Investor Day than on this call.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And Jay, how much of this digitization \u2013 since you're doing \u2013 this is coming over five years. How much of this is more what I would think of as business as usual because the world is changing, we're going to more passive assets, more ETFs from active, and so this is just needed given that you've got obviously, lower fees coming on the other side, as opposed to just given that it's such a long timeframe? How much of that is more that \u2013 whatever's coming anyway that you had to...","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I \u2013 in some respects, Vivek, it doesn't matter the asset type, the asset class, the geography. To me, it's really reflective of this pretty cumbersome western world financial landscape that we've created. What we're talking about enhances the value of a passive fund, an alternative fund, a private equity fund. If we can move things through here without human touch it benefits everybody. To the point of \u2013 this is where the world is going. Not just financial services. Everybody's looking to digitize their environment and it's hard to do.","And I think that \u2013 I think we have a huge benefit and that we're a large global company, but we've laid the foundation long ago, common systems, common processes to get there first and this, today's announcement is really a reflection of needing to pull it in so that we can get there first because of the, somewhat, the environment which puts pressure on cost. So I think it has the intended benefit of cost saves at the same time, it accelerates our product strategy and should make us more valuable counterparty to our customers.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question is from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Hi. It's Geoff Elliott from Autonomous Research. Thank you for taking the question. The singular event that you talked about driving up processing expenses, what was that?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'd rather not go into a huge amount of detail, but it's fair to say that we did have a processing error related to a significant once in many, many years, maybe a decades kind of class action situation. And so as a result, of course, we reimbursed the funds that were impacted so that it was our loss, not theirs.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, Geoffrey, I'd just say that the losses or gains get extreme scrutiny around here, not just to \u2013 there are two things to figure out what happened but also to make sure that it can happen again. And so we take great pride in our record of low operating losses. So when an event like this happens, we turned the place upside down to make sure that everybody understands what happened and why it won't happen again.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","And then on the $500 million, I know you're still kind of working through the fine detail, but can you just explain how you get to that number? Is it a bottom-up exercise? Is it a top-down exercise? Just to kind of get some comfort around the ability to deliver on that without giving us all of the information you're going to work through at the Investor Day.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Geoffrey, this is Jay and Mike can add to this. It is very much a bottoms-up exercise. We have hundreds of people and hundreds of work streams that are looking at \u2013 I'll take the simple one, when an electronic trade comes in, that end-to-end process how many breaks are there in it, what technology needs to be applied, what process needs to change in order to affect what outcome. We have measured the breaks, the outcomes, the cost saves, the people, the systems, so it's in a lot of detail. And very much bottoms-up. You can't just dictate top-down a number and expect that people are going to figure it out. So we've spent the better part of a year in doing the analysis that leads to today's announcement. Mike, you want to add anything?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Geoff, what I would add is that remember this does build off the backbone of the IT and ops transformation program. So one of the infrastructures that was created as part of that is as we move to, for example centers of excellence and as we did the detailed process improvement at work from that program. As Jay indicated, we got very specific, very granular on our unit cost for providing different services along the chain. And as Jay indicated, the $500 million stems from a review of those different links in the chain, if you will, and how much we expect to save through critically applying additional technology to those various links. Again, the piece that is specifically we're going to focus on over the next three months will be the pacing and sequencing.","So again, I know several of you are interested in, well what does that mean for 2016? And that is work that we need to do some additional vetting around. And then there will also be some additional investment cost, restructuring programs et cetera that we've got some additional detail to build up as well.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Great. Thank you very much.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude the Q&A session for today's conference. I will turn the call back over to Jay for any further statements or closing remarks.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks, Stephanie. I'd want to thank, everybody, for their questions and attention today, and we look forward to speaking with you after the fourth quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.

This call may not be recorded for rebroadcast or distribution in whole or in part without the express written authorization from the State Street Corporation. The only authorized broadcast on this call will be housed on the State Street Web site.","Now, I would like to introduce Anthony Ostler, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at State Street.","Anthony Ostler","Thanks, Therese. Good morning and thank you all for joining us.","On our call today are Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley will speak first. Then, Mike Bell, our CFO will take you through our first quarter 2016 earnings by presentation which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our Web site, www.statestreet.com. Afterwards we will be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit your questions to 2 questions and then requeue.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include operating basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measures are available in the appendix to our 1Q 2016 slide presentation.","In addition today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements, actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today, in our 1Q 2016 slide presentation under the heading, forward-looking statements and in our SEC filings including the risk factor section of our 2015 Form 10-K.","Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. As with the past couple of quarters, we have instituted a new pattern of releasing our financial results on the fourth Wednesday of the month following each quarter end. As such, we expect to hold our second quarter earnings call on Wednesday, July 27 2016.","Now, let me turn it over to Jay.","Jay Hooley","Thanks, Anthony and good morning, everyone.","Despite the challenging environment, I'm pleased with the progress we've made during the quarter on the five strategic priorities I outlined for you at our Investor Day in February. These priorities will help us to transform State Street, compete in the new environment and deliver value in the short-term. As a reminder, these priorities are, one, to become a digital leader in financial services, to drive growth from our core franchise, to invest in new products that will enhance revenue and drive differentiation, increased our focus on expense management and leverage our strong capital position to continue to return capital to shareholders.","As you can see on Slide 4 of the slide deck, we've outlined for you highlights of our progress so far this year against those five priorities. First, on becoming a digital leader in financial services. We are investing in becoming a digital leader in financial services through State Street Beacon; our journey to digitize core processes will deliver an enhanced client experience and generate $550 million in annual pretax net run rate expense savings by the end of 2020.","Our clients are already begin to see the results of our investments through faster and more consistent delivery of services impacting our clients operations and driving improved ranking within distribution channels. We are also actively engaged in evaluating new technologies such as block-chain.","We remain on track to achieve State Street Beacon related annualized run rate savings of $100 million by the end of this year. That amount will be reflected in our 2017 results. As we indicated could be the case at our Investor Day, we did take a pretax restructuring charge of $97 million in the first quarter related to Beacon.","Second, we expect our core franchise to continue to deliver growth given our leading positions and attractive markets. Although our first quarter fee revenue reflects a challenging market environment experienced at the beginning of the year, we are encouraged by the signs of stability in March and the strength of our pipeline across the firm.","The first quarter included new asset servicing wins of approximately $264 billion, but approximately $400 billion of service commitments remaining at quarter end to be installed from current and prior periods.","I want to highlight when that our Global Services Group in Asia Pacific recently finalized. In early March, we were selected to be the master custodian for Australia's third largest superannuation fund, First State Super. This new relationship will also extend into globe markets and our global exchange businesses. Of note, State Street now services four of the seven largest superfund and what is the high-growth sector for us in Australia.","I'm also pleased to say that our asset management business has inflows of $13 billion with expected annualized net new revenue of $11 million during the quarter providing the strongest quarterly net flow in annualized revenue results since the fourth quarter of 2014. That activity was driven primarily by $7 billion of inflows into ETFs and $11 billion of inflows into cash products.","Third, we believe continuous investment in new products and solutions will enhance revenue and drive differentiation. Our recent agreement to acquire GE Asset Management supports our strategy to invest in higher growth and return businesses. GE Asset Management significantly enhances our position in the outsourced CIO market, which is one of the faster growing segments of the asset management business.","Additionally, GE Asset Management expands SSGAs alternative capabilities, while enhancing our active equity and fixed income teams, which broadened the solution sets we can provide to our combined client base. Most importantly, GE Asset Management is a high-quality organization with strong cultural alignment with SSGA and this transaction is an endorsement of our ongoing and strong long-term relationship with GE.","We expect this acquisition to be accretive in the first 12 months of operation. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate products that are not meeting our strategic or financial expectations. We made the decision during the quarter to exit our futures clearing business, at the beginning of the second quarter we completed the sale of the WM\/Reuters branded foreign exchange benchmark business to Thomson Reuters. These and other ongoing return on capital actions are aimed at improving our efficiency, strategic focus and ROE over the medium to long-term.","Innovation is a critical differentiator in the competitive ETF segment and a key focus for SSGA. Our SSGA, our spider ETF business introduced 13 new funds during the quarter including the SSGA gender diversity ETF. She is the first self indexed ETF, and its development was inspired by CalSTRS efforts to move the needle on gender diversity in corporate America and seeks to track performance of the SSGA gender diversity index which comprises large -- U.S. large cap companies with the highest levels within their sectors of gender diversity on their Board of Directors and in their senior leadership.","Fourth, we are increasing our focus on expense management. Our results this quarter reflect our commitment to manage expenses with first quarter operating expenses flat compared to the same period a year ago and also flat excluding the seasonal impact of equity compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.","We continue to make expense discipline core to our culture encouraging employees to embrace and owners mindset and identify ways we can reduce cost across the enterprise looking at everything from travel to consultant spend.","As I noted earlier, State Street Beacon is contributing to our expense management efforts and we are on track to generate at least $100 million in annualized pretax net run rate expense savings this year from the program.","And fifth, we're leveraging our strong capital position to continue to return capital to shareholders. Our first quarter 2016 common stock dividend was $0.34 per share and we purchased approximately $325 million of our common stock. We expect to repurchase up to $390 million of our common stock in 2Q 2016.","As I've just reviewed for you, we will continue to focus our attention and effort in 2016 on our strategic priorities. We expect this will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective of generating positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2016.","Two weeks ago, the Fed Reserve and FDIC released their review of our July 2015 RRP submission. Both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC noted that we have made improvements over our prior plans, but determined that our 2015 resolution plan is not credible. While disappointed with the findings, we are committed to addressing the issues and enhancing our resolution plan as our business and regulatory requirements evolve.","We've had ongoing communications with the regulator and are focused on addressing all the deficiencies jointly identified by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC by October 1, 2016.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike, who'll review our financial performance for the first quarter and then we'll both be available to take your questions.","Mike Bell","Thank you, Jay. Good morning, everyone.","This morning before I start my review of our operating basis results, I like to note that our GAAP basis results for the first quarter included pretax restructuring costs of $97 million related to State Street Beacon including the exit of our Futures Clearing Business.","Now turn to Slide 8 in the slide presentation for a summary of our operating basis results for 1Q 2016. 1Q 2016 results reflect softness in our fee revenue primarily driven by lower global equity markets, partially offset by strong expense control. Operating basis EPS for 1Q 2016 decreased to $0.98 a share from $1.16 in 1Q 2015 and decreased from $1.21 in 4Q 2015.","Our first quarter results in 2015 and 2016 included the seasonal effect of deferred incentive comp for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. Importantly, total expenses were approximately flat compared to the year ago quarter. And excluding the noted seasonal retirement eligible expenses and payroll taxes, total expenses were approximately flat compared to 4Q 2015. Regarding capital in 1Q 2016, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased approximately $325 million of our common stock.","Moving now to Slide 9, 1Q 2016 fee revenue decreased 3.6% while expenses were approximately flat versus a year ago. Weakness in global equity markets and elevated 1Q 2015 FX revenue resulting from the Swiss National Bank actions at that time contributed to the decrease in fee revenue relative to the year ago quarter.","I'll now turn to Slide 11 for a review of our 1Q 2016 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees decreased from the year ago quarter primarily due to the lower global equity markets and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar partially offset by net new business. The decrease in the international equity markets particularly in emerging markets negatively impacted first quarter servicing fees. Compared to the year ago quarter, average daily values for the Morgan Stanley Emerging Market Index decreased 22%, while the EAFE Equity Index was down approximately 12%.","Management fees decreased relative to a year ago reflecting global equity markets and net outflows partially offset by lower money market fee waivers. Foreign exchange revenue decreased from the strong market activity in 1Q 2015 due to lower volatility in volumes nevertheless that increase relative to 4Q 2015.","Securities finance revenue increased from 1Q 2015 and 4Q 2015, the increase over both periods reflects increased revenue from both enhanced custody and agency lending. Compared to 4Q 2015 processing and other revenue decreased reflecting lower equity earnings from joint ventures and lower revenues associated with tax advantaged investments.","Moving to Slide 12, I would note that our operating basis, 1Q 2016 net interest revenue benefited from the higher Fed funds rate and disciplined liability pricing. Debt interest revenue decreased from a year ago primarily driven by the successful reduction in the size of our balance sheet.","Now let's turn to Slide 13 to review 1Q 2016 operating basis expenses. Importantly total operating basis expenses were well-controlled in 1Q 2016 and were approximately flat relative to 1Q 2015 a notable accomplishment. Compensation and employee benefits were impacted by the seasonal deferred incentive compensation for the retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes, demonstrating solid expense control the other expense category decreased significantly as compared to both 1Q 2015 and 4Q 2015. Compared to 4Q 2015 over other expense were driven lower professional services fees and travel expenses as well as the settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Now, turn to Slide 15 to review our capital position. As you can see our capital ratios remain strong, which has enabled us to accomplish a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock purchases. Compared to December 31, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased under the Basel III fully phased in advanced approach and remained approximately flat under the standardized approach.","Importantly, the March 31 fully phased and supplementary leverage ratio at the bank increased to 6.2% primarily due to an increase in Tier 1 capital. We repurchased $325 million of common stock in 1Q 2016 and expect to repurchase up to $390 million in 2Q 2016, this will put us approximately $65 million below our gross share repurchase program of $1.83 billion. The $65 million difference represents the reduction in our 1Q 2016 equity compensation for our employees relative to what we've expected at the time our capital plan was approved. The net repurchased amount is therefore consistent with the capital plan.","Moving on to the next Slide. Let me briefly discuss our agreement to acquire GE asset management. What remains a top priority to return capital to shareholders through common stock repurchase and dividends, we also are focused on allocating capital to higher growth and return businesses. The agreement to acquire GE Asset Management reflects this plan. The purchase price is $435 million subject to adjustments with up to an additional $50 million tied to incremental opportunities with GE.","Excluding merger and integration charges, the transaction is expected to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the first 12-month period following the close of the transaction and we're targeting a client asset retention rate of at least 90%. Importantly, the acquisition will significantly enhance State Street's position in the fast growing outsourced chief investment officer market.","Moving to Slide 17, I will now provide an update to our 2016 financial outlook. Despite the pressure on global equity markets in the first quarter, we are encouraged that the environment improved in March. Importantly, compared to January and February, servicing and management fees improved in March.","On the expense front, we continue to expect operating basis expense growth of up to 2% for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015 with variability across quarters. We also continue to expect to generate positive fee operating leverage relative to 2015. Please note my comments related to our 2016 outlook exclude any potential impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management. Also, we're on track to generate at least $100 million in estimated annual pretax net run rate expense savings from State Street Beacon by the end of 2016.","Now as a reminder, upward pressure on regulatory and compliance cost is expected to continue throughout 2016. However, we expect the growth rate to be lower than full year 2015 relative to 2014. We also expect expense growth to be affected by the volume of new business as well as continued investments. In addition, we continue to have two scenarios for 2016 net interest revenue largely consistent with prior communications. The first scenario assumes market interest rates remain static at March 2016 levels. Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in a range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion.","The second scenario assumes administered rates in the U.S. increased 25 basis points in both June and December and correspondingly market rates to trend higher from 2016 levels. Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in a range of approximately $2.1 billion $2.2 billion. We continue to expect the 2016 operating basis tax rate to be 30% to 32%. And lastly, I would emphasize, that returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends remains a priority.","Our 2016 capital plan remains subject to the results of the 2016 CCAR process including a review from the Federal Reserve Board.","In summary, although the revenue environment remains challenging as reflected in 1Q 2016 results, we are encouraged that fee revenue gained momentum in March and we remain focused on prudently managing expenses and providing solutions to our clients. Let me turn the call back over to Jay.","Jay Hooley","Thanks Mike. Therese, we are now available to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao [Credit Suisse].","Ashley Serrao","Good morning.","Jay Hooley","Good morning.","Ashley Serrao","First question just on expenses and Beacon, I'm curious what the run rate benefit to 1Q results was?","Mike Bell","Ashley, good morning, it's Mike. In Q1 as compared to Q4, so on a sequential basis, we had net savings of approximately $7 million. And we had noted that the Investor Day that we did expect a fair amount of spending for Beacon and we had that but as I said the net savings in Q1 was approximately $7 million sequentially.","Ashley Serrao","Okay, so still fairly early innings there. Okay. And just two, and if I look at net interest revenue this quarter and the sequential jump in NIM, what drove the increasing yields on the other asset bucket?","Mike Bell","I would point to a couple of things. And I wouldn't characterize it, Ashley, as just the impact on the other asset bucket, but there were a couple of things that broadly helped us. First of all, as we've discussed before, we have a significant amount of our balance sheet that is in floating rate assets. So that's a combination of the Central Bank deposits that we have here in the U.S. That includes the floating rate securities in the securities portfolio about half of the floating rate securities are in U.S., so that's approximately $18 billion.","And then, we also, our loans tend to be also a floating rate asset. So basically the floating rate assets in our balance sheet increased, as you would expect, based upon the increase in short-term market interest rates.","In addition, we also were able to capture a wider spread on client repo and we also saw increased netting for repos. So those two things combined increased what you see on the average rates earned and paid page that increased significantly the average rate for the assets that are in the repo securities category.","Ad then, in the other interest earning asset line that you specifically ask about, that's our enhanced custody asset and basically that just reflects the market rate increase as a result of short-term rates being higher.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin [Jefferies].","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Just -- one more follow-up on the NII front then Mike. So, do you normalize for some of those helpers because if I take what you're saying about that and just think about the fact that you've left the -- without rate band unchanged, it would seem that even to get down to that high-end of that X rate span, you're talking about more like a 5, 10 type of net interest income run rate. So, can you just kind of help us just walk through how much of that first quarter goes away, and then, the other typical pushes and pulls in terms of any lingering yield compression versus balance sheet shrinkage we should be thinking about.","Mike Bell","Sure, absolutely. Ken, good morning. The couple of things that we expect in the static rate scenario, Ken, the couple of things that we expect to put downward pressure on our NIR under the static scenario would be number one, the grind in the fixed rate portion of the portfolio. So I mentioned that approximately $36 billion of our portfolio is floating rate about half of that is in the U.S. that benefited from the short-term rate hike. About half of that is outside the U.S., which obviously did not benefit from the short-term rate hike. But in the fixed rate category, which is approximately $66 billion of the portfolio, we're seeing this grind where the rate on the investments that are maturing is approximately 100 to 150 basis points higher than the new fixed rate investments that we're making with the proceeds from those maturities. So that grind over the course of the year is a negative.","And as we talked about before, in Europe, the situation is still relatively negative in that not only are the short-term interest rates negative with the ECB, but in addition to that because of the quantitative easing program over there, spreads are really teeny as well. So, the grind in the portfolio in Europe as well is putting downward pressure. So in the static rates scenario, we would expect those to be the big drivers of the lower NIR in the next several quarters. If instead though, we get a couple more Fed fund hikes, we wouldn't expect them to be quite as accretive as what we saw in first quarter, but obviously, we would expect it to be net-net helpful as we get a higher rate on the floating rate assets that I mentioned in response to Ashley's question.","Ken Usdin","Great. Thanks Mike. And just a second question on expenses. Great start on the flat year-over-year, but you're also keeping up to 2% full year into your point about the compliance builds and also the volatility quarter-to-quarter. We are also implying that expenses do have a distinct upward trail from here? Because it would seem like you are on a better trajectory. Why couldn't you do better than that 2% guidance you had given us at Investor Day?","Mike Bell","Yes. First, Ken, I appreciate the compliment on the first quarter results. We are really pleased with that. And as we talked about at the Investor Day, we continue to look at really every signal area of expenses. And I think we did a particularly good job in Q1 at reducing the outside consulting expenses, some of it regulatory, cost some of it not regulatory. We reduced travel expenses significantly in Q1. But, I do expect that there'll be a march up in regulatory expenses in Q2, Q3, Q4 as a result of dealing with the higher expectations.","Now, having said that, we'll continue to look at every area of expense. As Jay talked about, project Beacon continued to be on track for the expected $100 million savings for the full year. But, again, between the regulatory costs and net new business that we expect to be coming onboard that will need expense to service. We thought it made sense to stick with the -- to say up to 2% on expense growth. And obviously, a lot of where we'll end up will also relate to where the fee revenue ends up as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr [Evercore].","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks very much. Two business questions. First one is on enhanced custody and agency lending. You mentioned the wider spreads, or I should say the growth in the higher short-term rates. But, curious on just overall balances in progress of the business, it seems to be growing fast. You talked about it in the past, but what are the goals in terms of how much you want to grow at and what risk -- let me rephrase that, what capital charges go along with growing that business?","Jay Hooley","Glenn, let me start that one. You've seen not just this quarter, but progressive quarter's good performance, out performance in securities lending. And you're right this quarter was a combination of agency and enhanced custody. I would say over a longer cycle, it's really been enhanced custody that has driven the disproportionate growth. And we expect that will continue. That continues to be high demand in our -- not only hedge, but in our traditional client base to use enhanced custody as opposed to some of the traditional means of credit. And we don't see much limitation. I'd say most of the business growth that we're seeing quarter-to-quarter it is existing clients doing more credit extension with us. So, we built out the product, I think I mentioned last quarter. We're building it out in Europe and Asia as we would do normally for all of our products. The ability to net the securities lending back against the broader portfolio makes it an attractive proposition from a capital standpoint. So net-net, we've seen continued demand. We don't see much in the way of capacity constraints and we think we've figured out how to make this attractive from return on capital standpoint.","Glenn Schorr","ROE better than the overall company's ROE, I'm just curious if it's driving -- you ever increasing capital ratios or that's just all regulatory\u2026","Jay Hooley","Glenn, it's a little bit less, but I would say steadily improving over the last couple of years.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks, Jay.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Alex Blostein [Goldman Sachs].","Alex Blostein","Good morning, guys. Question on the Living Will issue from a couple weeks ago. You know, what do you guys as far as the next steps go, what do you expect to do to address the issues especially when it comes to the capital concern that came out of their statement? And do anticipate this to have any impact on CCAR for you guys, whether probably not so much in the quantitative piece but more on the qualitative?","Mike Bell","Sure. Good morning, Alex, it's Mike. First of all, I don't view the capital piece, the capital item that was noted as a deficiency as being a significant problem for us to deal with. And I do not expect at this point in time that that would have an impact on CCAR. And obviously, Fed will make the judgments that they'll make, but I have no indication at this point that that would have a negative impact.","So, really what we're focused on now is better understanding the regulatory expectations both for the October 1 deliverable as well as the submission next July 1. And so that more broadly is what we are focus on. And as Jay indicated in his prepared remarks, we are certainly committed to doing everything in our power to meeting their expectations.","Alex Blostein","Got you. And then, Jay, follow up for you on the GE acquisition. You guys talked about pretty robust growth, I guess in that business. But my understanding is that something like 90% or so, CIO versus GE pension assets that are obviously sticky there. But I not sure how growth those are. So give us a sense of what the organic growth has been in that business prior to your acquisition, and then maybe what you guys anticipate to see from again the organic growth part of the business?","Jay Hooley","Sure. Happy to take that one up, Alex. As you point out, a good deal of the assets are GE assets, both their pension which is how the whole thing got started, outsourcing the CIO function of GE's pension assets. But they've also been successful in attracting some other big names in the outsourced CIO marketplace. So I think that if you just look at that segment of the market particularly against an environment were rates are likely to be low for a protracted period of time. We think that's a growth market. And we think by kind of unshackling GE from GE and making it part of the State Street that will be more attractive provider of services in the outsourced CIO market. So they've had some growth on their own, we've also had some growth. By combining it we think we can grow at a faster rate. So that's core to the growth opportunity.","But also core of the growth opportunity is, you've heard us talk before about a natural place where we play very effectively in the asset management world is in solutions. And whether it's a target date fund or outsourced CIO or many other versions of solutions. And we had a little bit of a deficit in several asset classes particularly alternatives. And so again, by taking our natural solutions capabilities and enhancing it with some of GE's very credible asset management components in the alternatives, real estate, private equity and hedge, all three, we think we can accelerate our solutions growth.","So it's really taking, I'd say a very high-quality and stable asset management organization and bedding at State Street and true synergies of the revenue side. And the OCIO and solutions segments of the market.","Alex Blostein","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell [Buckingham Research].","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. Maybe, you could talk a little bit about euro deposits. It sounds like you raised the fee charged on those. Have you seen any runoff that's material or is it a little too early to tell we see that in the second quarter. How do we think about your clients' reaction to raising rates?","Mike Bell","Sure, Jim. Good morning, it's Mike.","Jim Mitchell","Good morning.","Mike Bell","We did as you suggested, we did increase the rate that we are charging for euro deposits. We did see approximately $2 billion of run-off on average Q1 versus Q4. The discussions with clients are ongoing. I would say at this point, it feels like a relatively well-managed situation, but it's something that we're obviously paying close attention to given the challenging conditions in Europe.","Jay Hooley","Hey Jim, let me just chip in something. I would say on this whole charging for negative rates, we were market leaders in that. And as I look across the landscape, we're not alone anymore. So whether it's the U.S. banks, the European banks, the environment has shifted to be supportive of this activity. So I think that helps from a standpoint of being able to raise rates and retain the deposits that we want.","Jim Mitchell","Right. And so it seems like deposits have held in a little bit better than maybe you expect it. Is that part of the upside we see in NII this quarter relative to your full year forecast?","Jay Hooley","Jim, I would characterize it as they are pretty much tracking with what we expected.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. And if I could just ask one on the Tier 1 capital at the bank, it seems like you downstream some capital there. Is that true? How is that accomplished to boost the Tier 1 on the SLR bank?","Mike Bell","Sure. In terms of just administratively how we did it, we basically just retained some earnings at the bank as opposed to dividending that from the bank to the HoldCo. But as we've talked about in the past, Jim, we do recognize that we've got some flexibility in terms of what assets we hold at the HoldCo versus what we have at the bank. So this was really normal management in line with our plan to be sure that we were above 6% in time for 118. Obviously, the fact that the balance sheet got smaller as well was also helpful in that regard.","Jim Mitchell","Right. Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Bedell [Deutsche Bank].","Brian Bedell","Hi. Good morning, folks.","Jay Hooley","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Bedell","Mike, just to circle back on the securities repo line, the yield going from 236 to 586, it's about -- looks like around $30 million sequential increase. Can you just explain that dynamic again and what you would expect the normalized rate to be in the second quarter on that?","Mike Bell","Sure, Brian. Well, first of all, I wouldn't focus as much on the 586 as I would on just the overall contribution from that line item. But again, first talk about the change in the numerator. As we talked about in one of the earlier questions, we did earn a higher spread, a wider spread on client repo in the first quarter. Basically, as short-term market interest rates increased, we were able to capture that in our margin. The thing that makes the average rate jump as much as it did though, is that we also expanded netting in the quarter.","So as a result, we actually had expanded activity for our clients in the quarter, but we were able to net more of it. So the average balance you see there dropped by about $0.5 billion or about 16% sequentially. But it was -- that was really from the netting. So the overall activity expanded. The spreads expanded, but as a result, the average balance been dropped.","I wouldn't say, I think that was a combination of good management and good market conditions. And I would expect that market conditions will remain relatively good in the near-term, but it's something certainly we can't guarantee and it's something that we manage and monitor everyday.","Brian Bedell","It seem as though $30 million, you would view as somewhat or that $30 million increase, you would view as somewhat sustainable or would you see that river back somewhat?","Mike Bell","I think that, again, time will tell Brian. I don't have a perfect crystal ball. But, I would expect that perhaps the majority of the sequential increase in those spreads should be sustained over the next couple of quarters. But again, it will be depending upon market conditions.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. And then, maybe Jay, if you want to comment a little bit about the typical dividend arbitrage season and in Europe there's been some discussion of curtailing that. Are you seeing the same type of activity that you typically see in securities lending and FX trading coming into the second quarter or do you expect that to be a little bit strange?","Jay Hooley","Brian you point out second quarter is a seasonal peak for us with regard to the dividend activity. It's been a lot of attention on that over the last couple of years. So, we probably see some slight diminishment from what we've seen in past. I don't think it's material, but probably not quite at the peak it's been in past years because of all the attention that trade has received.","Brian Bedell","Great, thank you. I'll get back in the queue for some follow-ups. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes Betsy Graseck [Morgan Stanley].","Betsy Graseck","I just wanted to begin on two things. One was on the Beacon project, you indicated the restructuring charge of $97 million this quarter. Obviously, a net savings this quarter of $7 million. I know you're investing $500 million, you're investing $40 million to get a $500 million benefit over five years, but could you give us a sense to how we should think about the investment and the space as we go through the rest of this year? Because I thought it was front-end loaded? So I just wanted to make sure I have the numbers right there.","Mike Bell","Sure, Betsy. It's Mike. I do expect that both the benefits as well as the investments that we're making in project Beacon will both steadily increase over the course of 2016. I do expect that the net benefit will increase each of those three quarters. On the other hand, as I mentioned earlier, I also do expect to see some upward pressure on regulatory cost. So again, that's several moving parts, but I would think in Beacon in particular as both investments continuing to increase and savings continuing to increase.","Betsy Graseck","And all of the $97 million in investment was largely in severance and I'm assuming that's the -- kind of below the net line number. You're not anticipating any investments in the Beacon project to be in operating expenses are you?","Mike Bell","Yes. We are Betsy. In fact, we did see investments in that area in operating expenses that was both in compensation, but it's also in the information systems line. And again, I would expect to see additional spending in the information systems line over the course of 2016.","Betsy Graseck","And then, on your slide, you indicated, obviously that strategic priority to be a digital leader in financial services. Could you just break apart a little bit the one-liner you have there actively testing new technologies such as block-chain? Could you give us a sense as to what you are doing there?","Jay Hooley","Happy to do that, Betsy. This is Jay. Block-chain as we see, it's appropriately a lot of attention and I think it's -- to me it's synonymous with digitization generally. I think if I would've put some perspective on -- put into perspective Beacon and block-chain, I would say that Beacon is our effort internally to digitize within the four walls of State Street. I think that importantly, the whole developed markets, financial services infrastructure needs to be digitized and that's going to require standardization between firms and between activities. So that's really where I see block-chain being most relevant.","We have internally within our Beacon effort, we've got I think it's four, maybe five pilots going on to use block-chain as a means to digitize within State Street, linked to other firms. So let me give you the best example, maybe be the most easily explained example. Bank loan processing has been an activity that State Street has developed a significant share of the market and processing a bank loan requires many intermediaries to come together in a common ledger to exchange information. So we have a pilot going on in our bank loan processing group where we're using block-chain. And we've got agreement from all the counterparties to participate in a block-chain pilot around bank loan processing.","So what that would do is take an activity where there's process improvements and technology that we need to do internally within State Street, but it would extend it to other counterparties. So we've got several of those going on which we think could be helpful to us. I think that probably the bigger comment I would make is that we'll digitize our own environment, but it will require standards across the industry and again, block-chain maybe one of those. We are participating in a group called R3. I think there's up to 16 banking institutions that are trying to figure out what the application -- what the best applications are to use block-chain in order to create standards inter-company, inter-industry.","And so I think we're going to absolutely do what we need to do to digitize our environment. I think the home run here is, if we can get some standards developed around how we will interoperate from a digital standpoint and I think block-chain could be, if it's not block-chain it will be something else, one of the standards that emerged that allow the interoperability at a digital level in the whole industry. I don't know if that confuses or helps, but that's how I view it. We can control, we can control that's what we're doing with Beacon. But in order for this really to work, the industry needs to digitize. Block-chain\u2026","Betsy Graseck","That's helpful, it's just a question of, is it a product by product and what kind of timeframe do you see to potentially take something like the pilot that you're working on to either have a go or no go decision with some benefits to you.","Jay Hooley","Yes. I guess is, it's product by product at this point. And so bank loans is one of those products, one of those services. I'd be surprised if within a year we don't know whether it would be the right answer to that issue. And I think as with many things, if we get a bunch of financial institutions to converge around a problem and use a new tool. if successful, it will grow from there. And I think it's got a decent chance of succeeding. But, it'll be one of many solutions versus the silver bullet.","Betsy Graseck","Yes. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Adam Beatty [Bank of America].","Adam Beatty","Good morning. I have a question about product strategies and ETFs. Appreciate the details earlier. It seems like State Street and others have come out with some fairly niche offerings recently. And the question is with a lot of the big indexes and exposures already being covered including by some State Street products, is that the feature of ETF innovation kind of like television where there is 300 channels, where everybody can see exactly what they want? Or if that's not the whole story, how does that fit into your overall product strategy? Thanks.","Jay Hooley","I think I appreciate the question, Adam I just remind you that our ETF strategy is really two tracks. One is to continue to build out the distribution, which we're doing in the U.S. and also Europe. And then to your point, it's enhancing the product. And I'd say, a lot of the basic beta strategies have been consumed in an ETF product. But then, you get to the next level of customized indexes. So the SHE index that I described in our prepared comments is using a -- is developing a strategy and developed in this case, this is the first time we have self indexed. So we built the index, back tested it, and then, packaged it in an ETF. You'll see more and more of that happening. In fact, we are not the only ones doing that I think in the broad beta and ETF space that's a theme.","The other thing I would say is that I would point to maybe the partnership we have with DoubleLine where they're taking active fixed income strategies. They are the manager, who are packaging it in the ETF and disturbing it. And I think you're going to see more and more encroachment into traditional products basis and I come a little short because I'm not quite sold yet, you'll take active equity products, for instance, and wrap it in an ETF, but others would take the other side of that argument.","So I don't really see much limitation for investment strategies being able to be wrapped and packaged in an ETF structure and distributed to both institutions and the retail market space. So we have, I would say that SSGA has deployed kind of an open platform strategy where if we can create the index in the case of SHE, manufacture and distribute, then we will. But if there's an interesting investment idea outside of SSGA, we're willing to discuss packaging and distributing which we've done not just with DoubleLine but with Nuveen, MFS and several other firms. Hope that helps.","Adam Beatty","Yes, it does Thank you very much, Jay. And then, a question on the OCIO business in the context of asset servicing, how much synergy -- revenue synergy would you expect in terms of asset servicing, and if so in what areas? Is it possible that the GE acquisition benefits from being housed from that standpoint in an organization like State Street ?","Jay Hooley","Yes. I think it's a good question. And one of the reasons we have a 25-year-old relationship with GE is, we've been the back end of the front end OCIO business that GE has run over these years. So I think that as I mentioned before, the Outsourcing of the Chief Investment Officer function for these defined benefit plans is likely to be a growing opportunity, growth opportunity. You're already seeing it today. The fact that we can go in and not only offer the front office expertise of how to run these plans, how to speak the language of DB to trustees and other customer facing, pension organizations, but also be able to fully integrate the back office complete with asset servicing, middle office securities lending everything that goes with it, is all relevant here. So I see the more OCIO business we get it should naturally bring all the middle and back office business with it.","Adam Beatty","Excellent. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. Your question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Hey, good morning. Just one quick follow-up at this point. The decline in other expenses, I think the implication was that you had some benefit here. I think you weighed out the consultant expenses coming down but the reason why the guy didn't go up is because you've got some upward pressure pending from potential Living Will spend and such. Am I paraphrasing that correctly? Am I reading through your comments right or should you, can you clarify please?","Mike Bell","Brennan, it's Mike. I think those are fair comments, but I wouldn't limit the upward regulatory cost pressure to just the Living Wills. I think it's broader than that. But other than that your comment is very fair.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. And then, is there a way to unpack the other expense result here that was better than expected and how much independently you think might be sustainable beyond then the pending upward pressure from here? Is there a way to think about that separately?","Mike Bell","Well, I would just remind you that we're still guiding to up to 2% overall expense growth year-over-year excluding the acquisition of GE Asset Management. So the fact that that's the case, says to me that we are going to manage expenses really in aggregate. And obviously, our preferred route would be to continue to build in-house capabilities, hire full-time people to manage and run these regulatory and compliance activities and rely less and less on outside consultants. And so if we continue to be successful in that area, then I think that line item will likely run below last year's. But again, it really is a question of managing those priorities in aggregate as opposed to just focusing on one line item.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Jay Hooley","Vivek?","Operator","It looks like Vivek withdrew his question. Your next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Yes. Thanks and good morning. Quick question on the GE Asset Management, and I know you gave guidance as to what the expected accretion to be for one year and also you want to retain 90% with regards to the AUM. But, we would assume that the one-year is just because that's when the lockup period is, for those assets or is there a longer lockup on the assets being acquired?","Mike Bell","Brian, I wouldn't relate the two. Basically, we're focused on the first 12 months because we wanted to give you a time period at which we expect this to be accretive to EPS. And so that really is irrespective of any kind of lockup period with the GE plan.","Jay Hooley","And I'd add, Brian that our expectation is that the 90% plus business that we retained will have a long life to it.","Brian Kleinhanzl","So I guess asked differently, when does the lockup period end?","Mike Bell","There is not a contractual lockup period. Basically we're confident that we can continue to meet the GE pension plans needs and that's what we will be focused on.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Thanks. And then, just a second question. What's the impact on the revenues from the exit of the Futures Clearing business, I guess what's the impact on the pretax margin as well?","Mike Bell","Sure. So Brian, the SCM business earned $9 million in fees in full year 2015. And the expenses were greater than that but we are part of the overall savings that I talked about earlier in terms of Beacon. So I wouldn't be more specific at this point.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. On the resolution plan, could you talk about what you need to do their and how much of that is simply around changing the plan versus how much is around making changes in the way business is structured, the amounts of liquidity that you hold, how capital is allocated between different types of fees and so on?","Mike Bell","So, Geoff, it's Mike. I would say it is early days to be real specific on the actions that will -- it will take to ultimately meet the regulatory expectations. You saw the same information that we did in terms of the keeper that lays out expectations for July 1, 2017 submission. And I think we'll be in ongoing dialogue with both the Federal Reserve as well as the FDIC over the next at least 12 months to make sure that we specifically understand them.","So I think it's going to be a combination of all the things that you just described there's likely to be some additional infrastructure to be built. Some of it will be additional modeling capabilities. Some of it will be additional monitoring capabilities and also as you correctly indicated, I would expect to see additional legal entity simplification over time as well. But I really think it's a little bit too early to try to be specific until we have more ongoing dialogue with both groups.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you. And then, just to follow-up on the previous question on the not being a contractual lockup on the GE Asset Management assets, why not -- had a thought that when your acquiring a manager and the vast majority of the assets are in-house, that would be absolutely critical to making sure you don't just get the one-year accretion, but the accretion, three, four, five, 10 years out?","Jay Hooley","I would say, Geoff it's a pension plan, so it has a list of restrictions. If you look at SSG, probably the biggest segment that they manage for our pension plans and they do that and as long as they are fulfilling their return expectations, it's unlikely that that changes. And so, GE has been managing this plan for a long time. These are -- we see in our business, the OCIO market very sticky assets. So I don't frankly view it as -- I view it as not a concern at all as long as we do what we are being asked to do, which we do everyday for many customers around the world, then we think these assets will be with us for a time. And the fact that we are going to combine it with our business gives us more scale and expertise and it will make us the more attractive counterparty for other pension plans that want to outsource that. I view it as a stable, sticky series of assets with some capabilities we don't have today that will allow us to grow the base.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you.","Jay Hooley","Great.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Can you guys share with us on the new business when it's on the net asset servicing side of about $264 billion, what percentage of that was the first State Super Australia win? And then second, what's the pipeline work for the second quarter?","Jay Hooley","Let me take that one Gerard. I can't give you a First State Super, but what I would tell you is that of $264 billion a little bit unusually, 50% of that came from Asia Pacific. So we've been running more probably 60\/40 U.S., non-U.S for this quarter, was more 70:30, 30% being U.S., 70% non-U.S. So good progress in Asia Pacific , really anchored in not only Australia which I highlighted, but we've also seen some movement in Japan where we've seen the first outsourcing of investment trust funds, something we've been pursuing for a long time. So that's the first question.","The second, pipelines are quite full. I think that, I said this before, but if you look at the asset owner and maybe more specifically, the asset management segment, between difficulty and achieving above benchmark returns to increasing regulatory pressure, we've never seen the demand for things like middle office outsourcing that we have on our plate right now. And importantly, in that particular product, there's a willingness to accept standardized services. So I feel very good about the pipeline, not only from a geographic standpoint, but across, in particular asset managers, but asset service -- asset owners as well.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. And then, maybe Mike, when we look at your average balance sheet that give us in the supplement on Page 11. I noticed that the interest-bearing deposits in the United States, the yield on that or the cost, I should say to you guys, jumped from 23 basis points to 40 basis points. And then, quite a bit different than some of your peers. What caused it to jump up that much?","Mike Bell","Sure, Gerard. First of all, the main driver in that category is actually the cost of our wholesale CDs. So we have approximately $15 billion on average of wholesale CD balances in Q1. And those moved with LIBOR rates. And so that's the driver of the sequential increase there. If we strip those out and just at what the interest-bearing DDA that was pretty close to flat sequentially. So it's really the wholesale CDs.","Gerard Cassidy","And the CDs as a percentage of the total that you just gave us, is that consistent with those prior periods? Or is it a greater percentage today than it was in those prior periods?","Mike Bell","It's probably a slightly smaller percentage today at $15 billion. We use the wholesale CDs as a management tool around liquidity and those balances were actually a little bit higher in 2015. I remember the rates were lower because LIBOR was lower in 2015 than what it is in Q1 2016.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of things. Firstly, Mike, just following up on the question you're talking about on the repo market, you said majority of the increasing spreads can be sustained in the next couple of quarters? Can you give us a little more color on what's going on in that market structurally that's causing this widening in spreads and that will sustain it?","Mike Bell","Sure, Vivek. I mean really it's a combination of the fact that short-term interest rates have obviously gone up with the Fed fund hike. And it's also just a function of supply and demand. And so we will monitor those conditions carefully, but I see nothing that would suggest that that's going to evaporate here in Q2. So again, it's something that we will pay close attention to.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Thanks. Just shifting gears, Jay, to look at your asset management business, if I look at the operating margin in the fourth quarter was 13%, and if I look at full year asset management margin was 19 and change, 15% for the fourth quarter and 19 in change, the really low margin compared to peers. You talked a little bit about specifically that business what you can do to first even moving things like ETF, what you can do to accelerate the operating margin improvement and why so far behind peers?","Jay Hooley","Sure, Vivek. I'm happy to take that. We're not pleased with the margin in the SSGA business, I think I said that before. And we do think by reorienting around the strategic priorities that we laid out back in February which are anchored in ETF solutions, OCIO as an additional category that we're getting the right level of focus and investing at the right amount in order to drive really top-line and also create more efficiency through the focus. And I think that if you look over an extended period of time, you would have seen we've hit a trough with regard to returns. And I feel like the investments that we've been making are starting to create some traction. And I look at ETFs and really solutions as being the cornerstone of that.","In addition to some of the positioning we have in markets outside the U.S., again, I would look to those same two cornerstone elements. So we're working on it. We think we're making the right investments. I think focus is important. SSGA in some respects does not have a lot of pure comps given what it does. And we're trying to be very good at a couple of things and do them well globally. And I think we're on the right track.","Vivek Juneja","And do you think it will be sooner in SSGA in terms of -- you're not talking about overall company operating margin improvement, do you see SSGA doing same timeframe or sooner, Jay, compared to the servicing business?","Jay Hooley","I got two views on that Vivek. One is, yes, sooner, because we're making proportionally more investments than the SSGA business. And I think, you also need to come back to one of the comments we made around the GE acquisition. As we look at our different businesses within State Street and look at returns, SSGA has disproportionately higher return as does a businesslike Global Exchange. So as we look at investing in areas that we think have natural growth upside and in addition would be accretive to our return on equity, we are going to proportionally lead in that direction.","And so I think for those reasons, I would expect that you would see SSGA improve sooner than the rest of the franchise.","Vivek Juneja","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And our final question comes from Brian Bedell, it's a follow-up question with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","The assets under administration looks like there was a significant decline in the pension product area from $5.5 trillion to $5.2 trillion. I was just wondering what drove that?","Mike Bell","Nothing, specific Brian. It's really the negative impact of markets that's the big driver there.","Brian Bedell","On the pension side okay. The 6% drop linked quarter, was it all market related?","Mike Bell","I wouldn't say all market related. I don't have that desegregation right at my finger tips. But the main drop in the AUA was in fact from markets.","Jay Hooley","Nothing going on from a loss business standpoint.","Brian Bedell","Okay. That's what I was getting at. Yes. Okay, great. And thanks for that. And then just tax rate guidance, this would imply that would be towards the higher end for the next three quarters given it was 29% for 1Q. Is that fair?","Mike Bell","Yes. I think that's fair Brian. First of all, the operating tax rate that we provide is heavily impacted by tax advantaged investments. And so just based on the seasonal pattern of tax advantage investments, we tend to see the pattern that you're describing. So nothing particularly surprising there and we experienced a similar pattern in 2015.","Brian Bedell","Got it. And just as lastly the -- you talked about the Futures Clearing business, but the impact of the Reuters business, was doing that two times in Reuters and is that suppose to the FX trading line or is that in a different line from the revenue side?","Mike Bell","That's in the -- let's say it's in the other -- it's in the fees line item in brokerage and other fees line item.","Brian Bedell","Okay.

[Operator Instructions] ","Now I'd like to introduce Kelley MacDonald, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at State Street.","S. Kelley MacDonald","Good morning. Before Jay Hooley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Resch, our Chief Financial Officer, begin their remarks, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street's 2010 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC.","We encourage you to review those filings, including the sections on Risk Factors concerning any forward-looking statements we make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, January 18, 2012, and the corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.","I'd also like to remind you that you can find a slide presentation regarding the corporation's investment portfolio as well as our fourth quarter 2011 earnings news release, which includes reconciliations of non-GAAP measures referred to on this webcast in the Investor Relations portion of our website. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.","Joseph L. Hooley","Thanks, Kelley, and good morning. Our full year 2011 results, which include double-digit growth in our total fee revenue and earnings per share as compared to 2010, reflect the strength of our franchise in the face of volatile equity markets and continued uncertainty in Europe. ","In addition to remarks about the 2011 and fourth quarter results, this morning, I'll make some comments about the economic outlook, our continuing success generating new business in our core asset servicing and asset management businesses, the ongoing progress of our business ops and information technology transformation program, as well as our plans for leveraging our strong capital position. ","As we began 2010, like many others anticipated, the first half of the year would be challenging and that the U.S. and European economies would improve in the second half, increasing our prospects for growth. ","After a strong first half, Europe weakened in mid-May and a major rating agency downgraded the credit rating of the U.S., resulting in very challenging and extremely volatile markets in the second half, with the U.S. market recovering at the very end of the year. This second half environment significantly affected investor confidence, and we saw a broad-based derisking of our clients, which put pressure on our servicing and management fee revenue. ","Compared to the third quarter, our fourth quarter revenue for trading services also declined due to the weak environment in the capital markets. Based on the weakening global market environment at year end, we accelerate our expense control program. In particular, our compensation and benefit expenses were reduced by about $145 million or 7%, comparing the second half with the first half of 2011. Part of this reduction is due to the successful execution of our business operations and information technology transformation program and the remainder due to incremental actions we took regarding incentive compensation. ","We expect this weakness in the capital markets to continue into 2012, and so this morning, we announced measures that will result in a further reduction in the run rate of expenses in our capital markets-facing businesses. As part of our annual review of all of our businesses, we also recently announced our withdrawal from the fixed income trading initiative. This decision reflects a number of factors, including continuing market turmoil and regulatory changes both in the U.S. and Europe that likely would have required us to increase capital and expenses associated with this initiative. ","Despite the challenging environment, we continue to add new business to the core franchise. In the fourth quarter, we added about $590 billion in new assets to be serviced and had $109 billion in gross new business at State Street Global Advisors. One notable anticipated departure in SSgA assets was the $41 billion of planned assets from -- planned asset sales from accounts we manage for the U.S. Treasury. ","For the full year 2011, of the $1.4 trillion in new service wins, about $560 billion or 40% were from non-U.S. clients, and of the $109 billion wins in U.S. in SSgA, $39 billion or about 36% were from non-U.S. clients. Among our large and new mandates was AllianceBernstein for investment manager operations outsourcing for more than $360 billion in assets. In addition, we also won a mandate from American Century, which awarded us custody, accounting and fund administration for its '40 Act Mutual Funds totaling about $90 billion in assets. Also, PEMCO renewed its long-standing relationship with us for investment manager operations outsourcing services for assets totaling approximately $1.3 trillion. The state of Washington renewed its agreement with us for servicing and securities finance for $75 billion in assets. SSgA was awarded a mandate to provide fixed income management for EUR 82 billion for the BNL-BNP Paribas employees pension fund, one of the largest pension funds in Italy. ","Regarding the timing of installations, as of December 31, 2011, we had installed $1.1 trillion of the $1.4 trillion in new asset servicing wins this year. We expect to install the remaining $300 billion in 2012. ","In the alternative asset servicing area, demand remained strong. This quarter, we added 38 new mandates in our alternative investment servicing business, and our alternative assets under administration increased from $793 billion as of September 30, 2011, to $816 billion as of December 31, 2011. ","At State Street Global Advisors, of the $109 billion in gross new mandates in the fourth quarter, $20 billion is scheduled to be installed in 2012. We continue to benefit from the concentrated effort to cross sell products between asset servicing and asset management. Illustrating the power of the franchise, 77 of the top 100 clients of State Street are clients of both investor servicing and SSgA. Those 77 clients generated 40% of SSgA's total 2011 revenue. ","Let me now share our outlook for the global economy. We expect G7 economies to grow modestly about 1.5% in 2012, similar to the slow growth experienced in 2011. Additionally, we expect a slowdown in emerging market economies, resulting in weak expectations for the capital markets. All major central banks are on hold or are easing. The potential fallout from the European debt crisis remains as a significant risk factor, and the market remains cautious. Destruction of household wealth due primarily to a drop in housing prices as well as the decline in equity valuations is limiting growth in consumer spending. Therefore, in the U.S., we expect a very slow but sustainable recovery. ","As we indicated when we announced our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program in November 2010, we expected the expense savings in 2011 would be slight. However, when the global economy weakened in mid-year, we accelerated our program, and our total expense savings in 2011, excluding restructuring costs, were approximately $86 million. ","Through this program, we continue to expect to achieve 400 basis point improvement in our operating basis pretax margin compared to 2010 by the end of 2015, all else equal. ","In 2012, we expect to add 2 additional global centers of excellence to balance our global footprint. The cloud computing infrastructure has been installed and is in production. We continue to scale this technology as we migrate major systems through 2014. ","In 2012, we also expect to have substantially completed the transition to the 2 strategic partners we announced in mid-2011. As a result of these activities in 2012, we expect to achieve an annual pretax run rate expense save of $94 million, bringing the anticipated annual pretax run rate expense savings to $180 million compared to the expense rate in 2010, all else equal. ","This program is going to substantially transform State Street, both in terms of service to our clients, more rapid development of new products as well as significant reduction of our expenses. ","I also want to update you on our capital position, which remain very strong in the fourth quarter. We continue to await the capital requirements for globally systemic important financial institutions. At this time, we expect to know these requirements by the end of 2012, enabling us to evaluate the effect on State Street and on our expectations for return on equity. ","In the fourth quarter, we purchased approximately 5.6 million of our common shares, which brought the total shares purchased in 2011 to 16.3 million. This completed the $675 million program announced in March 2011. We also announced a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share in the fourth quarter. We've submitted this year's capital plan to the Fed Reserve and expect to hear back in March. And we continue to prioritize increasing return of capital to shareholders through dividends and our share repurchase program. ","Due to the strength of our capital position, we were able to take these actions while retaining the flexibility to respond to future acquisition opportunities should they become available. Regarding our recent acquisitions, in 2011, we added 2 small acquisitions, both of which strengthen our product capability. Complementa in Switzerland, which provides performance measurement and analytics to asset managers and banks, pension funds and insurance companies, primarily in Switzerland and Germany, and Pulse Trading in the United States, which enhances our electronic trading capabilities by adding an equity crossing platform that we can cross sell to our client base. ","I'll now turn the call over to Ed, who will discuss our results for the fourth quarter, the performance of our investment portfolio and provide additional details on our capital position. Then I'll return to provide some final remarks before opening the call to your questions. Ed?","Edward J. Resch","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. As Jay said, this morning, I'll cover 3 areas: first, the results of the fourth quarter; second, I'll summarize the performance of and outlook for the investment portfolio as well as worldwide interest rates and the impact on our net interest margin; and finally, I'll review our strong capital position. I'll present some of the more significant results first, comparing 2011 with 2010 and then comparing the fourth quarter to the third quarter of 2011. And this morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings news release. ","First, comparing full year 2011 with 2010. The revenue from almost all of our businesses increased. Our servicing fee revenue increased by 11%, due primarily to net new business and the impact of market appreciation, as well as acquisitions. Our asset management fee revenue increased 11%, due primarily to stronger equity markets and the impact of an acquisition. ","Regarding trading services and securities finance. Foreign-exchange revenue increased 14%, brokerage and other fee revenue improved 6% and securities finance was up 19%, due primarily to improved spreads. Net interest revenue increased 6%, due primarily to an increase in lower cost deposits, offset partially by lower yields. ","Our net interest margin averaged 152 basis points in 2011 or 160 basis points, excluding the impact of excess deposits in the second half of 2011.","Comparing the results of the fourth quarter 2011 with the third quarter. Across both our asses servicing and asset management businesses, we have seen investors become more risk-averse, given economic uncertainty in Europe and the continued volatility in equity markets. Investors are shifting from global and emerging market equity strategies into more conservative, lower-risk asset classes, such as money market funds and insured deposits. ","Servicing fee revenue declined 4% to $1.05 billion due to mix shifts and negative flows as a result of investors' risk-averse behavior, the impact of the strong dollar and lower valuations in the European equity markets. To put this decline in context, the daily average valuation of the S&P 500 was flat compared to the third quarter, and the MSCI EAFE was down about 7%. ","The VIX, which measures the change in equity market volatility, was near its historical average at 23 to close the quarter at 23.40 after starting the quarter at an elevated level [ph] 43. ","Similarly, the 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate closed the quarter at about 58 basis points, having begun the quarter at about 37 basis points and averaging about 48 basis points in the quarter. Investors reacted to these worldwide economic events by adjusting their portfolios, thereby affecting the mix of assets under custody as well as investment management flows. ","Investors transitioned from higher-risk strategies, such as those in international and emerging markets, to cash and fixed income. In either case, they remained in our assets under administration, but the revenue was lower. ","Investment management fee revenue declined by 12% to $202 million, due primarily to negative flows and active equities, fixed income and cash. The latter was the result of lower demand and securities finance. The average of the 3-month end valuations as measured by the S&P 500 was up about 3% compared to the third quarter, and the MSCI EAFE was down 5%. ","In total, in the fourth quarter, we experienced $89 billion of negative net new business, which was comprised principally of the $51 billion decline in cash assets and the planned $41 billion redemption by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. ETFs, however, had one of their best quarters, adding about $12 billion in flows. ","While cash assets under management, excluding securities lending cash in the fourth quarter, was about the same as the third quarter, the revenue decline was affected by a mix shift from prime money market funds into U.S. government funds, which reduced revenue. As a result of this shift, we expect our money market fund fee waivers to increase from about $5 million per quarter to about $10 million per quarter should this trend be maintained. ","Trading services revenue declined 18% to $273 million. Foreign-exchange revenue declined 26% to $150 million due to weaker volumes and lower volatility. ","In foreign exchange, for the first time, we are experiencing a decline in indirect foreign-exchange products as this area of the business has come under increased scrutiny. Some clients have chosen to move to electronic exchange, which we offer through our Street FX product or through Currenex, or have decided to transact using our direct services. We have several different ways through which a client may choose to transact foreign exchange with us, and so while the type of transaction may be changing, the clients find one of our other services to be a value to them. ","Brokerage and other fees declined 5% to $123 million, primarily due to weaker transition management revenue. Securities finance revenue increased 6% to $90 million based on an improvement in spreads. ","In the quarter, the 3-month LIBOR to Fed funds effective spread was 40.6. Securities on loan averaged $340 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, down from $368 billion for the third quarter of 2011 and from $368 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010, both declines due to reduced demand. Average lendable assets for the fourth quarter of 2011 were about $2.23 trillion, down 2% from $2.28 trillion, the same level in the third quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2010. ","As of December 31, 2011, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 17 days, up from 12 days in the third quarter of 2011 and flat with 17 days in the fourth quarter of 2010. ","Processing and other fee revenue declined 50% to $45 million, due primarily to the fair value adjustment relative to the positions in the fixed income trading initiative that we are exiting. The large decline from the prior quarter was also the result of $22 million of gains in the third quarter related to real estate and certain leases. ","Net interest revenue of $577 million increased about 2% in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to an increase in earning assets driven by an increase in lower-cost client deposits, offset partially by lower investment yields. ","We continue to benefit from clients leaving additional deposits with us in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, clients left on average about $23 billion of excess deposits compared to $15 billion in the third quarter. The additional deposits contributed to slightly higher net interest revenue in the fourth quarter. An average of $19 billion in increased client deposits was left with State Street in the second half 2011 compared to the first half. ","Including the excess deposits left with State Street in the fourth quarter, operating basis net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 140 basis points. Excluding those deposits, net interest margin would have been about 158 basis points compared to 157 basis points in the third quarter. This increase in net interest margin from the third quarter was primarily due to the improved yields on the fixed income securities purchased in the fourth quarter. ","We maintained tight controls on expenses. Our compensation and benefits expenses decreased 10% or $93 million from the third quarter of 2011 to approximately $872 million, due primarily to lower salaries and employee benefits, achieved partially from the acceleration of the business operations and IT Transformation Program, as well as reductions in incentive compensation. Compensation and benefits expenses included about $13.5 million in nonrecurring costs related to the implementation of this program, with another $13.8 million reported in several other expense lines on the income statement. ","In the fourth quarter of 2011, compensation and benefits expenses were approximately 38.1% of total revenue, down from 40.0% in the third quarter, which was down from 40.8% in the second quarter, which was down again from 41.8% in the first quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our full year ratio is 40.2%. ","Other expenses were $274 million, up about 6% compared to the third quarter, primarily due to increased fees for professional services including nonrecurring costs incurred in executing the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. ","As Jay said, our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program is proceeding as planned. As we said when we announced the program in November of 2010, we expect the run rate of nonrecurring expenses to peak in 2012, averaging about $25 million per quarter, up from an average of about $20 million per quarter in 2011. The amount of net pretax run rate incremental savings for 2012 is expected to be $94 million, slightly higher than the update we provided on our third quarter call due to the acceleration of this program. ","Our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2011, increased about $2.7 billion compared to September 30, 2011, to $109.8 billion. During the fourth quarter, we invested about $12.9 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of 102.31 with an average yield of 2.34% and a duration of approximately 2.56 years. This is less than we have invested in the prior 3 quarters of 2011 because, as we have discussed with you, we invested early in 2011 to capture what we perceived to be good investment opportunities. ","The $12.9 billion of purchases was composed of the following securities: $1.1 billion in U.S. Treasury securities; $6.3 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities; $3.8 billion of asset-backed securities, including about $2.1 billion of foreign RMBS, mostly in the U.K; with the remaining $1.7 billion being invested in U.S. securities backed by credit card receivables, student loans and floating rate auto receivables. The remainder was invested in smaller amounts in various miscellaneous asset classes. The aggregate net unrealized after-tax loss in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of December 31, 2011, was $374 million compared to a net unrealized after-tax loss of $259 million as of September 30, 2011, and an improvement of about $130 million from December 31, 2010, when we -- the net unrealized after-tax loss was $504 million. ","The deterioration in net unrealized after-tax position compared to September 30, 2011, was due primarily to a modest widening in spreads. In our investment portfolio presentation, we have updated the data through quarter end for you to review. And as of December 31, 2011, our portfolio was 89% AAA or AA rating. ","The duration of the investment portfolio was 1.49 years, up from 1.09 years at September 30, 2011, due primarily to purchase of agency mortgage-backed fixed-rate securities. The duration gap of the entire balance sheet was 0.36 years, up from 0.09 years at September 30, 2011. This duration is in line with our historical duration gap, which we target to be a maximum of 0.5 year. ","Regarding European assets. We do not own any sovereign debt from the peripheral countries of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy or Ireland in our investment portfolio. Of our non-U.S. assets, we hold about $1.2 billion in securities from those peripheral countries, primarily RMBS and all floating-rate securities. About $500 million from Italy, $400 million from Spain and about $100 million each from Ireland, Greece and Portugal. All are performing within expectations and remain current as to principal and interest. Substantially, all our prime mortgages and the mortgages backing these securities all have relatively low loan-to-value ratios.","On Page 7 of the investment portfolio presentation, we list all of our non-US investments and show the average rating as well as the asset types we hold. Our primary non-U.S. holdings are British, Australian, German, Canadian and Netherlands securities, totaling 93% of the non-U.S. investment portfolio. At SSgA, our Eurozone exposure in the investment funds is consistent with client mandates. We hold the non-U.S. fixed income portfolios at their benchmark weightings ratings, and our actively managed cash portfolios have minimal exposure to the peripheral countries. ","Regarding pre-tax conduit-related accretion, we expect to record a total of about $1.1 billion in interest revenue from January 1, 2012, through the remaining terms of the former securities, including about $140 million in 2012. These expectations are based on numerous assumptions, including holding the securities to maturity, anticipated prepayment speeds, credit quality and sales. As of December 31, 2011, 59% of our investment portfolio was invested in floating-rate securities and 41% in fixed-rate securities. ","Now for our outlook on net interest margin. First of all, let me emphasize that we continue to believe that we should invest through the cycle. We also intend to invest in highly rated AAA- or AA-rated securities, agency mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities. I'll now review some of the assumptions we used in determining our 2012 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. We believe that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates on hold through at least mid-2013 and possibly beyond. The ECB has cut rates to 100 basis points, and we expect them to hold that level through the end of 2012. ","If the ECB rate declines further, we estimate our NIR will decline by approximately $25 million on an annual basis for each 25 basis point reduction. We believe the Bank of England will hold its base rate at 50 basis points through 2012. We project a potential reduction of 25 basis points from that rate by the Bank of England with lower net interest revenue by about $5 million annually in 2012. ","With these rate assumptions in mind, should our client deposits return to a more normalized level, then we would expect our average net interest margin for the full year 2012 to be between 145 and 155 basis points. Should the current level of excess deposits remain on State Street's balance sheet for which we receive a low rate of interest, then our net interest margin could be at the lower end of this range. ","In the fourth quarter, State Street Corporation's capital ratios under Basel I remained very strong. As of December 31, 2011, our total capital ratio stood at 20.5%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratios stood at 7.8%. Our tier 1 capital ratios stood at 18.0%. Our TCE ratio was 7.1%, and our Tier 1 common ratio was 16.0%. ","Based on our understanding of the Basel III regulations and the information published by the Basel Committee and the Federal Reserve, we estimate our capital ratios under Basel III as of December 31, 2011, to be: total capital, 14.5%; our Tier 1 leverage ratio to be 6.0%; our Tier 1 capital ratio to be 12.8%; and our Tier 1 common ratio to be 11.7%. ","For 2012, we expect the S&P to average about 1328, an increase of 5% above 2011's daily average of 1268 and the EAFE to decline 7.2% to 1494 from 1609 based on our view of little growth and market disruption in this region in 2012. ","In conclusion, while the economy in the United States appears to be very slowly repairing, the global economic outlook has continued to be uncertain. The headwinds created from the low interest rate environment, new regulatory requirements, increased compliance costs and the outlook for weak capital markets have led us to focus intensely on growing revenue, executing our business operations of information technology transformation program and controlling expenses in general in 2012. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Jay to conclude our remarks.","Joseph L. Hooley","Thanks, Ed. Given the difficult environment during the second half of 2011 and the effect it had on investor confidence, we remain cautious about 2012. Should the improved U.S. markets we saw at the end of the year and so far this year be sustained, we'd expect investors to re-risk, improving the outlook for growth. ","Given our outlook, we intend to continue to exercise expense control and to successfully execute on our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. We expect our core business momentum to continue. ","Our new business wins in 2011 were strong, and our prospect pipeline again looks good going into 2012. As has been the case for the past decade, our cross-sell revenue has been robust, demonstrating the power of our franchise. Our capital position remains strong, positioning us well for the new Basel standards, while maintaining flexibility if the right acquisition presents itself and providing the resources to increase our returns to shareholders. I believe that in 2011, the resilience of our strategy allowed us to achieve strong results and enabled us to achieve a capital position among the highest in our industry. We intend to apply the same principles to our business in 2012, in what we expect to be a continuing difficult environment. ","Before opening up the call to your questions, I remind you that our annual investor and analyst meeting will be held on February 9. During that meeting, we'll provide additional comments on our outlook for 2012. ","Now Ed and I are happy to entertain your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You continue to see great balance sheet growth during the quarter. Just curious, as the macro-environment says fairly choppy, are you seeing anything kind of unique and interesting about some of these continual frictional or nonfrictional inflows?","Edward J. Resch","Well, we saw a continuation of the third quarter into the fourth quarter with, actually, some increase, Howard. As I noted, we went from an excess deposit position of $15 billion in Q3 to $23 billion on average in Q4. We actually, as the year has started, are seeing a bit of a return to back to a more normal level on those deposits, but it's only been a short period of time. So hard to extrapolate a trend from that. But that's where we are short time into the year so far.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then thanks for all the detail on the NIM outlook. I guess there's debate that the ECB will cut further ahead of quantitative easing measures. I'm just curious, from your point of view, is there anything you can and would do to shift around some of the asset liability management, given either that view and what we're seeing in the U.S. in terms of the rise on the short end of the curve?","Edward J. Resch","No, not really. I mean, we feel pretty comfortable where we are, around that 60, 40 floating fixed level, Howard. Again, our investment plan is predicated on the rate forecast I gave you for the year. So I don't think we're anticipating much of a change from that.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then my final one's on just on capital return and payout. Ed, you walked through all the strength of the ratios at the end of the year. Maybe, Jay, I'm just hoping to get your appetite and potential ability to potentially increase that payout ratio in 2012.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, sure, Howard. Let me comment on that. As you know, we've recently submitted our CCAR plan. And as we expressed, our capital ratios is strong and getting stronger, and we think on a relative basis, some of the strongest in the industry. Based on that, it would be our hope to increase both our dividend payout as well as the level of share buybacks that we're -- that we had in 2011. So our hope would be to increase on both fronts.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And is there a sense of where you would like to take that, Jay, in the upper bounds?","Joseph L. Hooley","I won't say right now, Howard. Just that given the capital that we have, we think that increasing both of those is appropriate, and we'll see what the regulator's reaction is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two questions for you. First, a follow-on on Howard there. As part of the CCAR and then your outlook for other uses of capital management, you've commented on this last quarter, but just given that you've now submitted, maybe you have a better understanding. You have an expectation of hoping to get some decent amounts of dividends and buybacks in the CCAR plan. Can you talk to us about how M&A would be either included within that plan? Would it be a crowd out to buyback activity or could it be incremental? And as a part of that then, second part of the question is just then how is the European landscape continuing to evolve and opportunities that you see out there?","Joseph L. Hooley","Sure, Ken, let me -- short answer is we would view it as incremental. So as you know, the CCAR process really attempts to assess existing capital position, and we make judgments about any distributions for 2012. Doesn't really deal with existing capital levels or ability to take on acquisitions. So our view is that we should be able to increase the dividend and the buyback while leaving sufficient capacity to take on any acquisition within reason. I've given you in the past, within the investor services or custody space, we would view most acquisitions to be in the kind of $0.5 billion to $2 billion range. So based on our assessment, we think we could do all those things. And Ken, I think the other part of your question was really just the environment...","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The other part of the question is just regard to appetite and what -- obviously, the European dislocation disruption continues, banks are now formally shedding assets. What -- how do you look at the landscape? Do you think this is going to be an active year? Are there going to be opportunities on the table for you guys?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I do think it will be an active year, I think, for all the reasons that you've mentioned. We've got European banks recapitalizing, continued pressure on capital ratios. So -- and we've seen, I guess, some evidence in 2010, not necessarily in the trust and custody space of European banks -- 2011, shedding assets. I think that will continue, and we remain poised. So I think the environment is a positive one, and we think we're better positioned than anybody.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my second question is for Ed. Ed, you mentioned this in your prepared remarks about why some of the revenues in core business servicing and management were down because of customer derisking. But I just want to try to understand the juxtaposition between new business versus where the market's active versus transaction activity. So just how much of the decline in revenues was really related -- I guess -- trying to get the best way to ask it. Just the net of all those things was obviously negative, but how much of it was just the transactional activity versus the markets and then the positive and new business?","Edward J. Resch","I'd say, if you're looking for an attribution in terms of the -- for the quarter, right? Sequentially, the stronger dollar and market attribute about 1\/3 of the delta. And I'd say the other factors, which you're calling customer activity, client activity, is the other 2\/3.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And would you say that's the same in both servicing and -- that's more for servicing. Is it the same in -- and in asset management, it was more just flows?","Edward J. Resch","Much more skewed toward the client activity, 10 versus 90, something like that.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And so is that the type of thing that can reverse pretty quickly or if this environment stays where it is, that kind of level of activity could stay as low as it was?","Edward J. Resch","I think it is environmental dependent. If the environment does reverse, we could see a return back to more normal customer flows and levels. But if this environment continues the way it unfolded in Q4, we could see these types of levels being maintained.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry to go back to the previous question. But it feels like you guys are winning new business and sort of higher fee revenues, and I get that activity levels were a little bit lower. But do you think if we just kind of think about the custody business and the fee rate that you're earning today, on a go-forward basis, is that a decent run rate? And then a similar question for the asset management. It feels like the big runoff you guys had in the treasury win was extremely low fee, so it feels like the fact that you had some outflows there should actually benefit the fee rate, not drive it lower. So what's -- do you think the fourth quarter, I guess, is a good run rate on a fee rate basis for both of those businesses?","Edward J. Resch","Tough to prognosticate into the future. I mean, our market assumptions for next year are, on average, as I said, the S&P up about 5%. So I would think that there could be some uplift if that actually materializes, Alex. I mean, we are a little more cautious on EFA, as I noted in terms of our market assumption. I think rates are pretty well and certainly, in the U.S., a given. I think most people accept the fact that the Fed's going to stay at 25 for a protracted period of time. So assuming those environmental factors play out, I would not feel comfortable saying that the fourth quarter is a run rate to extrapolate into the future. I mean, certainly, we plan on having the business grow, and that's always the way we approach a year going in from a budget standpoint. So it is, though, partly, dependent on the markets, the environment and how customers feel about risking or rerisking or continuing to be in a relatively derisked position.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, and the next question, so speaking of budgeting expenses, it feels like this is probably a decent run rate on a quarterly basis. So Ed, when you're thinking about next year off of this kind of like a $1.6 billion per quarter run rate, what do you think is a normal growth and kind of like your core expenses? And then should we just think about the incremental $90-plus million savings that you've highlighted kind of -- just on top of that from an overall dollar perspective for next year?","Edward J. Resch","Well, again, I don't want to predict quarterly levels but -- in terms of expenses, but I think that the way to think about it is broadly, as you said, that we have an incremental contribution coming from the ops and IT transformation, which needs to be factored into the run rate. Obviously, the expense run rate is, in large part, calibrated based on the revenue performance of the company. And we're cognizant of that as we think about both our budget and our -- any adjustments we need to make either way, up or down. The other thing that I think you need to factor into your thinking is that we still see some headwinds from a regulatory cost and a compliance standpoint. That number is -- we estimate to be around $30 million annual next year. So that's going up from a $50 million number this year as we continue to work through the new regulatory landscape, figure out the effects of Dodd-Frank, et cetera. So -- and the other point that I mentioned in my comments, Alex, is that we expect the costs associated with implementing the ops and IT program this year to increase next year. So that would be an increment to the run rate. They will peak in 2012 at about $25 million a quarter. So there's a couple of moving pieces on the expense side, but I'd say, if you look at all of those things and then try to calibrate them to how the revenue environment is shaping up, that should give you an idea of what we're probably going to do on the expense side.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So put in another word, $90 million in savings, but the offset is drag of $30 million and maybe a little bit more in the implementation, maybe net savings of, I don't know, call it, $50 million to $60 million and then the core will grow on revenue.","Edward J. Resch","Yes, I mean, I think that's generally okay. But again, you have to look at the fourth quarter. We moved the incentive compensation down reflective of results. I mean, if the opposite is true, we may move some of that up. If you look at the first quarter, we have a bump in comp in the first quarter based on the accounting associated with our bonuses for the early-retirement eligible people. So it's a little tough to just take a quarterly average and kind of run it out through 2012. There's some peaks and valleys potentially.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then my last one, just on your comments regarding foreign change. I think this is the first time we heard of Charlesbank [ph] kind of talk specifically about some clients deciding to shift into other areas. So you alluded some of the decline this quarter, 26%, was partially driven by the shift in, call it, client mix. How much more of a drag do think this could be for you guys going forward, given how much money you're currently generating from the indirect business?","Joseph L. Hooley","I would say it's hard to predict. I would say, though, that for 2 years now, this has been a subject of discussion and debate, and customers have talked to us about the various ways of executing foreign exchange. And what you saw this quarter, although it was not a major driver, was more of a decline in volumes of volatility. But we saw some evidence of clients moving to different options. And as I've said repeatedly, we have all the options that are necessary, so no customers are leaving. And I'd expect over time, you'll continue to see some movement in that direction. What we're planning to counteract that is we're looking to drive more volume in the foreign exchange business, not only with our existing customers but new customers as well. So where that all levels out, it's hard to say, but not surprising that were seeing some movement in the direction of alternative execution platforms.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just on the lines of the FX question before, what was the proportion of FX revenue from the indirect channel in the quarter?","Joseph L. Hooley","Ed's going to look that up.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess, while he's looking on that, just another housekeeping. On the run rate savings, the $180 million, the way we should be thinking about that is $180 million lower expenses in the fourth quarter of '12 versus the fourth quarter of 2010, is that correct?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, that would be right, Brian. So full effect run rate at end of year.","Edward J. Resch","Brian, the answer to your question is about 50-50.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","50-50. Okay. That's up from last quarter. Okay. And then on the excess deposits. Ed, in your comments on the net interest margin, did you include any more aggressive investment of the excess deposits? I guess if they stick around a little bit longer, is there a possibility you could invest that in longer duration or do your assumptions basically assume continued very short investment in those excess deposits?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, it assumes more the latter in terms of keeping any excess deposits we have at central banks. We are, though, assuming, more of a normal level of excess deposits, if I could say that, and probably about half the level of the fourth quarter. We averaged $23 billion in the fourth -- $23 billion in the fourth quarter. Our planning for 2012 is about half of that, so we're on $11 billion on average. So it's more driven by that.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And is there any chance you could invest at a longer duration, or would you definitely continue to keep it short?","Edward J. Resch","I think we're of the view to keep it short. I mean, it's pretty transitory for the most part. I mean, just to put that in perspective, our point estimate at 1231 for excess deposits was $50 billion, 5-0. All right? So we're pretty cautious about where that -- where we put that.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Where you invest that, okay. And then you gave us your assumptions on the short-term rates globally, but can you talk a little bit about where you see intermediate rates, say, a 2- to 3-year treasury and a 10-year treasury for 2012 in terms of your NIM assumptions?","Edward J. Resch","About it is now, where it is now [indiscernible] have changed.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Jay, can you talk about the timing of the new businesses installments and the -- what was installed in the fourth quarter and what you have left to install in 2012, given the business that you've won so far on the custody side?","Joseph L. Hooley","Well, Brian, I think the number for the fourth quarter was $590 billion on the asset servicing business, and I believe there's $300 billion to be implemented. I'd say the majority of that in the first, a little leakage into the second quarter, so it's kind of front part of the year loaded.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","$300 billion to -- in the first half. And then was $590 billion installed? No, no. $590 billion was won in the fourth quarter, right?","Joseph L. Hooley","$590 billion was won in the fourth quarter, and off that, so $290 billion was installed in the fourth quarter and $300 billion flows over into 2012.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Got it. Okay. And then on the processing fees, you mentioned a couple of different, obviously, onetime items. Should we be thinking of that run rate at around that $70 million level or lower, given the new business -- or I'm sorry, given the exit of the business, the fixed income business and...","Edward J. Resch","Yes, there's been some noise in that line both ways in the last couple of quarters, Brian, some gains that were nonrecurring, and we would expect that fair value adjustment that I referred to as being nonrecurring in that line. So I think the -- kind of the average is probably better around that $70 million level, something like that.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, just to Jay, you did hit about 10% EPS growth on an operating basis in 2011 if we use the $0.93 for the fourth quarter. What's your thought about -- I know you try to grow your EPS about 10% to 15% annually, and you try to hit that every year. Obviously, we're in a tough revenue environment. What's your thought about controlling expenses to try to make that 10% EPS growth again in 2012?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, we -- I mean, I guess I'd begin by saying that we consider this to be a little bit of an abnormal environment in 2012 where we think we did a good job in generating EPS in 2011. It was driving the expense line. It was driving revenue. It was returning capital to shareholders. Now that -- to me, that theme is going to carry forward in 2012 where we're driving revenue on all fronts, looking at new business, cross sell, examining fee schedules, fee increases, new products. So we're driving on all fronts there. And I think you've seen, particularly evidenced by the fourth quarter, that we're prepared to take expense action in order to make sure that we calibrate to the environment from the standpoint of generating earnings. So expect more of the same for 2012. And we'll give you a little bit more insight when we get together in February at the investor and analyst conference as far as some of the underlying assumptions, which drive top line, bottom line and EPS. But I'm not in a position to do that right now.","Edward J. Resch","Brian, just to circle back to your FX question in the interest of completeness. 50-50 is FX, excluding the electronic execution. If you include the electronic execution, indirect's about 1\/3 [indiscernible]. Okay?","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jay, can you share with us -- in the past, you've talked about going back to the installed base and renegotiating maybe some pricing for your products. How is that proceeding? And are you having better luck with smaller clients or larger clients on winning price increases?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, Howard -- sorry, Gerard. I would say it's a journey. I think we've been at it for a while. I think -- when I look at, call it, broadly pricing power, the way I think about that is, first and foremost, we need to continue to develop and create new products so that we can differentiate ourselves. Because without differentiation, it's hard to get fee increases or pricing power. So combined with that, the more complex the deal, the better opportunity there is for differentiation and therefore pricing leverage, which naturally takes you to the larger end of our client base. I think in the smaller end of the client base, we can increase price through pricing increases, and it's probably easier to do, but it's got less impact. So our focus is really on looking at -- I think we have very good customer base profitability metrics, and all of our account teams know what target margins are and they're using all their tools within their power, cross-selling, fee increases to make sure that we get paid for the value that we're creating. And I think there's been some evidence of the ability to increase fees. I'd say some of the more common areas would be in things like securities lending, where we can shift the split, or in some cases, straight pricing increases. So let's say it's -- as each quarter rolls on and as the environment continues to be constrained, we're working harder and harder and more aggressively on making sure that we're capturing the right level of economics for the services that we're providing. So ongoing.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. You talked about potential acquisition opportunities should some of these European banks in particular look to raise capital by selling off maybe custody businesses. Are you guys seeing any evidence that there are some banks that may just have to throw in the towel because they're too small to compete with yourselves and JPMorgan Chase or Bank of New York who are real giants in the industry? Is there any evidence of that? Or do you guys see any of that in your day-to-day business wins where you continue to win from the smaller guys?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I'd say a couple of points there. One, pretty clear to me that this group of organizations that you're referencing are not growing. They're not gaining any shares. So we compete. It's rare that they show up in a meaningful competition. So I think from the standpoint of if you're looking from inside one of those, let's say, universal banks looking out, you wouldn't be seeing growth. I think the reason that these assets have not come out before now is that there's some perception that the deposit base provide some stability to their funding, so I think that's one of the reasons that a bank might be looking at potential assets for sale, that this would be not in the first wave or first phase. I think we're getting past the first phase. I think the need to raise capital overwhelmed. The belief that the deposits provide a good source of funding for these banks. So I think it's just a slow process. But they're not growing from what I can tell. They're not being funded, so new product investment is likely to be low. So I just think it's a little bit of a waiting game here, but it will eventually happen.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then finally on the return of capital approach, clearly, the Federal Reserve for you and your peers will have a dominant say on what can be returned to shareholders. If next year, meaning spring of 2013, if companies like your own get your final Basel III Tier 1 common ratio target with the SIFI Buffer by the end of '12 and you exceed that during the stress test, do you -- would you guys be comfortable in giving back to shareholders more than 100% of earnings if you exceed the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio under stress test conditions? And do you think the Federal Reserve would allow you to do it if you do exceed it?","Joseph L. Hooley","I would say a couple of things. One, up 'til now, the stress tests have really been geared around the following years, capital generation and how that might be deployed for things like buybacks or dividends. I don't know out a year whether that -- I think that eventually changes where you look at total capital and look at use of capital, look at -- not use of capital, but look at capital under stress. And you'd expect, over time, you'd see more flexibility. Too early to tell. I guess from another standpoint, we'd look at that from a standpoint of kind of the point in time. What does the acquisition environment look like? How much capital should we hold on the side to make sure that we didn't get shut out of that. And then what our stock was trading at and whether or not it would be attractive to buy back shares at what price. So it's very hard to project out over a year what the environment might look like. It's also hard -- although I think, over time, the Fed will relax rules around capital. And that will probably be a factor of the environment. If the environment looks, feels more stable, if Europe appears more predictable, it's likely we'll see more flexibility with -- from the regulators.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Stilmar with SunTrust.","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just really quickly. You showed an impressive amount of expense control this quarter. I'm wondering in terms of the motivation. Do you look at -- because of the environment, do you look at specific verticals of businesses and then choose not to continue like you did in some of the FX? Or are these regulatory businesses that you have changed your perspective around the opportunity? Or thirdly, is it something where the environment has caused you to look at other things in your business processes, like overhead and essential expense base to the platform that may not be as directly tied to a specific business line and take kind of that next level of expense cut? I'm wondering if you could kind of prioritize that in terms of how you look at businesses versus expenses.","Joseph L. Hooley","Sure. Let me take a swing at that. I would say -- the first thing I would say is, almost a couple of years ago, I think we got out in front of this a little bit by anticipating the environment was going to be challenging, and so we put in place the IT and ops transformation plan, which is pretty broad-based and far reaching throughout the organization. We anticipate upon execution we'll -- it'll affect close to 10% of the expense base of the company. So it's pretty pervasive, it's structural. It's recurring. It's hard to do, but will provide many benefits. So I'd say that's kind of the centerpiece. I would say beyond that, every year, every quarter, we review business lines, look at expenses against revenues. And there's a certain amount of calibration you can make there largely around headcount, around some of the other fees that are associated with delivering those products and services. I'd say the third dimension of how we view expense control is -- there are more short-term things we can do -- tend to be around things like consultant expense in this quarter. Incentive compensation, there are adjustments you can make in a quarter. So I would say we look at it across, I think, 3 dimensions: one, broad organizational structural changes in the cost base, and those will continue; two, at a product or a business line level, making sure that the product or business line is returning the right level of economics to the corporation; and then within a period, within a quarter, there are certain adjustments we can make. And we're focused on all 3 of those levers.","S. Kelley MacDonald","Brandy, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just what are your new expense initiatives in light of your more cautious outlook?","Joseph L. Hooley","Well, I think the -- so I just mentioned, I just talked about the IT and ops, which is the 4-year plan. I think the -- we made a decision this quarter to shut down our fixed income rates initiative, which we just thought wasn't going to allow us to achieve a hurdle rate that we thought we could achieve, we felt we needed to achieve. So we're constantly looking at business line level, our products reaching the hurdle rate. Other than that, we're looking at personnel efficiencies across the organization. We're looking at other expenses, how we -- what we pay for consultants, what consultants we use. So it's a little bit of my response to the prior question, Mike. It's structural, it's business line and it's at a point in time within a quarter things that we can moderate in order to reflect the environment that's occurring in the quarter.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I guess in terms of your outlook, is there any chance you can show positive operating leverage in 2012? Just have revenues go faster than expenses even if it's a decline? Or is it just too tough of an environment?","Joseph L. Hooley","I would say it would be tough. I mean, I've said before that if we approach again more normalized environments, 10-plus percent revenue growth, you'd expect a couple of percent of operating leverage as you get to a mid-single range. Maybe it's a percent as you get into the kind of 0 to 5 growth rates. It's -- things have to happen the right way in order to get operating leverage.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And I wasn't clear. Is the FX decline shifting, is that a structural change or away from your firm or to other places within your firm?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, Mike. No, it's within the house. It's just we have, I think, 4 different products within FX, depending on how people interact with us. And they're just moving from one option to another. But it's all staying within State Street.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And in terms of EPS guidance for 2012. I know you'll talk about that, but you're giving such a negative outlook. Don't you just want to get it out now? I mean, some sense?","Joseph L. Hooley","I think I'm not trying to give necessarily a negative outlook, just a realistic outlook around the challenge of the second half of last year. And I don't think anybody's ready to predict that the most recent markets are going to sustain themselves. If they sustain themselves, then my outlook changes. I think we're just being cautious. The most recent market action looks good. We still worry about Europe. So we're just trying to be realistic about the environment that we're operating in. And also being, I think, straightforward in our disclosure that we intend to keep adjusting the expense base to make sure that if the environment continues to be constrained, that we can continue to generate earnings. ","So we will look forward to seeing, hopefully, most of you at our investor and analyst meeting in February. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Now I would like to introduce Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations of State Street.","Valerie C. Haertel","Thank you, Christy. And good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2012 earnings call. You may have noticed that we made some changes this quarter to the presentation of information in our earnings materials as a result of feedback we received from many of you. We hope that the new format of the earnings press release and the addition of the financial highlights slide presentation are helpful in enabling you to access the information you need quickly and to aide your understanding of our results.","Our third quarter 2012 earnings materials, including the slide presentation that Jay Hooley, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Resch, our Chief Financial Officer, will refer to in their remarks and reconciliations of non-GAAP or operating basis measures to GAAP, measures referenced in this webcast, our financial trends package as well as other materials can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Before Jay and Ed begin their discussion of third quarter results, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street's 2011 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC.

Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, October 16, 2012. The corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.","Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Jay Hooley.","Joseph L. Hooley","Thanks, Valerie, and good morning. Welcome. I'd like to add my welcome to the third quarter call as well. And as Valerie noted, our remarks will follow the financial highlights slide presentation that we issued with our earnings press release. And more specifically, my comments will relate to Pages 3 and 4 of the slide deck.","We're pleased to report solid third quarter 2012 financial results, which I believe reflect continued strong demand for our products and services across our global client base, continued progress on our Business Ops and IT Transformation Program, as well as other cost initiatives, and our commitment to return capital to our shareholders.","As you can see, the GAAP third quarter earnings per share were $1.36 and included a benefit related to claims associated with the 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and a few offsets that Ed will cover in his remarks. But from my perspective, resolution of the outstanding issues associated with the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy is a positive and we're pleased to have these matters substantially behind us. If I go to operating basis earnings, here, where you can see, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $473 million or $0.99 in earnings per common share.","And before I review our business results, I want to make a few comments on the financial, economic and business environment. Since the end of the second quarter, the environment is Europe feels a little bit better. The ECB's commitment to buy bonds and the active discussion about common bank regulation in the Eurozone has given markets a sense that the probability of a tail risk event is declining, which is, I think, a very big move. I think that the European issues are far from resolved, but I think the concern up until now had really been an event. At the same time, concerns about the U.S. fiscal cliff are rising as we head into the elections and the year end, all of which contribute to a lack of confidence both at the institutional and retail level.","Equity markets performed well in the third quarter with the daily S&P average up nearly 4% and the daily EAFE average up approximately 3% from the second quarter. And despite this recent strength in equity markets, our clients, global institutions, mutual funds and their shareholders, continue to have an aversion to taking risk in their asset allocations and continue to prefer fixed income and cash over equities, which is a trend we've seen over the past several quarters.","If I turn to our results, our momentum from new business wins continued in the third quarter. New asset servicing mandates were $211 billion in the quarter, split roughly 55% from the U.S., 45% from outside the U.S. Again, our alternative asset servicing mandates for the quarter totaled 32 and that excludes the Goldman Sachs Administration Services business. If you include the Goldman Sachs Administration business, we now service over $1 trillion in total alternative assets. And as you've heard me say before, we believe that the alternative asset category is going to grow proportionately better than traditional asset classes. So we're pleased with our positioning there.","So our State Street Global Advisors. Net new assets to be managed totaled $78 billion in the quarter, which included a significant pass of fixed income mandate from an Asia Pacific client. We also continued to have success in our ETF product line with approximately $13 billion of the $78 billion representing positive flows into ETFs during the quarter, mainly into our larger ETF funds such as SPDRs, gold and fixed income, but also have noticed the success we've experienced in the 54 newer, more complex ETF products we introduced over the past 18 months. And as I say, as I look ahead in both the asset servicing and asset management business lines, the pipelines remain strong and well diversified from an asset class, as well as from a geographical standpoint.","Our market-driven revenues remain under pressure due to client risk aversion and deleveraging, in addition to persistently low interest rates in most part of the world. Trading service, and most notably foreign exchange trading, continued to be weak with volatility at the lowest level over -- in the past 5 years. And low interest rates are affecting our net interest margin, which was 144 basis points on an operating basis in the third quarter.","Turning to expenses. We're managing our expenses aggressively, as you can see from our results, while continuing to invest in the business. Third quarter expenses on an operating basis declined 3.7% compared to the second quarter. We achieved positive operating leverage compared to the second quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2011. And we'll continue to manage our expense base in the face of a challenging revenue environment.","We continue to be pleased with the expense reductions generated by our Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program, which remains on track to deliver the expected savings of $575 million to $625 million in pretax run rate savings by 2015. And I continue to believe that this program will provide us with strategic advantages to our business over time.","Turning to capital. We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and our common share purchase program. In the third quarter, we announced a $0.24 dividend per common share and we purchased $480 million of our common stock. As of September 30, there were approximately $840 million remaining for purchase through March 31, 2013, under our $1.8 billion authorization. With respect to our capital ratios, you can see on the chart that we continue to have very strong ratios under both Basel I and under the proposed Basel III standards based on our current understanding of the rules.","Before I turn the call over to Ed, I just wanted to touch on our acquisition of Goldman Sachs Administration Services. We're excited to have closed the transaction because it extends our leadership in this fast-growing product segment. Importantly, it brings to us a very attractive client base that will have access to a broad array of State Street services. Since we announced the transaction, as you'd expect, we've had a chance to meet with most of the Goldman Sachs administrative services clients. And their reactions have been very positive, which continue to give me confidence in our ability to achieve our 90% revenue retention goal. As we indicated last quarter, we expect this business to be accretive on a GAAP basis, excluding merger and acquisition costs, in the first full year of operation.","Regarding acquisitions more generally, we plan to be very cautious in our approach to acquisitions as we remain focused on our priorities that include leveraging the power of the core franchise, managing our expenses carefully, maintaining our strong capital position and returning capital to shareholders.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Ed.","Edward J. Resch","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. My comments this morning will follow the third quarter financial highlights presentation beginning on Slide 5.","As Jay stated, the GAAP results include a net pretax benefit of $277 million, which is composed of a $362 million benefit related to claims associated with the 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, partially offset by a $60 million provision for the previously disclosed litigation arising out of the financial crisis and a special $25 billion contribution to fund the company's charitable grant-making activities.","Now turning to Slide 6. I'll discuss our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings release and focus my remarks on the most significant sequential quarter and year-over-year quarter changes. We performed well in a difficult global economic environment. Comparing the third quarter of 2012 with the second quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2011, our total revenue declined 3.2% and 2.7% and expenses declined 3.7% and 2.9% respectively, generating positive operating leverage relative to both periods. Our third quarter return on equity was 9.6%. We purchased $480 million of common equity during the third quarter resulting in 480 million average fully diluted shares outstanding during the quarter, a reduction of 8.5 million average shares in the sequential quarter comparison.","Turning to a more detailed discussion of our income statement, Slide 7 details our revenue. The most significant revenue drivers for the quarter are noted in the far-right column. The sequential quarter growth of servicing fee revenue was driven by higher equity markets and net new business. Sequential quarter growth in management fee revenue was driven primarily by higher global equity valuations. Money market fee waivers were down $2 million from $7 million in the second quarter.","The increases in our core businesses were not enough to offset the decline in trading services, the seasonal decline of securities lending and the decline in net interest revenue due to the low interest rate environment. Total trading services revenue compared to the second quarter declined 9%, driven primarily by an 11% decline in foreign exchange revenue. Compared to the third quarter of 2011, the approximate 44% decline in foreign exchange revenue was due primarily to lower volatilities offset partially by increased volumes. In the third quarter, while we saw an increase in total foreign exchange trading volumes compared to the second quarter, as we have previously noted, our foreign exchange revenue was affected by a decline in our indirect or custody FX volumes, given the increased focus on this service. We have several ways to execute foreign exchange transactions and are in a position to service clients through their preferred foreign exchange execution method.","Brokerage and other fees declined approximately 7% from the second quarter due primarily to weakness in transition management and declined 10% from the third quarter of 2011 due primarily to lower electronic foreign exchange trading volumes. The volumes in electronic foreign exchange trading weakened in the third quarter compared to the second, but this weakness compares favorably to industry data. The rate of decline in the average daily volumes across all our electronic foreign exchange platforms was about 2% compared to larger industry-wide declines of 17% as measured on the electronic broking system platform and 11% as measured on the Thomson Reuters system.","Securities finance revenue declined 36% sequentially due to a decrease in activity from the seasonally elevated second quarter levels. Securities on loan averaged $321 billion for the third quarter of 2012, a decrease of 5% from the second quarter due to lower seasonal demand and a decline of 13% from the third quarter of last year due to lower overall demand. Processing and other revenue declined 50% from the third quarter of 2011 due primarily to a gain in the third quarter of 2011 and an increase in amortization expense related to tax-advantaged investments in 2012.","Our investments in tax-advantaged investments like renewable energy resulted in a tax benefit, which was the primary reason for a decline in our operating basis effective tax rate from 27% in the third quarter of 2011 to 24.5% in the third quarter of 2012. On a fully taxable equivalent basis, these transactions are favorable to our overall results. We now expect our effective tax rate for 2012 to average approximately 25.5%. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined nearly 3% from the second quarter due to the lower yields on earning assets as a result of the persistent low interest rate environment.","As we have been discussing with you for several quarters, higher-yielding fixed-rate securities in our investment portfolio are maturing or paying down and are being reinvested at lower rates, while floating-rate assets are resetting at lower rates. It's important to note that our investment portfolio is comprised of approximately 55% of floating-rate securities that adjust periodically with changes in market rates.","During the quarter, excess deposits remain elevated, averaging approximately $16 billion, an increase from $15 billion in the second quarter. Our net interest margin was 144 basis points in the third quarter of 2012 compared to 154 basis points in the second quarter of 2012 and 144 basis points in the third quarter of 2011.","Regarding our net interest margin. We continue to expect to achieve an operating basis net interest margin near the midpoint of the 145 to 155 basis point range in 2012. However, should excess deposits remain elevated, we may achieve slightly below the midpoint of that range. With the announcement of QE3 and the continued low level of interest rates in 2013, we think we will probably be near the higher end of the 10 to 12 basis point range in terms of decline in our net interest margin, assuming interest rates, spreads and prepayment speeds remain at their current levels through 2013.","Turning to expenses on Slide 8. You can see that overall expenses declined 3.7% compared to the second quarter and 2.9% from the year-ago third quarter. The decline in compensation and employee benefits expenses compared to the second quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2011 was primarily due to lower compensation benefit costs associated with the execution of the Business Operations and IT Transformation Program. Compared to the third quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2012, information systems and communications expenses increased as a result of the planned transition of certain functions to service providers as part of the Business Operations and IT Transformation Program. In the third quarter, compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total operating basis revenue was 39.0%, a slight increase from 38.8% in the second quarter.","I would like to remind you that our first quarter ratio was unusually high at 44.3% due to the impact of the effective employee demographics on equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees. Revenue growth is an important factor in determining the comp-to-revenue ratio. In setting our goal of improving the compensation-to-revenue ratio by 100 basis points for 2012 compared to 40.2% for 2011, we assumed modest revenue growth in 2012. However, revenue has declined on a year-over-year 9-month basis by approximately 50 basis points. While core revenues have performed reasonably well, market-driven revenues have been soft. We've been working diligently on improving our expense base and taking action where we can and we are continuing to do that in the fourth quarter.","Despite the revenue decline, our second and third quarter ratios stayed within targeted levels. However, if the overall revenue environment remains weak, it will likely affect our ability to achieve our compensation-to-revenue goal for the full year 2012. Our Business Operations and IT Transformation Program continues on track to achieve annual pretax run rate operating basis expense savings in the range of $90 million to $100 million in 2012. The estimated cumulative pretax expense savings through the end of 2012 are expected to be approximately $180 million. In the third quarter, our nonrecurring expenses related to the Business Operations and IT Program were approximately $30 million and should peak in 2012 and trail off in 2013 and 2014.","Wrapping up my comments on this slide, I just want to note that other expenses declined by 13% from the second quarter due to lower securities processing costs, where those costs were above trend in the prior quarter, as well as a decline in professional fees.","Turning to our balance sheet strategy and investment portfolio on Slide 9. You can see that our strategy remains intact. As outlined on the top half of the slide, the key elements of our strategy that have worked well for us over time include: investing in primarily AAA and AA rated assets through the cycle; maintaining an investment portfolio duration of about 1.5 years; maintaining a balance sheet duration gap of between 1\/4 and 1\/2 a year; and targeting an investment portfolio allocation of fixed-rate securities between 40% and 45%.","Our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2012, was $115 billion, a slight increase compared to June 30, 2012. We have a solid credit profile of 88% of our portfolio securities rated AAA or AA, slightly lower than our guideline of 90% due primarily to downgrades over time of certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. The duration of the investment portfolio is 1.52 years at September 30, 2012, a decrease of 1.59 years at June 30, 2012. As of September 30, 2012, 55% of our investment portfolio was invested in floating-rate securities and 45% in fixed-rate securities. The aggregate net unrealized after-tax gain in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of September 30, 2012, was $577 million compared to a net unrealized after-tax loss of $54 million as of June 30, 2012. The improvement in the net unrealized after-tax position compared to June 30, 2012, was due primarily to narrower spreads.","During the third quarter, we invested about $7.3 billion in primarily AA-rated securities at an average price of $100.83 and with an average yield of 1.67% and a duration of approximately 3.89 years. Of the $7.3 billion, we invested about $0.2 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities, $3.3 billion in agencies and asset-backed securities and $1.2 billion in foreign asset-backed securities, primarily Dutch and U.K. RMBS and German order receivables, as well as $1.1 billion in Japanese government securities. The duration gap of the entire balance sheet was 0.28 years, down from 0.41 years at June 30, 2012, due to the shorter duration of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio and longer duration of our client deposits.","Regarding European assets, we have no direct sovereign debt exposure to the peripheral countries of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy or Ireland in our investment portfolio. Of our non-U.S. assets, we hold about $900 million in securities from 4 of those peripheral countries, primarily RMBS and all floating-rate securities: about $400 million from Italy, $300 million from Spain and about $100 million each from Ireland and Portugal. On the whole, these securities are performing well.","Turning to capital. Slide 10 has a summary of our strong capital position. Our capital ratios are displayed on this slide. Our Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is 17.8% and our estimated pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio post the NPRs is 11.3%, both ratios as of September 30, 2012. Also based on our September 30, 2012, balance sheet and including the effect of the reinvestment of assets that are maturing or paying down and the acquisition of Goldman Sachs Administration Services business, the estimated pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio as of January 1, 2015, the assumed implementation date of the SSFA, would be 11.9%. We expect to complete our CCAR submission for 2013 early next year, in which we expect to include a capital distribution program of dividend and share repurchases consistent with our strong capital position and earnings capacity. The 2013 capital distribution, of course, will be contingent upon the Federal Reserve not objecting to our request.","Before I turn the call over to Jay, I wanted to mention that during the quarter, taking advantage of favorable market conditions, we issued fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock and redeemed our floating-rate perpetual preferred stock. In the third quarter, we recorded preferred stock dividends of approximately $7 million on the floating-rate preferred stock and approximately $8 million on the newly issued fixed-rate preferred stock. This latter dividend on the new issuance extends from August 21 through December 15, 2012. As a result, we will not record a perpetual preferred stock dividend in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our very strong capital position allows us to make returning capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases a priority.","And now I'll turn the call back over to Jay.","Joseph L. Hooley","Thanks, Ed. Let me briefly close so we can get to your questions with really 3 points. The first is that I believe our third quarter results demonstrate our continued resilience amid the difficult environment, as well as the strength of our business model. Second, we continue to invest in our business, expanding the range of solutions we can deliver to our clients. But we're balancing these investments with a clear focus on managing costs across the enterprise, and I hope you'll agree the results of this focus are evident this quarter.","And finally, I continue to have confidence in the secular trends that underpin the future prospects for growth in this business. And I believe we're striking the right balance between continuing to invest for the future and aggressively managing costs during this challenging period. As always, we appreciate our ongoing dialogue with shareholders and look forward to continuing to update you on the progress of our company.","And with that, I would open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So I want to ask this the right way. There's been -- there's obviously changes on Wall Street on comp and the industry has adapted to the lower revenue backdrop. You guys definitely get a bunch of questions on that. And I wonder if you could speak to your views on how similar and how different obviously the business mixes are and what you can clearly control or not in the short run, so just really focus on the comp side of the equation.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes. Let me start that, Glenn. I would say we do have a different structure than what's traditionally referred to as Wall Street, in that we don't have a high variable incentive component of our overall compensation. It's a lot smaller than you'd find typically on Wall Street. So having said that, for us, the key drivers in managing down costs tend to be headcount-driven, efficiency in our core operating models, as well as -- and you've seen some evidence of that this quarter, managing the other cost category, the cost that we incur from outside suppliers. So those are really the big levers that we have. And I think the reason I continue to go back to the IT and ops transformation initiative that we have is that I believe that, that's fundamentally changing the cost drivers in this business. And it's going to take some time, but you'll find those changes will be durable and sustainable over time.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So you answered part of the follow-up, in that not a big percentage of the comp base is all that flexible on a short-term basis. I guess, someone put this question to me recently, so I want to put it to you. Does it make sense that the business mix would have a thereabouts 40% comp ratio when you look at say, asset managers or investment banks, that these days actually have same or lower, that attritionally are thought of as much more people-intensive, comp-intensive businesses? Is it the scaling of certain parts of the business that will put that ratio as high, if not higher than some of those other models?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes. I think that over time, we've hovered around 40% for a long period of time. And I think that maybe it's obvious, but I'll say it anyway, the fee-based components of the business, the service fee and management fee, I really look to the servicing fee-based business as the offset to that 40%, whereas historically, the market-based revenues, and you know what they are, they're the net interest revenue, securities, finance and foreign exchange, have provided the upside. So I would like to think that the moves that we're making today against a very constrained, market-driven revenue should put us in a position where that 40% should go down over time as we achieve something near-normalized environmental factors, which is consistent with the $600 million cost-save plan, which we're 1\/3 of the way into at the end of this year. We should see that ratio go down.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Got it. One last one, I apologize if I missed it earlier. But did you mention the one but not yet funded pipeline?","Joseph L. Hooley","We didn't, but we will. Ed, do you want to cover that?","Edward J. Resch","Yes. I'll give you those numbers, Glenn. Out of the $211 billion of asset servicing mandates that we announced this quarter, $86.1 billion was installed in the quarter prior to September 30. The remaining $125.2 billion is expected to be installed during the remainder of this year and later. And then in the third quarter, we also installed approximately $115.7 billion of new business and assets to be serviced that we were awarded in prior periods.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","First question I had, I just wanted maybe a little point of clarification about next year's NIM guidance. The 10 to 12 basis points, is that off of where you expect this year to average or where you expect the year to end?","Edward J. Resch","It's off of where we expect this year to average, Rob.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And maybe talk a little bit about the ETF business. I know you touched on the strong flows there. But clearly, you've had Vanguard in their announcements, some BlackRock make some strategic announcements in their iShares business yesterday. So could you maybe talk about how, if at all, you think you are positioned within that relative to some of that changes your peers have made or how it's making you maybe rethink your approach to the business and if there's any changes you need to make in the direction or strategy?","Joseph L. Hooley","Sure. Yes. Happy to do that. You've heard me say before and I think underpinning the BlackRock and the Vanguard statements have been an industry that's growing pretty rapidly and has a pretty attractive growth rate. From our standpoint, our strategy for ETFs, and you've seen, I think, the last 3 quarters some pretty strong net flows, including $13 billion this quarter, has been really to have some positioning in what I would say is the commoditized end of the ETF space, but most prominently SPDR, which is our S&P 500 fund, and then really differentiate through new product introduction. I referenced 54 new products. Those new products almost all have quite a bit higher management fees associated with them. So we think the strategy should be to compete in a commoditized area and in the newer area, which tend to have higher revenues, more innovation. That's where we're putting a lot of our focus from a standpoint of investment. Now the other thing I would say, which I know part of your question is anchored around fees and the movement of fees, our large SPDR fund has and has forever breakpoints in it. So it's kind of a natural -- if somebody gets to a certain size in that fund, they get a natural fee break associated with it, which I think is a little bit of an unusual structure. So we feel like we've structurally made those adjustments around volume and fees in the core products. And as I say, our orientation is primarily towards new product introduction and the other angle I would say is geographic growth. So the ETF business still is largely anchored in the U.S. I think Europe and Asia represent significant opportunities. You won't remember this probably, but we were the first to introduce an ETF in Asia. We're building on that strength. So we think it's a great product. It's got good growth trajectory, which should sustain itself. And we're trying to make sure that we're innovative on the product side so that we're not racing to the bottom on the fee side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","My first question, just regards to the NII outlook. Ed, on the 10 to 12 basis points for next year, can you just -- I know it's really hard to forecast, but can you try to give us some perspective of how you're expecting the balance sheet size to trend?","Edward J. Resch","Yes. I mean, we're expecting low- to mid-single digit growth in customer deposits, which is our estimate at this point in time, Ken. I mean, I would tell you that relative to QE3, which is, I guess, where you're going, we feel that by putting the guidance at the top of the range, 10 to 12 basis points, use 12 for this discussion in terms of the decline next year, that, that captures the pressure that we're going to see on NIM. We've talked about this before, and our initial thinking already had the impact of lower rates included in it. And since we have a limited amount of fixed-rate runoff next year, and that's about a $6 billion number, we feel like the estimated NIR impact from QE3, which would be incremental to the earlier guidance, is in the range of $15 million to $20 million, which is about 2 basis points.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right. So okay. And then -- so when you talk about low-single digit core deposit growth, are you also presuming at this point that the excess liquidity is sticky and that the balance sheet actually might see growth from where it currently is today?","Edward J. Resch","We expect some of that excess -- those excess deposits to transition away. So we're not projecting a significant balance sheet growth next year. No.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So the core might offset the runoff of the excess? And then there's the -- the rub is just where that ends up in.","Edward J. Resch","Yes, rough. I mean, just like the rub this year, Ken, on the NIM is where excess deposits end up, right? So that's the point of friction.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my second question, just related to NII. It just seems like you are extending duration, a decent amount, just hearing what you rattled off in terms of your incremental purchases. So how are you balancing out again this QE3 balance with incremental risk-taking? It sounds like you're buying your very high premium bonds and extending pretty decently. So what's the incremental risk you're taking on the interest rate side to get that extra yield?","Edward J. Resch","Well, we're actually not taking much incremental interest rate risk. I mean, our duration gap is shorter this quarter than it was prior quarter, 0.28 was the number at September 30 versus, I think, 0.41 the prior quarter. And we have an offset with mortgage duration coming in, with prepayments accelerating a bit because of QE3. So we feel like we're taking appropriate levels of interest rate risk. And when you see our Q, you'll see the rate -- the ramp and shock are basically in line with prior quarters relative to the effect on our interest rate risk position.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my last one is just servicing fees are still down year-over-year against a big improvement in the market levels and a lot of new business wins. And Jay, you touched on this in your written commentary in the release. How much is the negative impact from low volumes and activity? And what do we need to really see that servicing line start to do what it can do?","Joseph L. Hooley","Sure. You're right about the year-over-year, and I would say it's -- the most material factor underpinning that is this -- a derisking that I tried to come on to, which is as our customers shift their asset allocation more to less risky assets, fixed income and money market versus equity, global equity, emerging market equity, there is a meaningful change in revenue per unit of asset. And that's not even including the foreign exchange associated with that. So I think that it's a little bit frustrating, particularly against a backdrop of better equity market, although that equity market growth is based on some pretty thin volumes. And we're just not seeing any broad-based movement to rerisking. So I think the other question you asked, Ken, is what would it take to change that. I intentionally in my prepared remarks talked a little bit about Europe, which to me feels better. I think that if we could -- if Europe looks like just a long, grinding recovery versus high event risk, and I think we're moving to that second phase, where the likelihood of event risk declines. And then I think the focus has moved to the U.S., elections, fiscal cliff. You could paint a scenario that as Europe continues to reduce its tail risk and the U.S. gets through the end of the year and the first part of next year, if there was a scenario where the fiscal cliff got resolved, I think the confidence level, which underpins the thing that's pressuring our service fee revenue, I think you could make an argument that, that's a real positive. And that would cause people to move into riskier assets, which would have a pretty meaningful effect on our revenues. So same assets but allocated differently, and then you'd also bring on the foreign exchange volumes, the volatility, so, so. That tries to explain why the year-over-year is where it is and attempts to give you a scenario where maybe confidence improves, rerisking occurs. And that should result in some pretty meaningful upside to us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with ISI Group. And his line disconnected. Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jay, just as we see some time lines to U.S. derivatives reform, I was hoping you could update us on just where we are in some of these tactical opportunities that I know you're excited about and positioning the firm for in asset servicing side, things like collateral management and derivatives. How long is this going to take to play out in your mind?","Joseph L. Hooley","I think it's -- stubbornly, it's taking a little longer than anybody thought. The CFTC is pushing hard, but the rulemaking has been a bit slow although steady. We have -- and as you rightly point out, we've put a fair amount of investment into both derivative-clearing initiatives as well as collateral management. And we have customers onboard, so we're even ahead of the final rules from the CFTC regarding derivatives clearing. The buy side is moving to essentially clear some of these things even before they have to, which maybe isn't surprising. And so we're starting to see customers, we're starting to see small amounts of revenue. I think that as the rules get finalized with specific dates, we should start to see a steady stream of revenue associated with these initiatives. And we think it could be material over time. So we still believe in it and the regulations have been slow, but it hasn't deterred us from investing in the platforms and the expertise to position ourselves for it.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then Ed, just follow up on the reinvestment environment. Just looking at 2013, putting aside frictional deposit impact, just how much of the floating portfolio do you anticipate is scheduled to roll off? And just what are some of the examples of securities you're investing in, I mean, that kind of land us at that 10 to 12 basis point compression?","Edward J. Resch","Yes. About $9 billion or so of floating rate, we expected to reset next year for a total of about $15 billion for the year, Howard. And the way that we get to the QE3 effect, which again is incremental to what we said previously and puts us at about 12 basis point decline in NIM year-over-year, is the following, okay? Our fixed-rate runoff yield is about 3.2%. Our new purchases that we expect next year, about 1.2%, principally mortgage-backed securities. The difference is 2%, obviously. Already in the 10 to 12 basis point was about 150%, so the effect of QE3 is an incremental 50 basis points. And 50 basis points on the $6 billion of fixed-rate runoff is $30 million. We're going to average that over the year, so that's how I get the $15 billion. And I say $15 million to $20 million of NIR effect.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. And just, I mean, given the challenging environment, I mean, are you all thinking about anything different on the funding cost side?","Edward J. Resch","Not really. I think we're pretty low.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just final one from me. With respect to the foreign exchange business, I mean, Jay, you noted the low volatility. But I mean, you've been discussing kind of the channel mix shift within that business pretty actively for the past year. I mean, what inning are we in? How much left do you all see here?","Joseph L. Hooley","We see some movement away from -- well, let me back up. The movement from custody FX to its other forms, our pricing is in the service we have, daily electronic servicing tied to an index. That movement has ground away for years, it's accelerated a bit over the course of the last year or so. Middle innings, late middle innings, yes. So it's -- some of it is work-through. I think I would say an additional way to look at it, the way we're looking at it, is there's some inevitability to these trading businesses as they go electronic. And for us, the objective is to retain the volume, to move it to platforms that fit customer needs. And by the way, some customers believe that custody FX is the right fit for them. And in addition, if you look at the foreign exchange franchise that we have here, there's a fair amount of noncustody business. So we've demonstrated that we can grow that business independent of the custody franchise. And we view this as an opportunity to gain share. So we think we've gained share. We know we have the widest variety of options to trade foreign exchange, at least among the trust bank universe. And so what we're doing is trying to gain more volume through more options to offset the natural compression spread that occurs from a voice-traded security to a electronic-traded security. But probably middle innings.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just one more on the portfolio. That was good color on the reinvestment side of it. Just the 1.2% MBS reinvestment yield that you mentioned, Ed, for your sort of projections for next year. Is that also the current yield that you would be investing in right now? Or are we a little bit lower than that right now?","Edward J. Resch","We're a little bit lower. I mean, it went down, I think, about 85 basis points when the QE3 was first announced. And I think we're a little bit below the 120 level now.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you're assuming a little bit of steepening in that in your NIM guidance for next year?","Edward J. Resch","Yes.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. Okay. And then on the premium amortization, the coupons that you're buying at are pretty -- or the premium that you're buying at is fairly low. But was there a significant impact of premium amortization acceleration this quarter, given prepayment speeds going up?","Edward J. Resch","Well, we're not buying premium mortgages, Brian. No, I mean, we had some prepayments in the U.S. in the quarter that served to actually depress our net interest revenue a bit in the quarter.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just to switch back over to the comp-to-revenue outlook so can you just remind me then what that guidance implies for the fourth quarter comp-to-revenue ratio if the revenue environment, let's say, stays stable in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter?","Edward J. Resch","If the revenue environment stayed stable, I think we'd probably be in the position where we're considering some adjustments as we work through the quarter. So speaking on that basis with that assumption, I'd say we're probably in the 39% or a little bit below type range for the fourth quarter, Brian.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then Jay, as you mentioned earlier, going into 2013 to get the comp-to-revenue below 40% and obviously, as the IT and ops transformation program helps that. If we do stay in, let's say, a flattish revenue environment in 2013, do we still think you can get significantly below the 40%? Or would you be more right around 40%, inclusive of that first quarter additional noncash comp?","Joseph L. Hooley","I would say it's probably a little premature to comment on that. What I can say is, as you know, we've got, I think, it's $200 million of saves associated with IT and ops next year. So that should be a big factor. But we're still, as you'd expect, going through the overall planning for 2013 to determine where we'll peg revenue based on different scenarios and what expense actions we're going to take. So I'd prefer to hold on that one until we get to the fourth quarter and give you maybe a more informed response to that.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. Sure. No, that makes sense. And then just lastly, if you can comment, Jay, on the repricing environment. Obviously, we continue to be in a fairly subdued market-based revenue environment, as you talked about. What is your outlook, say, over the next 6 to 12 months and sort of your ability to generate higher revenue realization rates off of the assets that you're administering? And if you can include comments of -- or include in that -- within that a cross-sell of additional services -- your expectation of cross-sell of additional services into that cost inside [ph] base?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes. I would say pretty good progress, Brian. I think I mentioned in a prior quarter that we've got a fairly structured and organized approach to client profitability, where people fall below margins. We've gone out with a couple of waves, waves being groups, hundreds of customers, where we have proposed fee increases, and the take has been good. The clients largely have accepted fee increases, as you'd expect, where we're starting towards the lower end of our account base. But we've been pleased with the response, and so we're moving up the client base. I think your cross-sell comment is pertinent here because we're a little bit indifferent to how we improve the economics of an individual account relationship. And in fact, we probably prefer to sell them more services, which would collect the net income deficit that we have on our side and grow our revenue stream. And I think we're particularly well positioned when you think about the range and breadth of product that we have to do that. So you'll see -- I think you asked over the next 6 to 12 months. Progressively, we'll work up the account base and make sure that we get to all the relationships that we have. And as I say, I think we have the best toolkit available in order to remedy situations where client profitability has dropped below our target margin. So good progress.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ed, I wanted to kind of touch upon something you talked about a couple of quarters ago, which is once everything is said and done, the pretax margin benefits should be about 400 basis points from the time you announced the program. So given the fact that it feels like the revenue environment is a little worse, especially in some of the higher-margin bucket, NII, FX declining, et cetera, do you guys still feel comfortable around that 400 basis point margin expansion? Or do you need to do more on the cost side to achieve that target?","Edward J. Resch","Well, we're going to continue to work on the cost side. As we've said many times on the call, Alex, the ops and IT transformation program is progressing on track. But I think that you have to go back and look at the basis upon which we said the 400 basis points would be achieved. And that was pegged off of the 2010 results, with all else being equal. And obviously, the world has changed since then. But let me try to break down for you where we think we are relative to the operating margin on a pretax basis, given the success that we've had on the transformation program. And I'll do it comparing September year-to-date this year versus September year-to-date last year. And I think that's the best way to do it. And given what we've done on the transformation program, that should drive 120 basis points of margin improvement, okay? We consider that to be part of the core of the company, of the business. You have to adjust, secondly, for the one-time items that occurred in both '11 and '12. And that actually depresses margin by about 50 basis points, and those are principally securities gains and some nonrecurring items that we've called out over time. So you've got a depression of 50 basis points on the margin. You have 120 basis points of improvement in ops and IT. And that leaves you with the core, okay, including the ops and IT achievement, of up about 40 basis points for your -- I'm sorry, down about 40 basis points for about your 90 basis point decline in margin, okay? So we break it down really those 3 buckets, the ops and IT achievement, the effect of that on the core, and then the adjustment for the one-timers.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And my second question is, Jay, you mentioned we're heading back into CCAR times. So when you guys think about the preference for dividend over buyback -- I don't know if it's too early to talk about it, but clearly, it feels like there's preference for dividends for some of the financial institutions that could pay it out. What's your appetite for bumping up the dividend maybe closer to, I don't know, like a 30% payout versus what it is now or maybe even above that?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes. A good question, Alex. And as you pointed out, we're in CCAR season, almost into CCAR season. And you'll also recall, I think, it's the fourth cycle that with regard to dividends, the Fed has been -- has provided some guidance, let's say, around appropriate levels of dividends. And 30% is the number that we've all been kind of managed to. I think that as we go into the stress test, my comments about Europe, which I think have kind of broadly understood, hopefully it will cause the Fed to, as they have in the previous years, provide a little more latitude or a little bit more nuance to banks that are very well capitalized such as ourselves versus others. So we would expect more and more flexibility as time goes on. The dividend versus the -- first off, I should say that our expectation, and I think Ed referenced this, is that returning capital to shareholders is our #1 priority. So the rate that we're running at today, we would hope to at least be the same going into the next cycle. And depending on what other signals we get from the Fed, that could be adjusted. With regard to the mix of dividend versus buyback, we look at that every year. If we have flexibility, we'll look at whether or not it makes sense. And by the way, we derive a lot of our input from talking to shareholders over time. We'll make that determination. But up until now, there hasn't been too much latitude. I think you're aware of this. The latitude changes, then we'll assess the mix, as well as the overall return level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Ketron with UBS.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","In terms of thinking about the revenue environment or the current environment and the impact that it's had on revenue, go back earlier this year, you'd made the comments predicated on moderate revenue growth, you would have a certain comp payout ratio. The fact that revenues have trended to more of a kind of a flat year-over-year growth basis, is the way to think about the revenue opportunity being flat versus moderate growth, more of that takeaway is due to just lower activity, lower volatility levels and, I guess, impact on margin? And then if we did see that return, that would get you back to more of the moderate revenue growth that you were maybe expecting earlier this year?","Joseph L. Hooley","Absolutely. And I would, further to that, Greg, say that this derisking thing, which is a newer phenomenon in the past several quarters, same applies. So I take it back to confidence the world gets better, investors more likely to take more risk. As investors take more risk, they move out into equity, global equity, emerging equity that drives higher revenues, that drives higher activity volumes as in trading volumes, higher FX. So the other way of responding to your question is we're working very hard to make sure that the core revenue lines have the appropriate level of expense offset against them. We're working in this constrained environment, where low confidence levels, low interest rates are casting a pall on many of our variable revenues. I think as we move through this and get our -- right-size our expenses against those core revenues, there should be a lot of leverage on the upside once things break and confidence restores. And that's what we're playing for.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. Thanks for the color on that, Jay. And then Ed, maybe on the excess liquidity or if you look at the deposit levels, do you have a sense for how much in excess deposits you have today and what kind of impact that is having on the margin?","Edward J. Resch","They're staying about where they were in the third quarter, Greg. No significant increase or decrease at this point, so in that $15 billion, $16 billion average range.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And how much that may be weighing on margin?","Edward J. Resch","Well, I mean, we said at the beginning of the year, that we expected excess deposits to average about $11 billion for the year. Unless something significant happens in the fourth quarter, that probably won't materialize. And predicated on that assumption, we put the range of our NIM out for the year, Greg, 145 to 155. So if excess deposits are higher, which we probably expect above the $11 billion average, that's the basis for us saying we'll probably be around the middle of the range for the year in terms of NIM. If the opposite were true, we'd obviously be in a higher position relative to NIM.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then the charges that are out there potentially for deposits in certain parts of Europe, do you expect that they have any meaningful or noticeable impact?","Edward J. Resch","You're talking about our announcement that we're going to charge negative rates, relative to Swiss and krona?","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes.","Edward J. Resch","No, we don't expect that to have a significant effect. They're fairly immaterial currencies to us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hopson with Stifel, Nicolaus.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just on the asset management trends. I know there were a couple of larger items. But anything beyond the ETF business that we've already talked about, anything else that would be driving the pipeline? And then on the asset management flows, were those through the full quarter? I know the ETFs were particularly strong in September. But was the other mandate in for the full quarter?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes. Let me take that one, Jeff. As far as overall trends, a little bit of reflection of my broader comments, which is we're seeing flows into passive asset categories, cash. I think cash was up $5 billion in the quarter. So it tends to be the more conservative asset classes. Having said that, our new products, the 54 new products that we introduced, good flows into those, too. So mixed, but anchored around lower-risk assets. With regard to the large Asian-based passive fixed income mandate, that was installed in mid-September, so kind of later end of the quarter.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then finally on the expenses in Q4 in regard to the comp number, anything that we should think about in terms of accrual adjustments, et cetera, that would affect the number otherwise?","Edward J. Resch","Well, I mean, we'll determine where we're going to set the incentive comp levels up the chain with the normal year-end process. And out of that could come some accrual adjustments, certainly. It depends on how the year ultimately sorts out from a performance standpoint.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I hand the program back over to Mr. Jay Hooley for closing remarks.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes. Thanks, Christy. And thanks, everybody, for your attention and good questions.

Kelley MacDonald","Before Jay Hooley, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Resch, our Chief Financial Officer, begin their remarks, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street's 2011 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC.","We encourage you to review those filings, including the sections on risk factors concerning any forward-looking statements we make today.

Hooley","Thanks, Kelley, and good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning. Overall our financial results improved in our second quarter from our first quarter of 2012, with a 20% increase in operating basis earnings per share, but were affected by increasing weakness in international markets, reflecting global concern about the stability of the Eurozone.","We remain cautious in our outlook for the second half of the year and very focused on delivering value-added solutions to our clients and controlling expenses.","Our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program has contributed to our results in a difficult market environment, while positioning us favorably when the economic outlook improves, and has also enabled us to accelerate new product development for our clients.","In addition, the reduction in compensation expenses and strong expense control, coupled with business momentum, enabled us to achieve positive operating leverage in the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2012 on an operating basis.","The ratio of compensation expenses to total operating basis revenue improved to 38.8% in the second quarter, as a result of the absence of the seasonal accounting effects related to retirement-eligible employees recorded in the first quarter and a continuing success of the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. Our capital position remained very strong and allowed us to repurchase 480 million of our common stock in the second quarter of 2012 and to increase our quarterly common stock dividend in 2012 to $0.24 per share.","In addition to remarks about our second quarter results, this morning I'll address our continuing success in generating new business in our core asset servicing and asset management business, our economic outlook, the ongoing progress of our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program, as well as our strong capital position.","The growth of both our fee-based businesses and our total revenue in the second quarter compared to the first quarter was affected by the derisking activity of our clients in the second half of the second quarter. Our results reflect stronger U.S. equity valuations early in the quarter, as well as the seasonal strength in securities finance, but equity markets became more volatile later in the quarter and remain so today. Capital markets affecting foreign exchange and trading were weak throughout the quarter.","Compared to the first quarter, the impact of the new business we won and installed, plus the business we won in past quarters, provided some strength in our core business revenue in the second quarter.","We continue to add new servicing business to the core franchise. Of the $133 billion in assets we won in the second quarter, about 48% were from the U.S. and 52% from international markets. The Board of Trustees of the $36 billion Maryland State Retirement and Pension System renewed its global custody contract. We won a significant mandate for servicing collective funds from a Middle Eastern client to service their conventional and Sharia-compliant fund umbrellas.","Mitsui Fudosan, a Japanese real estate firm, has extended its relationship with State Street to include administration, registrar and trustee services for 2 additional Jersey property unit trusts. The endowment fund at Emory University has expanded its custody and accounting services, now including risk analytics services for its $5 billion endowment.","The integration of the acquired Intesa Securities Services business has met our stated targets, and our presence in Italy continues to attract new business. Just recently, SSgA was appointed as investment manager for EUR 110 million in assets for the Italian pension fund of employees of Rai, the Italian public television network. SSgA has also been selected by family investments to manage a combination of passive equity and fixed income strategies for GBP 1.5 billion in asset, as well as the tactical asset allocation overlay for the majority of these assets.","Regarding the timing of asset servicing installations, during the second quarter we installed $130 billion, $79 billion of which was awarded in the second quarter and $51 billion was awarded previously. Of the total business award in the second quarter, about $55 billion remains to be installed.","In the alternative asset servicing area, demand remains strong. In the second quarter, we added 32 new mandates in our alternative investment servicing business, and our assets under administration were $877 billion as of June 30, 2012.","We announced the proposed acquisition of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund administration business early today. This business had a total of $200.6 billion in assets under administration as of March 31, 2012.","This acquisition would increase our alternative assets under administration to a level which solidifies our lead in servicing this fast growing asset category. We expect this acquisition to be accretive in earnings in the first year of operation on a cash basis, excluding one-time costs.","Let me now share our outlook for the global economy. The lack of stability in Europe seems to be dominating every macroeconomic headline for the past 2 months. The election in Greece was positive, but the outcome has not been persuasive enough to alleviate concerns that Greece may exit the euro. Questions were also raised in the market about the stability of Italy and Spain. The decision by European leaders in late June to create a single supervisory body to oversee the recapitalization of euro area banks alleviated some of the concern, but until the European stability mechanism is in place and functioning, the uncertainty in Europe will overhang the economy.","Looking forward, we expect global GDP to rise at somewhat anemic 3.2% in 2012, reflecting slow growth in the advanced economies and more marked slowing in the developed ones. We expect the U.S. recovery to remain lackluster, with 2012 GDP slightly -- growing slightly above 2%, up from 1.7% in 2011, but slow by historic standards.","While we currently believe that the GDP may increase in 2013, our view of 2013 is dependent on a likelihood of legislation to extend the Bush tax cuts and reductions in the federal budget.","Although consumer confidence in the U.S. has improved slightly and there are signs that housing prices are stabilizing, unemployment continues to be a problem with a worsening in the expected rate of unemployment for 2012.","In the U.K., the GDP declined in the first 2 quarters of 2012, the number of unemployed increased, and so technically, the country has slipped back into recession. The Eurozone economy rebounded in the first quarter, but then stagnated in the second. Based on our current outlook, we expect the GDP in the Eurozone to contract about 0.5% in 2012, followed by a slight improvement in 2013.","On balance, our outlook is cautious, primarily due to European uncertainty and the effects that it may have on the U.S. economy.","The performance of our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program continues to meet our expectations. In 2012, we expect that we'll achieve approximately $94 million in annual pre-tax run rate operating basis expense savings, resulting in a total of $180 million of pre-tax run rate operating basis expense savings since the beginning of the program.","In 2012, we expect the greatest benefit to come from the business operations transformation, as we deploy automation and reconfigure our operations to more efficiently meet the needs of our global client base. We are also focusing on transferring certain aspects of our IT management to our service providers, as we prepare for the migration of many of our existing and new applications to the cloud environment in 2013 and 2014.","We are training our IT developers on cloud technology and are currently running application using this technology in our production environment.","Our capital ratios remained strong, after paying a $0.24 per common share quarterly dividend and purchasing $480 million of our common stock in the second quarter. In addition, we announced the proposed acquisition of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund administration business at a purchase price of $550 million, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter, subject to regulatory approval.","I'll now turn the call over to Ed, then I'll provide some final remarks before we open the call to your questions. Ed?","Edward J. Resch","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll review 3 areas. First, the results for the second quarter. Second, I'll summarize the performance of an outlook for the investment portfolio, as well as worldwide interest rates and the impact on our net interest margin. And finally, I'll review our strong capital ratios. I'll present some of the more significant results comparing the second quarter of 2012 to the second quarter of 2011, as well as to the first quarter of 2012.","This morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings news release.","Our total revenue was down 2% compared to the second quarter of 2011, and increased 1% compared to the first quarter of 2012. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to the effects of weaker international markets. The quarter-over-quarter increase was due to seasonality in securities finance and strength in net interest revenue, offset partially by weakness in international markets.","Fee-based revenue in the second quarter was down 6% compared to the second quarter of 2011 and was approximately flat with the first quarter.","Compared to the second quarter of 2011, servicing fee revenue declined 3%, primarily due to the impact of weakness in international markets and the effect of the weaker euro, offset partially by net new business and a 2% increase in the daily average of the S&P 500. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, servicing fees increased 1% due to net new business, offset partially by weaker international daily equity valuations.","In our servicing business, clients derisked their investment preferences later in the second quarter, primarily moving from U.S. domestic and emerging market equity funds to fixed income and government funds. Management fees were down 2% from the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to weakness in month-end international equity valuations, offset partially by new business, and increased 4% from the first quarter due to new business, offset partially by weaker international month-end equity valuations.","Given the continued weakness in international markets, we are adjusting our assumption for the 2012 EAFE average to decline to about 1,400 for the full year, down 12% from 1,590 in 2011 and revised from our assumption of 1,490 earlier this year.","At SSgA, net new business was a negative $6 billion. This was composed of inflows into ETFs, adding about $7 billion in net inflows, with about $1 billion net into institutional and fixed-income funds, which were primarily passive, offset partially by $12 billion in cash outflows, primarily due to the reduced positions in securities lending collateral as the seasonal impact of the dividend season in Europe dissipated, and $2 billion of outflows from active and enhanced equity funds as clients derisked.","Our money market fee waivers were $7 million, a decline from $9 million from the first quarter of 2012. Regarding trading services and securities finance, trading services in the second quarter of 2012 declined 18% compared to the second quarter of 2011 and declined 9% compared to the first quarter of 2012.","Compared to the year ago quarter and the first quarter of 2012, second quarter foreign exchange revenue decreased 24% and 13%, respectively, with both declines due primarily to lower volatility reflecting weak capital markets, offset partially by slightly higher volumes. Compared to the second quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, brokerage and other fee revenue declined 11% and 4%, respectively, due primarily to weaker revenue from sales and trading.","In foreign exchange, the second quarter of 2012, the percentage of total foreign exchange revenue generated by our indirect offering decreased about 12% from the first quarter compared to a 15% decline in revenue from the direct foreign exchange services, both of which reflected overall weakness in the capital markets.","Compared to the second quarter of 2011, securities finance revenue increased 4% in the second quarter of 2012 due to higher spreads, offset partially by lower volumes, and increased 47% compared to the first quarter of 2012, due primarily to the normal second quarter seasonal increase.","In the second quarter of 2012, the average 3-month LIBOR to Fed funds effective rate was 30.2 basis points, compared to 16.1 basis points in the second quarter of 2011 and to 39.9 basis points in the first quarter of 2012.","Securities on loan averaged $337 billion for the second quarter of 2012, down from $379 billion for the second quarter of 2011 due to lower demand and up from $331 billion for the first quarter of 2012, due principally to seasonality.","Average lendable assets for the second quarter of 2012 were about $2.36 trillion, down 0.5% from $2.37 trillion in the second quarter of 2011 and flat with the first quarter of 2012.","As of June 30, 2012, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 18 days, flat with the second quarter of 2011 and up slightly from 16 days in the first quarter of 2012.","Processing fees and other revenue was $48 million, down 31% from $70 million in the second quarter of 2011, due primarily to a gain on a early termination of a lease in the second quarter of 2011 and additional amortization expense in the second quarter of 2012 related to our tax-advantaged investments.","Compared to the first quarter of 2012, processing fees and other revenue decreased 49% from $94 million, due primarily to the positive first quarter 2012 impact of fair-value adjustments related to positions in the fixed-income trading initiative and second quarter 2012 amortization expense related to our tax-advantaged investments.","Operating basis net interest revenue of $629 million in the second quarter of 2012 increased about 14% compared to the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to a higher level of earning assets, including a larger investment portfolio, as well as lower funding costs, partially offset by lower yields on our earning assets.","Compared to the first quarter of 2012, operating basis net interest revenue increased 4%, primarily due to lower funding costs and a larger investment portfolio, partially offset by lower yields on assets generally.","In the second quarter, excess client deposits averaged about $15 billion compared to $18 billion in the first quarter. Our operating basis net interest margin was 154 basis points in the second quarter of 2012, up slightly from 152 basis points in the first quarter of 2012.","Now turning to expenses. Compensation and benefit expenses decreased 7%, or $67 million, to $942 million from the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to the impact of cost savings resulting from lower incentive compensation, and 11% or $122 million from the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to the impact of the seasonal accounting effects of approximately $105 million of equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter. Additionally, both periods benefited from the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program savings, which were offset partially by the effect of merit increases effective April 1, 2012.","In the second quarter of 2012, compensation and benefits expenses were approximately 38.8% of total operating basis revenue, down from 44.3% in the first quarter.","For the full year, we continue to target a reduction of the ratio of compensation and benefits expenses to total operating basis revenue by about 100 basis points compared to 40.2% in 2011, assuming a modest increase in total operating basis revenue, an outlook which appears less certain now than in the first quarter.","The increases of 5% and 9% in information systems and communications expenses compared to the second quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, respectively, were due primarily to the transfer of certain IT functions to our service providers as part of the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program.","Operating basis other expenses were $291 million, up 20% compared to the second quarter of 2011 and up 19% compared to the first quarter of 2012. Both increases were due to higher securities processing costs and increased professional fees driven by regulatory initiatives. Our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program is on track. You can particularly see the progress we are making in the reductions in compensation and benefits expenses. In our operating basis expenses, we incurred $25 million of nonrecurring costs related to the program, consisting of $20 million in compensation and benefits expenses and $5 million in several other expense lines in the income statement.","As you may recall, we have previously indicated that we expect our nonrecurring costs to peak in 2012 at an average of about $25 million per quarter.","Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio as of June 30, 2012, of $114.4 billion increased about $8 billion compared to June 30, 2011.","During the second quarter, we invested about $7.9 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of $102.5 and with an average yield of 1.95% and a duration of approximately 2.54 years.","During the quarter, we invested about $3.3 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities and $2.7 billion in asset-backed securities. The remainder was primarily invested in small denominations of commercial mortgage-backed securities and in corporate and municipal bonds. The aggregate net unrealized after-tax loss in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of June 30, 2012, was $54 million compared to a net unrealized after-tax loss of $81 million as of March 31, 2012. The improvement in the net unrealized after-tax position compared to March 31, 2012, was due primarily to the benefit of lower rates, offset partially by the impact of wider spreads.","In our investment portfolio presentation, we have updated the data through quarter-end for you to review. As of June 30, 2012, our portfolio was 89% AAA or AA-rated. The duration of the investment portfolio was 1.59 years at June 30, 2012, up slightly from 1.57 years at March 31, 2012.","The duration gap of the entire balance sheet was 0.41 years, down from 0.49 years at March 31, 2012. And this duration gap is in line with our guidelines.","As of June 30, 2012, 57% of our investment portfolio was invested in floating-rate securities and 43% in fixed rate securities.","Regarding the European assets. We have no direct sovereign debt exposure to the peripheral countries of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy or Ireland in our investment portfolio.","Of our non-U.S. assets, we hold about $900 million in securities from 4 of those peripheral countries, primarily RMBS and all floating-rate securities. These entail $400 million of securities from Italy; $300 million from Spain; and about $100 million each from Ireland and Portugal. All of these securities are performing well, except for a few bonds. We sold all of our Greek securities during the second quarter, about $91 million worth, and recorded a non-operating pre-tax loss of about $46 million.","On Page 7 of the investment portfolio presentation, we list all of our non U.S. investments and show the average rating, as well as the types of assets we hold.","Our primary non-U.S. holdings are British, Australian, German, Canadian and Netherlands securities, totaling 91% of the non-U.S. investment portfolio. At SSgA, our Eurozone exposure in the investment funds is consistent with client mandates. We hold the non-U.S. fixed income portfolios in line with our benchmark weightings and our actively managed cash portfolios have no direct exposure to the peripheral countries.","Regarding pre-tax conduit-related accretion. We recorded $123 million in the first half of 2012. Looking forward, we expect to record a total of about $900 million in interest revenue from July 1, 2012, through the remaining terms of the former conduit securities.","These expectations are based on numerous assumptions, including holding the securities to maturity, anticipated prepayment speeds, credit quality and sales.","Now for our outlook for net interest margin. First of all, let me emphasize that we continue to believe that we should invest through the cycle. We also intend to invest almost exclusively in highly rated AAA or AA agency mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. I'll now review some of the assumptions we use in determining our 2012 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. We believe that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates on hold through the end of 2014. The ECB has recently cut rates to 75 basis points and adjusted its deposit facility rate to 0%. We expect these 2 actions to reduce our net interest revenue in the second half of 2012 by about $20 million.","We expect the ECB to hold these rates through the end of 2012. We believe the Bank of England will hold its base rate at 50 basis points through 2012. If the Bank of England were to lower its base rate by 25 basis points, it would lower our net interest revenue by about $5 million annually, assuming market rates fall in relation to administered rates.","Based on these rate assumptions and our second quarter results, if our excess deposits remain at the current level, our net interest margin for the full year 2012 will likely be in the middle of our 145 to 155 basis point range.","Finally, I'll briefly review our capital ratios. In the second quarter, State Street Corporation's capital ratios under Basel I remained very strong. As of June 30, 2012, they were -- our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios stood at 19.9%, our total capital ratio stood at 21.5%, and our Tier 1 common ratio was 17.9%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 7.7% and our tangible common equity ratio was 7.2%.","The impact under Basel I of the acquisition of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund administration business is expected to reduce our June 30, 2012, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio by 75 to 80 basis points.","I'll now direct your attention to the last page of the addendum including in this morning's news release. Column A shows our Basel I capital ratios. Column B shows our estimated Basel III ratios applying the rules effective as of January 1, 2013, to our balance sheet on June 30, 2012, and are calculated consistently with our disclosure of these ratios in prior quarters.","Our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was estimated to be 13.9%; our total capital ratio, 15.5%; our Tier 1 common ratio, 12.7%; and our Tier 1 leverage ratio, 6.1%. For ease in the following discussion, I will just refer to our Tier 1 common ratio, unless otherwise noted, although Basel III will have an impact on all the ratios.","The Federal Reserve recently published 830 pages of notices of proposed rulemaking, or NPRs, to implement Basel III in the United States. Like our peers, we are still reviewing the potential impact of these proposals, and the table on the last page of the addendum and my comments reflect our best estimates as of June 30, 2012, of the impact of these proposed rules. It is important to note that the rules recently proposed in the NPRs are not final, and once finalized, are expected to be phased in over several years. The regulators have specifically asked for comments regarding the inclusion of the mark-to-market on certain available-for-sale securities in other comprehensive income for the purposes of calculating regulatory capital. We intend to comment on this proposal.","Based on our understanding of the proposals, we believe that the simplified supervisory formula approach, or SSFA, that deals with the risk weighting of securitized assets is expected to be implemented on January 1, 2015. These proposed regulations have both positive and negative implications. As written today, higher quality assets are being disproportionately penalized in that they receive a higher risk weighting compared to the previous Basel III proposals, moving from 7% to 20% or higher depending on the securities.","In contrast, those securitized assets with lower ratings, such as those rated below BB- received more favorable treatment under the NPRs than under the previous Basel III proposals, adjusting the risk weightings from 1,250% to as low as 20%. During the comment period, we intend to present the regulatory authorities the disproportionate effect of these rules.","In Column C on the last page of the addendum, we display the estimated impact of these proposed changes to our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III, including our estimate of the proposed impact of the SSFA as we understand it today. These estimates are subject to change based on regulatory clarification and further analysis.","The implementation of the SSFA, without giving effect to asset run-off in the investment portfolio or any management actions, is expected to reduce our Tier 1 common ratio to 9.8%, approximately 290 basis points lower than the 12.7% ratio as calculated prior to the recently published NPRs and as shown in Column B.","Column D shows our estimate of our Tier 1 common ratio after getting effect to both the SSFA and the investment portfolio runoff and assumes reinvestment of $16 billion of relevant securitized assets.","As you can see, runoff alone is expected to bring the ratio back up to 12.0%. Finally, Column E shows that management actions, if needed, are expected to lower our risk-weighted assets to approximately $96.2 billion and fully restore our Tier 1 common ratio to 12.7%. Therefore, based on our current understanding of the proposed rules, the net effect of the risk weighting of the securitized assets under the SSFA, after investment portfolio runoff and with the potential management actions, is expected to be neutral to our Tier 1 common ratio by the assumed implementation date of January 1, 2015. We believe that 10% continues to be a reasonable long-term target for our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio using the same assumptions we outlined at our investor and analyst forum in February of this year. This 10% ratio is the foundation for our 12% to 15% target range for our operating basis return on common equity goal.","In conclusion, while we saw signs of improvement in the U.S. during the first quarter, that improvement seemed to slow a bit during the second quarter given the uncertainty that exists in the Eurozone. We still face a low interest rate environment, new regulatory requirements and increased compliance costs. We remain focused on growing our revenue modestly, controlling expenses and executing on our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay to conclude our remarks.","Joseph L. Hooley","Thanks, Ed. Although we maintain business momentum through the second quarter, the increased weakening of global macroeconomics later in the quarter, especially the situation in Europe, leaves us with a cautious outlook for the remainder of 2012.","Our clients reacted to the uncertain environment by reducing risk in their investment choices, moving from U.S. and emerging market equities to bond funds. However, we did achieve positive net new business in the servicing segment of our business.","We're pleased that our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program is on track with our plans and is contributing to the achievement of our 2012 goals.","Our capital position remains very strong, allowing us to return capital to our shareholders in the form of a quarterly common stock dividend, stock buybacks and through strategic acquisitions.","We look forward to closing the acquisition of the Goldman Sachs' hedge fund servicing business, which we believe will benefit our shareholders over the long term, and which enables us to expand our hedge fund client base in this fast-growing market. Now Ed and I are happy to entertain your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just a quick wrap-up on the Goldman deal, makes plenty of sense strategically in line with everything you've done in the past, and you've got a lot of capital sitting around, so I get it. I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you tell anything about revenue earnings impact and any of the main assumptions you get to on the -- be accretable in the first year?","Joseph L. Hooley","No, we didn't report that. We just reported it was some $200 billion in assets under management, 150 customers. But just reported the conclusion. On a cash basis, it's accretive in the first year.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. So I should stop trying on the spot [ph] assumptions, right? I have a bunch of follow-up questions on that?","Edward J. Resch","Yes.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, cool. And then on the Basel III. I think this got a lot of attention so far this morning. I was just wondering if you could oversimplify it for us. Walking from the 12.7% to the 9.8% and back to the 12.7% in that great table you laid out, what are the securities that are getting the biggest increase in the risk weighting? And that -- is that just a runoff of them getting back to the 12.7%? And over what period of time do you get the bulk of that?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, Glenn. I mean, it is basically the effect that I explained in my comments, where the higher rated securities, apparently, we have a lot of AAA-rated securities that are adversely treated under this proposal, may serve to increase our risk-weighted assets. Okay? And offsetting that are some of the lower-rated securities, the ones that are currently subject to the securitization deduction, under current rules, that actually benefit us from a risk-weighted asset perspective. Okay? So you have 2 opposing comments going on there in terms of the risk-weighted asset calculation. And that is what's moving the ratio down to the 9.8%. And conversely, going back up to the 12.7%, there's 2 things going on. One, the portfolio runoff that is scheduled to occur between now and December 31, 2014, so another 1.5 years or so before the -- I'm sorry, 2.5 years, before the implementation date of 1\/1\/15. As well as, if we need to, potential management actions to get the ratio back to the 12.7%, which is where we started from.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I guess the main thing is this is highly likely included in your CCAR plan and approved, and you're not changing the way you conduct business. I know I'm putting words in your mouth, but is that correct?","Edward J. Resch","Well, it's not included in the CCAR plan that was just approved, because the rules have just been issued. I would expect that it will be factored in to the next CCAR. But more importantly, the bigger point that you raise is right, we're not changing the way that we conduct business based on this. We feel like we have ample capital, enough room to react to this if we need to. Remember the rules are proposed, they're not final. And a lot could change between now and implementation date.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And a follow-up on the Greek securities sale, and I apologize if I missed this, too. But did you say what exactly they were? What -- where they were held? And if all the mark-to-market was taken this quarter?","Edward J. Resch","I didn't, but I'm happy to go into it with you. There were 5 bonds. They were all RMBS. They were held in our investment portfolio and held to maturity. They totaled $91 million of principal amount, and we booked a $46 million loss on them. It's a total exit of our Greek position. We thought that given the uncertainty in Europe, and more specifically, the extraordinary events in Greece, that it was wise -- and we did this before the election on June 17, it was wise for us to exit the position.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Got it. And I take it you're assessing the other periphery -- the securities held in the other periphery on the same basis right now?","Edward J. Resch","Well, yes, I mean, obviously, there is still a lot of disruption in the Eurozone. We have about $900 million of securities in the peripheral countries, they are virtually all RMBS. They're all performing well, with the exception of a handful of a couple of bonds that are on our watch list. But we don't think that the situation, as it relates to those specific securities that we hold, is anywhere close to our analysis of what we saw as the potential on the Greek position, which is why we sold the Greek position and we still are holding securities in the other peripheral countries.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, now, that's very helpful. Last one is just curious...","S. Kelley MacDonald","Glenn, we really need to move along. We've kind of given you a little bit of our time. But you can get back to me, Kevin or Valerie, later today and we could be helpful.","Edward J. Resch","Yes. I'm happy to get back on, Glenn.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on capital. I just wanted to -- from a big picture perspective, you've got the NPR changes, 75 to 80 basis points also from the deal today. So as you look forward, does this at all change the way you're looking at the buyback? Will you continue to pour through the buyback as planned in this year's allowable? And then will it change at all the way you think about capital return into next year and acquisitions as well?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, Ken, let me pick that up. The proposed acquisition of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund administration business will go through a regulatory approval process. And we'll conclude, based on that, the deal, hopefully, in the fourth quarter is our current plan. I guess the point about capital decisions, I go back to the kind of point in time, we plan to continue to execute the buyback. But should other acquisition opportunities come along, we would evaluate those from a standpoint of shareholder return versus continuing to buy back our stock based on what's outstanding and where the stock is trading. So our plan is to continue it, but it could be interrupted by other possible acquisition opportunities.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But that will -- okay. So -- and that's my second question, was just related to -- you're talking about using 75, 80 basis points of capital on something that will be cash accretive but GAAP dilutive next year. First of all, can you talk about when this deal will turn to GAAP accretive, and any magnitude, if you can help us on that? And then secondly, how do you think through that deals versus buyback? Is it in fact the trade-off? I thought it was always supposed to be kind of separate from however you think through your buyback? And what changed? Did something change with this NPR restatement?","Edward J. Resch","Yes. I mean, nothing has changed in terms of our thinking relative to the NPR, Ken. The deal on a GAAP basis is slightly dilutive currently. It will turn to be accretive out in 2014, 2015, in that timeframe. But the thinking has not changed. I mean, we're in a bit of a unique position, I think, in that the pure numerical analysis of buyback versus acquisition is somewhat constrained because of the CCAR and the plan that we have approved, okay? So it's not a pure analysis of one versus the other. The way that we looked at this transaction was it made sense. It was strategic. It was opportunistic. Obviously, it may not necessarily been here in the future. And we had a CCAR plan approved. So we thought it made sense to do it. Going forward, as I said before, it depends how the Fed factors the Basel III proposals, and I underscore proposals, into the next CCAR and what effect that has on any potential capital distribution next year or any potential acquisitions.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right. Okay. And then last little one, just on other expenses was much higher this quarter versus last, anything you can point out in there?","Edward J. Resch","Sure. Yes. Other expenses are really 2 things going on. One was our securities processing costs. We're comparing a low quarter, Q1 actually had a credit for those securities processing cost, a small credit, but it's relevant to a higher level of securities processing expenses in Q2. So you've got that delta. And then you have a ramp up in professional services, Q1 to Q2. That's driven by 2 things. One, these regulatory initiatives were talking so much about. We're spending on -- spending money on professional services in order to evaluate them. And two, the expenses associated with the transformation program. Those also incur some professional services, some consulting costs. So those 2 things are the drivers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You're making really good progress on the long-term transformation program. But could we just get an update on the asset servicing competitive landscape or the conversations on pricing changing or the composition of what clients are asking for a change and all?","Joseph L. Hooley","Sure. Let me take a good shot at that, Howard. The -- on the asset servicing, second quarter, you saw that revenues were up 1%. We just begin to frame the question. S&P was up slightly quarter-to-quarter. The EAFE average daily was down, I think, 7%. So that performance was constrained by the market. The -- I'd say from a standpoint of market activity, pipeline, deal flow, pretty constant through the quarter. I'd say the demand is high and pretty consistent from a standpoint of customer deal flow and prospect pipeline. I'd say on the pricing point, which is the other point you raised, the longer this environment hangs around and the more constraining it is on some of our revenue lines, the more aggressive, I'd say aggressive, or the more formalized our plans are to make sure that we're capturing fair economics from our customers. So we have a pretty broad-based effort underway across, obviously, only those customers that require some remediation to get the margin up to our target margin internally, and have gone out to customers with requests for increases in fees, broader servicing relationships in order to correct some of those situations. So I would characterize that as more of a journey as far as the pricing environment. From a standpoint of the competitive pricing environment, I would say it's mixed. It's probably mix by geography, mix by asset class, but generally, it doesn't feel that changed from prior quarters. Did that capture, Howard, your -- the essence of your question?","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, that was very comprehensive. And Ed, on the NPR, you focused a lot of your commentary on the risk weightings for securitized assets and the non-investment grade securities. But putting those 2 elements aside, do you have any thoughts on some of the other factors that we heard about, including counter-party risk and the supplemental leverage ratio and potential impact on you all?","Edward J. Resch","Well, our analysis so far on those other elements is ongoing. And our view is that a lot of them are immaterial to us and net probably don't have much of an effect on us. The 2 things that I mentioned in the call are the ones that we're the most focused on, and I think, potentially have the most effect, which is the mark, OCI and the SSFA, Howard.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then final one, you have both been really conservative about the FX outlook and what mix shift you might see. I guess with all that said, I would have thought maybe we could see a sequential quarter-on-quarter lift to given international dividend season? I mean, could you just put a little bit more content around what you already said in the prepared remarks, Ed?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, I mean, we saw both the sales and trading and the indirect FX both down sequential quarter. It was across-the-board in both of the areas. Indirect FX volumes were down a bit. The FX sales and trading, which includes direct, the volumes were up a little bit. But overall, it was a quarter where it was tough in our FX business, Howard.","Joseph L. Hooley","And our FX business would be proportionately more tied to the core asset servicing business. So some of the derisking or the lack of risking that went on with regard to emerging market investing and global investing obviously had a bearing on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just one more on the Basel III. I assume the ratio out to 2015, of 12.7%, that assumes no -- or I guess what level of buyback does that assume? Is it really just at the second quarter share levels and assumes no buybacks? Or do you have an assumption in there?","Edward J. Resch","Continuing at the current rate.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Continuing at the second quarter pace through that, through the end of 2014?","Edward J. Resch","Yes.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. Okay. And Ed, going back to your comments on the revenue growth -- and maybe this is a question for both Ed and Jay. So in terms of your new modest revenue growth assumption, obviously, a little bit at risk with the environment being a little trickier. What -- to what degree do you think the comp revenue ratio will be pressuring that? You were saying, obviously, trying to get to about 39%, if we have a more, say, flat to slightly up revenue year in 2012 versus 2011, what would -- roughly, what would you envision the comp revenue ratio to be? And then, adding onto that for Jay, if you can talk a little bit about client derisking at the end of the second quarter. If you think that's a material impact to third quarter realization rates and the servicing business?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, I'll take the first one, Brian. I mean, we start off at 40.2%, the last year's ratio. We said we'd target 39.2% for this year, assuming modest revenue growth. Now the first half of this year versus last year, revenue growth is about 0.6%. So it's pretty modest 6 months year-to-date, which is why I said that if second half is relatively weaker, the 39.2% target is going to be very, very difficult to achieve. It's hard to put a point estimate on it. But I mean, I would think we're talking about 39.5%, 39.6%, something like that, if revenue in the second half of the year is challenged. I mean, we're not going to do anything relative to compensation just to hit 39.2%, if revenue is not strong. I mean, we have to balance out the needs of everybody, shareholders, employees, et cetera, to make sure that we're maintaining the appropriate level of staffing for the business.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And that's still year-on-year progress, isn't that? I would regard that as good.","Joseph L. Hooley","And Brian, to your other question. The volatility here just continues. If you think back to the first quarter, the first quarter started out slow and then the back end of the first quarter, clients began to re-risk as we get into the second quarter. Mid-point, the re-risking went to derisking. So I just think, we are cautious because as we look out from where we sit here, we have worries about the U.S., the election cycle, the fiscal cliff. Europe is, at times, day-to-day, if not week-to-week. So we sit looking forward saying, \"It's hard to envision a short-term scenario where there will be a shift back to re-risking.\" That could happen, but we're not planning for it, which is why we make the cautious comments.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right, right, that's helpful. And then just lastly on the securities processing costs, Ed. Can you frame how much that impacted the second quarter in terms of higher level versus the credit in the first quarter?","Edward J. Resch","In the range of $0.03.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So wanted to go back to the capital question just one more time, I guess. In previous discussions, I think we talked about potentially the regulators looking at Basel III framework a little bit more in determining how they will allow banks return capital in 2013 and beyond. How does that change? How does this revision, I guess, change your view on whether or not you might be able to return the same level of capital kind of post this year?","Edward J. Resch","Well, I mean, we don't know. We have to see how the rules evolve, what the comments are. I've outlined what we're planning on commenting on at this point, the 2 big items I noted. And we have to see how the regulators factor these proposals or maybe some revisions to the proposals in their thinking about the next CCAR. We just don't know at this point.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. And then on net interest margin and I appreciate guidance you guys give around some sensitivity into the back half of the year. But I guess looking at the balances, can you give us a little bit more granularity on maybe where the deposits sort of sit with you guys, with which central banks versus the Fed or the ECB, just to get a sense of the sensitivity from here, if there's further rate cuts?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, they're mainly with the Fed, but they're also in part with the ECB. And they can ebb and flow, Alex. It depends where those deposits actually come in. Right now, the excess deposits are largely DDA in the U.S. So we're leaving them at the Fed, principally.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the last question that I have for you guys is just on bigger picture on the margins, which you look at over the last, call it, 2 quarters. Your pre-tax margins is in the high 20s, call it 28%, 29%. If you go back to when you announced the program, you were kind of in this high 20% range still. It feels like, call it, $100 million of the program on a net savings basis is already in the run rate. That's a good chunk, I think, of what the -- of the total savings that you outlined. But the margin hasn't really moved. So I guess what gives us some -- can you give us some confidence, I guess, around that 400 basis points of margin expansion given the fact that so far we really haven't seen any?","Edward J. Resch","Yes. I mean, remember, we pegged that margin improvement off of the 2010 results. And obviously, the world has changed since 2010. So the answer is a complex one, but I'll try to take you through it because we breakdown how we think about the margin in terms of various categories to try to frame the changes from 2010. So starting with the effect of transformation. We think we've gotten around 100 basis points of transformation. This is June year-to-date 2012 versus June year-to-date 2011. So that's the relevant -- that's the right way, we think, to look at it, 6 months versus 6 months. So there's 100 basis points of improvement there. You have some one-timers which need to be adjusted for. Those reduce the margins by about 90 basis points. So they roughly offset the effect of transformation right there. And then if you look at the core business, which includes market impact, that's down, in terms of margin, about 1.5%, given the environment that we're operating in. Okay? So those are the 3 broad buckets, Alex, that we look at in terms of the margin effect, giving recognition to the achievement of the ops and IT transformation savings.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. I guess, said another way, if you look at -- to get to your 400 basis points of margin expansion, I guess, what did you guys assume for revenue growth for the next few years?","Edward J. Resch","We assumed various levels of revenue growth and just struck a number. And it really didn't matter much, frankly. We just assumed revenue growth grew at, pick a percentage, Alex, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 10%, whatever. And we also increased expenses at the same growth rate. Not making any assumptions about operating leverage. Okay? Just to simplify things. Obviously, we target operating leverage, we say that every year. But just for this model, bring expenses and revenue up at the same rate from 2010 and add in the $600 million savings, and then you'll see that approximately the margin increases by around 400 basis points. It doesn't matter what revenue growth you took, as long as expenses grow at the same rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of questions. Firstly, one small clarification. Let me get that out of the way. There was a securities loss in your reported earnings, but a securities gain in the operator, can you just clarify why the difference and what causes that?","Edward J. Resch","Sure. We recorded the Greek exit as nonoperating. Our thinking there was that it was unique, extraordinary, given the circumstances in Europe, and particularly Greece. And we exited an entire position in the country, Vivek. Okay? So it's something that we think is more appropriately viewed as nonoperating, given that our view of operating should be to give the reader a view of the core earnings power of the company. And I think if we're talking about exiting a position or several -- 5 positions, specifically in Greece, at the class of item is operating, that would be, in my view anyway, not the appropriate way to look at it. In operating earnings, we have both purchases and sales, some gains, some losses that are at the margin, if you will. And we've done those over time and we report them as part of the core earnings of the company, and we had that this quarter, too.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, okay, okay. That's an easy one. Let's go back -- I want to go back to the buyback question that's been asked. So looking at your 9.7% Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, that would be, I guess, 9% if the acquisition were pro forma that of June 30. And you said you've continued to buy back at the current pace that you have in the second quarter, you intend to continue that. But if you do that, that would have no growth in the capital ratios, because essentially you're buying -- you bought back almost as much as you made in net income. And given that your target at your Investor Day was to try and keep your Tier 1 common at 10%, can you reconcile how you get to 10% if you're going to be -- when would you get to 10%? Since I know you've said there's going to be some runoff in securities. But clearly, looking back over the last few quarters, it hasn't run off that fast that it's led to any improvement in the capital ratio. Your Tier 1 common didn't really change if we adjust for OCI, quarter-over-quarter from Q1 to Q2?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, I mean, it's not much of an OCI effect, right? But the growth from the 9.7% up to 10% and over 10% will occur over the next 2.5 years from the mid-point this year to the end of 2014, as those securities that are subject to the higher risk weighting run off.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And so are these what the AAA's subprime asset-backed that you have moved into your -- that were part of the conduit that have been moved to held to maturity that you're hoping will pay down over time? And does it come more in '13 or is it more back-ended? Can you give any more color?","Edward J. Resch","No, it's not those securities at all, Vivek. It's some of our actually higher rated, we believe higher-quality RMBS securities. Some, mostly foreign, that are driving the increase in risk weighted assets. And that is actually offset by a benefit on some of the securities that I think your question refers to. Okay? Some of the lower-rated securities that some of which we sold in 2010 in order to reposition the portfolio. Those securities are actually benefiting in this calculation.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So you're thinking that your 9.7% goes to 9%. And then you still intending to stick to the 10% target?","Edward J. Resch","Yes. And 9.7% going to 9% is just layering in the Goldman Sachs' acquisition in those calculations, right?","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And how long do you think does it take for you to get back to 10%?","Joseph L. Hooley","1 year.","Edward J. Resch","1 year. Certainly by the end of 2013.","Operator","Our final question comes from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just on the derisking commentary. It sounds like it wasn't fully reflected in this quarter's run rate. How do we think about the go-forward implications from the derisking stepping down, and maybe put in the context of what we saw last year, if possible?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes. It's a hard one to answer, Andrew. I attempted to do that a few questions ago by talking about -- the first quarter had the same dynamic, which is the derisking started slow and then people re-risked in the second half of the first quarter, and now we've cycled back down again. So I think you should look at it more from a go-forward perspective of the U.S. and European markets and whether the confidence steps down again or whether it remains where it is right now. I mean, that's really what I'm signaling.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. It seems like in the fourth quarter, even last year, like that was maybe more reflective kind of in the numbers. Is that fair?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, that is fair.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Is that how we should think about it going forward? Or are we not there yet in terms of kind of just if you were to rank them or put them in a magnitude?","Joseph L. Hooley","It's just that it's hard to give you a signal on that.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then in terms of the comp to revenue target. It sounds like modest revenue growth, less confidence in that now. How do you guys think about modest? What is the definition of modest? And why even kind of keep that target out there if there is less confidence?","Edward J. Resch","Well, I mean, I've used the term modest and the way that I have defined it without putting a point estimate on it, Andrew, is to say, clearly, 60 basis points first 6 months, the first 6 months. 1% or 2% is not modest, and 7% or 8% is above modest. Okay? So it's somewhere in between. That was our thinking coming into the year. But based on the first half results, that thinking is lower.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a ticky-tack question on the processing fee line. It came in at $48 million this quarter, I know there was some noise last quarter, too. How should we think about it going forward? Is that -- second quarter, is some of that non-repeatable? Or should we go back to 70, 75 type quarterly range or are we resetting lower?","Edward J. Resch","We're not resetting lower. I mean, I'd say, again, it's tough to predict the line. But I think I've said in the past, 70, 75 per quarter is probably a good number to use. This quarter was significantly below that for a couple of reasons that I think I touched on it in my script.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then the tax rate, just the last ticky-tack, tax rate also lower?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, yes.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Is it also reset lower. Or should we also think about it kind of going back to the 27, 28?","Edward J. Resch","No. I think we're -- in our press release, I think we signaled that we expect 25% to 26% effective for the full year. And that's a combination of 2 things. One, the overall mix of revenue. We're obviously getting some advantage there. And then secondly, we have, and this is one of the benefits in the second quarter, a renewable energy investment which is generating some positive tax effects and will be for the full year.","Joseph L. Hooley","Thank you. I appreciate all your time this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again after the third quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the conference.

Our performance in the fourth quarter reflects the continued challenges presented throughout 2015 including the challenging global equity markets particularly in emerging markets, persistent low interest rates, strengthening U.S. dollar and heightened regulatory expectations. We were successful at managing expenses in the quarter in light of the pressure on revenues. In addition, we grew fee revenue in 2015 and achieved strong new business results as evidenced by new asset servicing commitments of $300 billion this quarter and approximately $800 billion for the full year.","The challenging conditions notwithstanding, overall I'm disappointed with our full year 2015 performance and how we performed against the various goals we set. We generated 2% operating basis fee revenue growth compared to 2014, which was short of our goal of 4% to 7%. On a constant currency basis our operating base fee revenue was 5.3%. We also fell short of our objective of generating at least 200 basis points of positive fee operating leverage compared to 2014 as we posted a 79 basis point difference in growth. In addition to the challenging revenue environment we experienced regulatory compliance costs and operating losses at a higher level than expected.","Actual net interest revenue was in line with our outlook, which reflected the continued low interest rate environment and our balance sheet optimization actions. Our efforts to optimize our balance have resulted in lower excess deposits and stronger capital ratios compared to the levels at the end of 2014, position us well for our long-term capital plan. Lastly, returning capital to our shareholders remains a top priority. We increased our quarterly common share dividend to $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2015, an annualized increase of 14% from 2014 and bought back $1.52 billion in common shares in 2015.","As you may have already noted the fourth quarter's results also include a number of items and legal settlements, which we have worked hard to address and put behind us so that we can turn our complete focus on growing our business and improving our operations. Mike Bell will discuss how these items impacted our financial statements.","Now I would like to discuss our asset servicing and asset management businesses. We added $300 billion of new servicing commitments during the quarter across all sectors and geographies. The difficult global market environment in 2015 put significant pressure on our clients, creating a positive environment for cross-selling and clients consolidating their service business with fewer providers. Our asset management business experienced net outflows of $19 billion during the fourth quarter of 2015, driven primarily by new outflows of $19 billion from institutional passive mandates and $10 billion in net outflows from cash mandates primarily from securities lending cash collaterals, partially offset by $11 billion of inflows through ETFs.","Institutional net outflows were primarily driven by client asset allocation shifts and an expected redemption of one large sub-advisory client that is in-sourcing the business. Redemptions by this client are expected to continue through the remainder of 2016 and assets under management associated with this client was approximately $35 billion at the end of 2015. The low headline net outflows were negative, annualized revenue impact on flows was positive $10 million due to a favorable underlying business mix.","During the fourth quarter of 2015 we had approximately $11 billion of positive net flows into our ETFs, including approximately $4.5 billion of inflows for SPY our S&P 500 ETF. We continue to invest in our ETFs with a further 13 new launches in the fourth quarter bringing total 2015 launches to 35. Significant fourth quarter launches included three smart beta ETFs and a natural resources ETF, that immediately ranked in the top 10 launches in the U.S. in 2015. In addition, the SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF was the top product launched in the U.S. in 2015 with $1.8 billion inflows. Overall, our SPDR ETF business had five of the top 10 new product launched in the U.S. with combined assets gathered across all new launches of $4.3 billion.","Going into 2016, we continue to focus on what we can control and to do our best to address those elements we cannot control. As we know, the start of year in global markets has not been good, but regardless of the implications to revenues it is our objective to strive to generate positive fee operating leverage. We started the year with new assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods of $378 billion at December 31st, and we continue to see deep and diverse pipelines, which should help our fee revenues. Our overall strategy is well positioned against global markets, which we believe over the long-term will deliver accelerated growth opportunities.","Knowing we are off to a difficult start in 2016 we're focused on identifying leverage to improve our performance in 2016 and help us outperform in the current macro-environment. This includes a focus on managing expenses that is in addition to our multiyear transformation program and targeted staff reductions that we discussed on the Q3 '15 earnings call, which is called State Street Beacon. We currently expect State Street Beacon to generate approximately $550 million in the annualized pretax net run rate expense savings by the end of 2020 with approximately $75 million of that run rate savings being achieved in 2016.","State Street Beacon leverages the foundation built by our business operations and technology transformation program that was completed in 2014. The program will leverage your cloud infrastructure to drive next generation platforms in order to improve scale and flexibility. Digitization of services and solutions will enable automated access across and improve interfaces with our clients. We expect the end result of the program to produce a lower cost client centric integrated operating model delivering timely information to our global exchange platforms. Not only will we continue our firm-wide focus on expenses, but we are also looking for more ways to accelerate revenue growth through cross-selling and product innovation. I am encouraged by some of the developments we've already seen through our digitization work particularly the data solutions we can offer our customers.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mike, who will review our financial performance for the fourth quarter and then we will be available to take your call -- take your questions. Mike?","Mike Bell","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I'll comment on two significant items that affected our 4Q '15 GAAP basis results as highlighted on Slide 5. First, we recorded a 4Q '15 charge of approximately $17 million and a liability of approximately $240 million related to the matter in which we invoiced certain expenses to asset servicing clients primarily in the U.S. during an 18 year period. The current period charge reflects an accrual for interest that we intend to pay to the impacted clients. $223 million of the liability or $145 million after tax relates to periods prior to the 2015 fiscal year and appears in the beginning routine earnings balance of our statement of shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2014.","Please note all prior period financial information within this Slide deck and within our earnings release and addendum have been revised to reflect the impact of the reimbursement on each prior period presented. In addition, we recorded an $82 million pretax gain or $49 million after tax related to the final payoff of a commercial real estate loan acquired as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.","Now please turn to Slide 9 in the slide presentation for a summary of our operating basis results for 4Q '15 and for full year of 2015. Both 4Q '15 and 2015 full year results reflect the headwinds from challenging global equity market conditions, low interest rates, a stronger U.S. dollar and heightened regulatory expenses. Full year 2015 EPS decreased 3% from 2014 reflecting lower NIR and higher expenses particularly due to the heightened regulatory expectations, partially offset by fee growth and the continued execution of our common stock purchase program.","Our pretax operating margin of 29.1% and ROE of 10.7% decreased relative to 2014. Compared to full year 2014, full year 2015 fee revenue was negatively impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar largely offset by a similar benefit in total expenses. On a constant currency basis fees grew by 5.3% versus full year 2014.","Turning to 4Q '15 EPS of $1.21 decreased from $1.36 in the year ago quarter and increased from $1.15 in 3Q '15. Our capital ratios improved sequentially and from year-end 2014 reflecting management actions to reduce risk weighted assets and to also reduce the level of excess deposits on our balance sheet. As we\u2019ve discussed we are particularly pleased with our progress on this priority over the second half of 2015. Additionally, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 per share and purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock.","Turning to Slide 12, I'll discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue from 4Q '15. Servicing fees decreased primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower international equity markets partially offset by net new business. The decrease in international equity markets particularly in emerging markets continues to negatively impact servicing fees. Compared to the year ago quarter, average daily values for the Morgan Stanley Emerging Market Index decreased 16%, while the EFA equity index was down approximately 4%. We estimate that approximately 10% of our servicing fees are tied to emerging markets.","4Q '15 management fees decreased relative to a year ago primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, net outflows, and lower international equity markets. Foreign exchange revenue decreased due to the lower volatility in volumes. Securities finance revenue increased from 4Q '14 primarily due to new business and enhanced custody and was higher than 3Q '15 primarily reflecting higher spreads. The increase in processing fees and other revenue from 4Q '14 and 3Q '15 reflects higher revenue associated with tax advantaged investments.","It's also important to note that this line item, which has a number of elements within it, did experience volatility from quarter-to-quarter was higher in 4Q '15 than normal. In addition, the 4Q '15 revenue also benefited from tax advantage investment seasonality, so we expect to find that to be a little bit lower in 1Q '16.","Moving to Slide 13, you can see that our operating basis net interest revenue continued to be pressured by the prolonged low interest rate environment. The decrease in 4Q '15 average earning assets and corresponding increase in the net interest margin reflects the efforts to reduce client deposits that largely occurred towards the end of the third quarter.","Now let's turn to Slide 14 to review 4Q '15 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses decreased 3% compared to both 3Q '15 and the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation and other expenses. Other expenses included a $12 million settlement with the SEC related to the previously disclosed allegations of improper conduct in the solicitation of asset servicing business.","Now turning to Slide 16 to review our capital position. As you can see our capital ratios remained strong, which has enabled us to accomplish a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock purchases. Importantly at December 31st our common equity Tier 1 ratio under both the Basel III fully phased-in advanced and standardized approach increased from September 30th principally due to lower risk-weighted assets. The December 31st fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the bank also increased to 5.7% on a fully phased-in basis principally due to the full quarter effect of our proactive efforts to reduce client deposits in September.","Moving to Slide 17, let me review the financial details of the State Street Beacon program. We expect to achieve annual pretax net run rate expense savings of approximately $550 million by the end of 2020. In 2016, we expect to achieve $75 million in annual pretax net run rate expense savings, which includes the savings associated with the reduction in force that we announced in 3Q '15. In 2017, we expect to achieve an additional pretax net run rate expense savings of at least a $125 million. Included in the targeted $550 million in annual pretax net run rate expense savings are ongoing investments to support the program.","Importantly, we expect State Street Beacon to improve our operating basis pretax profit margin to at least 31% by 2018 and to 33% by the end of 2020 all else equal. To accomplish our savings targets, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $300 million to $400 million from 2016 through 2020 and we look forward to providing a further update at our Investor Day on February 24th.","Now let's move onto Slide 18 and 19 for a review for our 2016 financial outlook. During 2016, we remain focused on our key priorities of returning capital to shareholders, prudently managing expenses and investing in the business to provide solutions to our clients. Although we anticipate that the environment will continue to be challenging in 2016, managing expenses is a high priority. It is our objective to generate positive fee operating leverage relative to 2015. Now please be aware that the year-to-date weakness in the equity markets will adversely affect total revenue. As a reminder a 10% decline in global equity markets is expected to result in approximately 2% of downward pressure on our total revenue.","While upward pressure on regulatory and compliance cost is expected to continue in 2016, we expect the growth rate of regulatory and compliance expenses to be lower than 2015. We also expect expense growth to be affected by new business as well as continued investments. Also it's important to highlight that as in prior years the first quarter 2016 compensation and employee benefits expense will be seasonally higher due to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation for retirement eligible employees as well as for payroll taxes and associated benefits. We expect the incremental amount attributed to equity compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter of 2016 to be in a range of approximately $130 million to $140 million.","As you can see, we developed two scenarios for 2016 net interest revenue. The first scenario assumes market interest rates remain static at current levels. Under this scenario, we expect full-year 2016 NIR to be in the range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. The second scenario assumes administered rates in the U.S. increase 25 basis points in both March and June and in the U.K. rates increase 25 basis points in both May and August. Under this scenario, we expect full-year 2016 NIR to be in the range of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Additionally, we expect the (2006) (sic) (2016) operating basis tax rate to be in a range of 30% to 32%.","Turning to the last slide, I would emphasize that returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends remains a high priority. Our 2016 capital plan remains subject to the results of the 2016 CCAR process including a review by the Federal Reserve Board.","Now before I turn the call over to Jay, I would like to inform all of you that David Gutschenritter, the Company Treasurer has informed me of his intention to retire after 11 years with State Street. Dave has been an incredible positive force in his role as Treasurer. As the industry evolved and the regulatory environment became more complex, Dave brought the talent, processes and leadership needed to assure our continued success. We will miss him tremendously. Dave has agreed to stay on in an advisory capacity through July 30th to ensure orderly transition of his responsibilities. And as part of our succession plan, the Board of Directors has elected Tracy Atkinson to Treasurer affective February 1st.","In addition to a number of other leadership roles in finance, Tracy has had oversight for Global Treasury for the past five years, so we expect her transition to the Treasurer role to be smooth. Dave has had close relationships with many of you over the last several years and for those of you attending our Investor Day next month, they will have the opportunity to wish him well.","Now, I'm going to turn the call back over to Jay.","Jay Hooley","Thanks, Mike. Crystal, we are all set to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Maybe Mike and Jay if you can talk a little bit about the market assumptions that you have underlying the assumption of generating stronger fee growth in 2016 versus the operating expenses? And then maybe if you could just give a little bit more color on what you\u2019re thinking about for operating expenses on an absolute basis in '16 versus '15? Thanks.","Jay Hooley","I am sorry Brian, can you just repeat the end of that second part of your question?","Brian Bedell","So on the expense side, if you can give us a little bit more color on how you\u2019re thinking about the absolute level of expenses of operating expenses in 2016 versus '15?","Mike Bell","Okay. So, that\u2019s helpful Brian. I\u2019ll handle both of those. First, in terms of your question on the market assumptions, candidly Brian, given all the uncertainty in the market environment, I am really reluctant to give you at this point a concrete forecast and that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t include that in the prepared remarks and in the slide presentation. I am sure it's not lost on you that the equity markets thus far in January for example are down high single digits and the emerging markets even worse. And particularly with our mix of business that would be a serious headwind. So instead we\u2019re really focused on achieving overall fee operating leverage in 2016 and we recognize that that would be more challenging if in fact equity markets remain uncooperative for the rest of the year. But we\u2019re focused on as Jay said what we can control. We feel good about the Beacon savings that we\u2019ll get in 2016. We recognize that there is some upward pressure on the regulatory expenses but we think that will be at a lower rate than what it's been in the last -- in 2015. And so we\u2019re really looking at managing really every expense dollar. And that really relates to your second question, which is, in terms of our overall expense growth plan, it will be largely dependant upon fee revenue. We intend to manage expenses at a lower rate than what our fees grow. And again it will be more challenging if the environment is difficult but that\u2019s our plan and that\u2019s why we\u2019re looking at every area of expenses, we\u2019re looking at management layers, we\u2019re looking at procurement, we\u2019re looking at outside consultants, we\u2019re looking at real estate, we\u2019re looking at low return businesses. I mean really we\u2019re looking at the entire spectrum with a goal of getting to that positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016.","Brian Bedell","And maybe just talk about the Beacon program a little bit more. Maybe just start with the trajectory at the $75 million and the actual -- the addition of the incremental $125 million in 2017. So from a timing perspective during the year, how should we be thinking of that that layering in the quarters?","Jay Hooley","Let me start and I\u2019ll let Mike answer the financial question. But let me just -- I think this will help you understand the pacing. If we go back to five, six years ago, we began with the IT and ops transformation emphasis on transformation. It was really to take our common systems, standardized processes, establish centers of excellence and we also introduced a public cloud and began to rewrite some of those core systems underlying those applications. Beacon takes it to the next step and I can\u2019t emphasize enough that you can\u2019t take the second step unless you have successfully taken the first step. The second step is to -- I\u2019d say wired together all of these different systems which in most financial institutions are not wired together on a real time basis.","So, in the future state of Beacon I\u2019ll use a simple example. In our fund accounting area, we would expect that an electronic trade invoice coming in from a customer would electronically in real time basis hit the security system, the cash system, the accounting system and update the pricing on a real time basis. So if you let your mind wander in a future state that means our whole environment becomes real time and you could dynamically price funds during the day. That will have the attendant benefits of obviously cost efficiency as you replace human intervention and disparate systems with fully integrated systems. It will also reduce errors and risk but probably most importantly and I keep covering this ground because I am not sure everybody fully appreciates the value of real time information upstream for our customers form office for purposes of risk management, investment management, et cetera.","So, that\u2019s the journey. Now let me come back to a little bit more narrowly on your question. This next stage of transformation heavily involves technology development and integration. And so there is a little bit of [comp] timing that we were doing in 2015, which will continue in 2016 in building the systems and the integration models, which means that the trajectory of cost saves will start out slowly and build over time. So out of the $550 million you can take the $75 million in '16, the $125 million in '17 that will just continue to build. I will say that the trajectory into a year would probably have a similar path. But Mike, I don\u2019t know if you want to add any color to that?","Mike Bell","Sure, Brian, the additional color that I would give you is it's important to note that the $75 million is intended to be a net number in terms of our operating expense impact in full year 2016 compared to operating expenses in full year 2015. So the bottom line is gross savings will be higher than $75 million, but there will be some net spending which in particular is very helpful to position us to get some additional savings in 2017 and 2018, which is even higher than what we'll deliver in 2016. So the spending I would expect to hit to impact Q1, and I agree with Jay, the savings in 2016 will mainly begin in Q2 and ramp throughout the year. So I expect a little bit of a bubble in Q1 and then net savings beginning in Q2 and accelerating through the remainder of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","I just wanted to clarify one thing on that expense comment, the $75 million in 2016, I think is not on top of the $50 million that you've mentioned at the time of the headcount reduction, correct? And that you said your intention is to be a net number '16 versus '15 full year?","Jay Hooley","Yes, both of those comments are correct, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, awesome. Curious I am talking about the investment portfolio, it was what you called ongoing repositioning of the investment portfolio. If you look at your appendix slide, it's now 64% fixed grade, so I am curious on what's driving that change and is it the duration extension on the government side and does that mean that -- what does that mean for your rate sensitivity?","Mike Bell","Sure, Glenn. So first of all in terms of the repositioning of the investment portfolio, you are correct that we have skinnied down in particular the floating rate assets that are -- had been denominated in U.S. dollars. And the reason for that is the same thing that we've talked about on earlier calls in 2015 and that is, those are primarily asset backed securities and they are relatively low spread assets compared to for example U.S. treasuries. They also don't get counted as favorably as U.S. treasuries do and they're treated relatively harshly in CCAR because if you recall at the last financial crises, spreads blew out for those assets and therefore the mark-to-market under the CCAR stress test is particularly unfavorable. So the U.S. dollar based floating rate securities in particular are -- I would characterize it is as the least attractive of the portfolio assets that we're on the books say a year ago. So that's been the major driver of wanting to move away from those assets. And in terms of your question on the rate sensitivity, again we look at the interest rates sensitivity through several different lenses and I feel very comfortable there has been no change in our philosophy. We continue to invest through the cycle. Again, we're working to optimize against a number of different regulatory expectations and constraints, but I would characterize it as no material change in our thinking around interest rate sensitivity.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Just one little follow-up on that, when you look at your margin targets, I think they included 100 basis points of hikes through the end of '17, so I am just going to guess and say 50-50 in '16 and '17. Is the math on the impact of the margin, if rates don't change, the same as the math that you gave us on a static and higher rates scenario? I mean, we talk about the same numbers I could just back into that and see that the impact on margin targets if rates don\u2019t change?","Mike Bell","Yes, Glenn, I think that's fair. We are going to provide an update at the February Investor Day around the longer term NIM ranges including static, including ideally getting to something like a 3\/5 long-term interest rate structure. I think the main pivotal point Glenn though is that I want to make this morning is that we do expect that the Beacon savings will fall to our bottom lines. We expect that the Beacon savings will be additive to profit margins. So when we say all else equal, we know that there will be other things going on in the world that are impacting margins. I think that you've mentioned NIR. NIR obviously can be separately highlighted and analyzed. But the bottom line, most pivotal comments that we're making is, we do expect the Beacon savings to be additive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Mike, you had good improvement on the Tier 1 leverage ratio which is your limiting ratio as we get into CCAR '16. And obviously with the challenges on the environment translating to challenges for your earnings run rate. I am just wondering, plus the restructuring charges still are coming in and affecting net income. Can you remind us again when you think about CCAR going forward how do you think about your payout ratio? Do you think about it on a net income number or do you think about it on an operating number? And how do these change in the environment if at all change your desire to get through the rest of the buyback to the extent you had recently got an approval and change your thinking at all for going forward?","Mike Bell","Sure Ken, I appreciate the question. First, let me just comment on your first piece, because I think it was a very important point and that is, as you can imagine for CCAR, reducing our excess deposits by approximately $36 billion over the second half of 2015 is particularly helpful for us going into CCAR. And obviously we don\u2019t have the CCAR instructions yet, the specifics around the stress test. But any way you slice it, we\u2019re really pleased with the progress that we made and we feel good about the position we\u2019ll be in for the next CCAR, particularly relative to what we would have been in if we hadn\u2019t reduced the deposits.","On your specific question around the income, both income majors are very relevant. The net income major is relevant and also the operating income is relevant. First the operating income really represents Ken our best estimate of what our run rate earnings are. So, if you think about what the next three or four years are going to be, the operating income is what we think of as the starting point ideally to grow then over the next several years. So I think that\u2019s a very important data point for the upcoming CCAR. Having said that, net income obviously impacts capital, and so left to only that one issue, the restructuring charges or the FX settlement charges that we took in the first and second quarter of 2015 or even this out of pocket issue, all of that decreased capital essentially dollar for dollar, which is why it's very important for us to be managing capital as aggressively as we can.","Because at the end of the day what we believe to be our binding constraint is actually our overall capital ratios and in particular the next CCAR test will show what does that capital position look like under the stress test. So that\u2019s maybe a longer winded answer than you may have been looking for, but the bottom line is both of those income numbers matter, because the operating income will be more predictive or we expect to be more predictive of what our future income will be. But the net income impacts the capital position that we\u2019re sitting here with today dollar for dollar.","Ken Usdin","Thanks Mike. And if I can just then follow up just on the balance sheet, you said $36 billion reduction second half. So can you just -- what was the excess deposits at the end of the year and would you continue to expect additional roll down of those going forward or have you worked it to the point where it's now more manageable? And perhaps you won\u2019t need -- I guess the question is do you have any incremental need left after all this reduction for any preferreds?","Mike Bell","So, Ken first to answer your factual question, we estimate that under our historical methodology our excess deposits averaged approximately $26 billion in Q4. Now as we\u2019ve talked about before, that\u2019s the historical definition under the LCR rules, some of what we\u2019ve thought of as operational deposits no longer account so at some point we\u2019re going to flip over to a definition of non-operational deposits that for example would include deposits we have with hedge funds and private equity relationships. And even though those are normal operations with our custody relationships there, for LCR purposes they are accounted as non-operational. But to answer your question factually $26 billion versus our average at Q2 was $62 billion, so a $36 billion reduction there.","On your question on the -- are we going to push harder and what about the issue around prefs. First of all, Ken the short answer would be that we\u2019re really pleased with what we\u2019ve accomplished. And this has not been a trivial exercise. This is an issue that\u2019s a sensitive one for a number of our clients. And so the fact that we feel good that we got to a win-win with our clients after all these discussions, we think that got us to a real good point. So I would say at this point we don\u2019t feel compelled to drive more off of the balance sheet relative to where they were for example in Q4. But it is something that we\u2019re going to monitor carefully. It is something that\u2019s subject to market conditions. The situation in Europe for example is just not helpful at all. I mean with the ECB cutting to minus 30, talking about possibly cutting further, credit spreads have come in dramatically in Europe because of their quantity of easing. So, for all those reasons, I think we have to continue to monitor this but at this point I feel good about where we are.","Now your question on prefs is one of those I can\u2019t yet answer fully, because we don\u2019t have the CCAR stress test. I mean obviously we\u2019re in a much better position but until we see the dynamics around that stress test and go through that modeling over the next 60 days. I am just not in a position to give you an estimate at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery","I just wanted to take another quick stab at Brian's question on the 2016 outlook, maybe you've answered it but it wasn't clear to me. When you establish the positive fee operating leverage goal, did you factor in the decline you had in the markets year-to-date or are you assuming year end market levels?","Mike Bell","Luke, it's Mike. We certainly factored in what we know about markets as of today, and I think deep down we feel like there's more opportunity for improvement over the course of the year, but I think the most important thing is that we are focused Luke on controlling expenses. The item that we can -- that's within -- best within our control. And we do expect, again barring a catastrophe in terms of further deterioration in markets to be able to get to that net all-in positive fee operating leverage for the full year. Now again it is something that -- because it is subject to market conditions, it's probably something that we want to update you on at the Investor Day in February, at each subsequent quarter our focus and Luke I guarantee the management team is really galvanized around this. Collectively our focus is to generate positive fee operating leverage for the full year.","Luke Montgomery","Okay thanks. And then just a follow-up on the balance side. I know it depends on client behavior, but apart from that are you assuming any growth from the current earning assets of $200 billion in your guidance for 2016?","Mike Bell","Luke we anticipate a small decline in the average earning assets over the course of the full year but I think the more important point is the point that you've just made, which is, in large part it will be a function of market interest rates and just overall market conditions. But our feeling is that if the Fed funds rate increases by an additional 50 basis points, if Bank of England increases by an additional 50 basis points, that a good chunk of those excess deposits that are remaining will naturally come off the balance sheet and we do expect growth in our core business. So we would expect some growth in the operational deposits from growth in our core business. But I would say net-net I would expect that the average earning assets to be modestly less by year end 2016. Now importantly if there is a crisis again God forbid, all bets are off, I mean we're on a safe haven in terms of crisis so hopefully that's not going to happen, but that would be another wildcard.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo","Hi, I wanted to understand your guidance a little bit more. So your target had been to grow fee revenues to expenses by 200 basis points, last year it came in at 79 basis point and now your target is simply I guess 1 basis point, right, just 1 positive operating leverage. So on the one hand you were disappointed that you didn't meet the target last year, on the other hand the new target is basically just positive operating leverage. So I just want to reconcile those thoughts of being disappointed but then again lowering the target quite a bit and I think I've heard the reason the lower stock market, lower rates in Europe, currencies and regulatory costs, but rather hear you validate that or you elaborate on it?","Mike Bell","Sure, Mike, it's Mike. I'll start and if Jay wants to add. I mean importantly Mike we want to get every dollar of positive fee operating leverage that we can in 2016 and we're committed as we talked about to aggressively managing expenses to work towards achieving that goal. But it's the point that you've made. I mean with equity markets off almost 10% and we're not even through January yet, it just seemed to us to be irresponsible to put a specific number out there even in light of how confident we feel in Beacon. So again as I said to a couple of the earlier questions, I mean sure this is something that we'll talk about through the course of the year, but it's not a question of lowering our expectations. It's being cognizant of the environment and focusing aggressively on what we can control.","Mike Mayo","And as far as the actual expense guidance with project Beacon, last year, your core expenses were $7.520 billion and so for this year should we simply subtract $75 million, since that's the net number or that doesn\u2019t reflect the additional expense pressures?","Mike Bell","Well, it doesn't reflect for example expenses that I would expect to bring on to service the new business that we're winning out in the markets. So that's why I wouldn't stay away from just a raw expense number and it's going to largely depend upon our fee revenue growth. Since we're in the service business, we tend to need to bring on servicing capabilities to service new revenue. As I mentioned earlier as well the regulatory related expenses will likely increase, we don't think it will increase as much as they did in 2015. But that's why really Mike we're focused on fee operating leverage, positive fee operating leverage as being the overall goal, recognizing that the equity markets in January really make that a challenging objective.","Mike Mayo","And then lastly, the way you look at it, what was your pretax margin for 2015 especially since you\u2019re looking to take that quite a bit higher?","Mike Bell","29.1%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty with Bank of America.","Adam Beatty","I wanted to ask about the NIR guidance and in particular you\u2019ve been asked about some assumptions. You\u2019ve noted in your presentation the impact of foreign exchange on NIR. So I was just wondering, what is kind of your base case for the NIR scenarios was in terms of currency flat from here or something different from that? And then maybe how sensitive that number would be to currency?","Mike Bell","So in terms of the NIR ranges that we provided, it essentially assumes today\u2019s foreign exchange currency rates. Now again we recognize that that's a wildcard and as an example if we look at full year 2015 versus full year 2014, we estimate that NIR was negatively impacted by $54 million as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar over the course of 2015. So, obviously I don\u2019t expect that the U.S. dollar will strengthen further, at least at that kind of magnitude that we saw in 2015 but that would give you at least a sense of the magnitude if we had a repeat of that level of strengthening, that\u2019s the ballpark that we can see as a additional headwind in NIR. Obviously if the euro turns around and it got stronger in particular that would be helpful.","Adam Beatty","So the portfolio hasn\u2019t been repositioned such that the currency effect will be drastically different?","Mike Bell","That\u2019s correct.","Adam Beatty","And then turning to the new business wins in asset servicing, you mentioned the positive mix shift in asset management despite the negative flows over the positive revenue impact. So I was just wondering about asset servicing and the new wins, how that mix is shaping up? And also in terms of implementation, how soon you would expect the current backlog to be installed? Thanks.","Jay Hooley","Sure Adam let me take that. So I mentioned $300 billion-ish of new commitments on the asset servicing side, a little bit unusual, that was [tilted] to the U.S. with $250 billion of the $300 billion being U.S. and then I think you had $35 billion and $15 billion in EMEA and Asia Pacific. So to me it's a little bit indicative of some of the pressure that the asset management industry is under, now that it's not global but it's probably a little bit more acute in the U.S. And so the opportunity to do more deeper level of outsourcing as well as consolidate more activities with State Street is probably the underlying theme there. You also asked about the backlog, which again is a little bit higher at $380 billion and I think that\u2019s probably historically been in the $200 billion to $300 billion range. It\u2019s elevated because there is some bigger chunkier deals that had a little longer implementation time line. Those should layer in the first couple of quarters of 2016. Additionally, I would say from an outlook pipeline standpoint actually quite good with some different color from the U.S. to the Europe to Asia. Asia continues to be moving in a pretty positive line. Europe is again dominated by the offshore markets which is where the asset is coming from. And I\u2019d say the U.S. it's a combination of hedge and as I mentioned earlier the traditional loan-only managers, who are really grappling with fee pressure and flows and [where] an opportunity for them to streamline their operations and get more efficient.","Adam Beatty","That\u2019s great color. Am I right in assuming the asset management outsourcing is relatively high fee versus the current mix or not so much?","Jay Hooley","Asset management outsourcing broadly would be very consistent with the existing business from a fee and margin standpoint if I heard your question right.","Adam Beatty","Yes, I think you did. Thank you, Jay, appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Just a quick follow-up first on the Beacon question and the $75 million. Sorry to come back to it. I just want to make sure I understand. You expected it to be in number but you also talked about growing regulatory expenses albeit at a selling rate. So does that $75 million net reflect what your expectations on the regulatory front or is that regulatory headwind albeit at a declining rate a separate issue and if so can you help us frame the regulatory headwind by letting us know how much -- what the growth rate was full year '15 versus '14?","Mike Bell","Sure. Brennan this is Mike. First it's the latter. The regulatory expenses -- regulatory related expenses we look at them as a separate category from Beacon, so I do expect that some piece, although certainly not all of it or anything, but some piece of the Beacon savings would be offset by the additional growth in regulatory related expenses that we expect for 2016. And as we have talked about in the past Brennan I am really reluctant to try to give a very specific number on regulatory related expenses. I just think that at this point it's truly embedded in the enterprise. I mean we're all spending more time and attention on regulatory related issues and I just think that I mean it would take this sort of massive time and motion kind of study to give you a number that would accurately portray it. I mean it's fair to say there is significant upward pressure although as I said it's certainly fair to say that we still expect the bulk of the $75 million of the Beacon savings to drop to the bottom line. Again all the things equal the conversations that we had earlier.","Adam Beatty","Sure and I get that it's a tough one to try to frame and then we're in unchartered waters, just figured I'd give it a shot. Second question is on the asset management business. So just curious if you could help us think about the ETF flows. You had a good December which certainly helped out on the quarter, but seems like outflows were a little bit of a struggle on the ETF front for the SPDR's platform in 2015. So obviously you guys are working to try to launch new products as an offset there, but can you give us maybe broadly and strategically whether or not you think that's sufficient? Is it all just Vanguard and Price competition and given how the legacy or the previous SPDR's platform was positioned, you're more subject to that type of competition which is why you're going in the new direction? And how should we think about seasonal outflows which is it the other side of just the seasonal inflows in December, any color you could give us on that front just to help us model for this quarter would be great? Thanks a lot.","Jay Hooley","Great Brian, I am happy to pick that one up. Let me give you some numbers and then maybe I'll get to some more of your qualitative questions as to where we're on a journey to make ETF more important business for us. If I look at full year 2015, our net outflows were approximately $23 billion, our net outflows of the SPY which is the S&P 500 was outflows of $31 billion. So if you take the influence of the S&P 500 out of the mix, we would net up [$80 billion] and we would net up $11 billion in the fourth quarter. So there is a -- if you look at trends and you normalize for the S&P 500 which is a very large fund with fairly low fees that move a lot because people use it for liquidity purposes all over the globe. Right in that we have -- we've been on a two year journey to invest in our ETF platform in really two directions. One is that, initially our ETF orientation was more to the institutional market. We've ramped up considerably our intermediary sales force over the last couple of years. And the other place that we focused is on product. And our focus on product which really gets at maybe the heart of one of your questions has been away from the more commoditized type product and more towards the higher revenue yielding products. And so you saw some evidence in my quote, in 2015, we had five of the top U.S. new products in the marketplace and in fact we had 37% of the flows into new U.S. ETFs came to SSGA in 2015. So to me very good evidence that our strategy of not only building up our distribution sales force but reorienting our product towards the higher yielding products. I also referenced the smart beta theme which you tend to read about a lot, lately we think that's a big deal which is to take ETFs and bundle them in an asset allocation model and package them and sell them through largely intermediary market. We introduced three new smart beta ETFs to our model portfolios, there's another name given to that in the fourth quarter. And then the final point I would make, next to final point is that, we continue to be the only of the large players that are willing to open our platform to outside strategies. So the most recent would be the DoubleLine Fund which generated -- which is the largest new fund launch in the U.S. in 2015 at $1.8 billion. So I think we're doing all the things, we're executing on all the things that we set out to execute, and I think we're in a good track to make ETF not only a growth engine within SSGA but a bigger product overall State Street. So we are pleased with the progress.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","One quick follow-up on expenses, just so I fully understand what you're saying. If fee revenue is flat or down, can you have expenses down or is there a presumption of fee income growth despite the equity market decline so far?","Mike Bell","Jim, it's Mike. First of all obviously given the uncertainty around the environment it's difficult to answer your question definitively with full confidence. But I stand by what we talked about earlier, which is we do expect to manage expenses at a lower rate above growth in the revenue. At this point, I do expect that as long as markets reasonably cooperated we would still end up with full year net fee revenue growth. But again as we talked about earlier, it's something that we\u2019ll probably need to continue to update you on over the course of the year. But our expectation is to manage expenses aggressively and to manage those to a lower growth rate than the fee revenue.","Jim Mitchell","And just maybe on your NIR guidance with two rate hikes, the low end is actually lower than the high end of your additional rate hikes. It seems pretty modest impact from two rate hikes despite the 10-Q disclosure. So is that a change in deposit outflow assumptions or is it just timing in terms of the remaining six months of the year versus the full 12 months and beyond? How should we think about your NIR leverage given your 10-Q disclosures which are much more significant?","Mike Bell","Sure Jim. First of all, the 10-Q disclosures importantly, number one, assume no client behavior change. And we do anticipate with a couple of more hikes for excess deposits in particular to come off the balance sheet. Second, importantly the 10-Q disclosures are for a consistent interest rate change globally. And I would tell you that that is in my view highly unlikely to be the case in Europe. The ECB now has cut rates to minus 30, there is talk about cutting that further. As I mentioned earlier the credit spread compression that we\u2019ve seen in Europe because of their quantitative easing program has been significant. So I mean just to give you perhaps a number to help with the modeling, we estimate that on an all in basis this year versus full year 2015 that the euro NIR is expected to decline by approximately $40 million year-over-year and that\u2019s assuming the interest rates in Europe where they sit today, just not factor in fully additional deterioration. So, it is the case that we would expect things to be stronger in the U.S. but that\u2019s a headwind. And again relative to full year 2015, the decline in the excess deposits would also be a headwind to NIR; on the other hand, obviously still very positive versus having the issue of the prefs to pay for those.","Jim Mitchell","And then last question from me, about securities lending, you saw short term spreads widen quite a bit in the fourth quarter that seems to be continuing so far. Was most that impact already felt in 4Q or should we see some further benefits to wider spreads if they stay where they are in 1Q on the sec lending side?","Mike Bell","Jim it's obviously a little bit early to give you definitive guidance on sec lending for the first half of the year. I would say that we feel very positive about the uptick in sec lending. In Q4 specifically we saw an increase in the average assets on loan, both fully enhanced custody business as well as the Agency business. We saw higher spreads particularly on U.S. equities and believe that the demand for short interest and in particular for specials in Q4 helped significantly. I wouldn\u2019t at this point -- I mean I see nothing to believe that that is going to come down. On the other hand, I wouldn\u2019t try to project additional growth since Q4 was as strong as it was.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you for taking the question. I\u2019ve got a question on the senior secured bank loan book. Do you know where that would be if you look to sit on a mark to market basis rather than an accrual accounts end basis?","Mike Bell","Sure Geoff it's Mike. I don\u2019t have the very specific number off the top of my head, because we have been tight in terms of our credit underwriting and also have been investing in the upper end of the credit scale for those leverage loans, it would be closer to par than the overall market. It\u2019s at a slight discount but I want to say round numbers about $0.98 on the $1.","Geoffrey Elliott","And what\u2019s the energy component within that portfolio?","Mike Bell","It's relatively small. It's approximately $55 million of the $3.3 billion in the overall portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard Cassidy","Jay can you share with us, you mentioned about the new program Beacon as a step two and you needed to take step one of course to get to step two. Is there going to be a step three, is this an involving process? I know this goes up to 2020, which is a ways away, but when you look out longer term is this just an ongoing fact of this business that you've got constantly have these big programs?","Jay Hooley","I would say largely, Gerard, I would view this being a two stage event. Stage one complete, stage two just commenced. There will always be opportunities to apply technology to this business both to generate revenue opportunities and expense saves. But in my vision there's Beacon. Since we have gone through the staging of standardization, centers of excellence, rewriting a lot of the applications, I think once we wired them together and for me the Holy Grail is to create an environment within State Street that's all real-time. And if it's all real-time, you have minimal human intervention, you have all the attendant benefits of it and in my mind as we get out to 2020 we should largely be there. Not that there won't be -- I'd say if there was a stage three it would be more revenue oriented. Once we can create a real-time infrastructure, we have the opportunity to build systems and build capabilities to generate global exchange type opportunities is probably where the next big move is. But again it's not cost oriented it's more how you take the data on analytics that are created in this Beacon environment and create information based services to our customers that would be obviously chargeable.","Gerard Cassidy","Now is the technology that you're anticipating to get this going, is it all available now or are you anticipating there will be even more advances in technology three years from now that will make deposits even better for the customers?","Jay Hooley","That's a great question and I would say we have a plan with a lot of detail around it, but I would fully expect that as we get out in years that technology advances will cause us to make adjustments to the plan. And I'll just give you an example Gerard that hopefully will resonate. When we went into the ITOT as we call it, we were very determined that we wanted to create a cloud environment and we're also very convinced that the only cloud environment that was appropriate would be a private cloud that we would own and operate and control it. I think today it's quite a bit different. We would envision that some of that the test modules that we would build, we might run around a public could. That as long as you encrypt the data you are as safe running it out in the public cloud as you're in a private cloud. And I'd say, if you talk to people that are deeply involved in this world, you would find that to be a fairly meaningful shift in philosophy. So within our Beacon plans some of that is bled-in, but I think for us to imagine what the technology enablements will be five years out is pretty tough to do. I think though it's back to a point that I made and you reinforced which is, unfortunately you can't leap frog. So you have to modify along the way and we think we've got a plan that not only enables us to get to that future real state, but it will also allow us to take advantage of advances in technology as they unfold over the next five years.","Gerard Cassidy","Great and then as a second question, coming to you again Jay, you've mentioned that the assets under management this year, a large client was going to take out $35 billion I think you said. Couple of questions, one, why is the client leaving? And two, $35 billion is that a real big customer, medium-sized customer, small customer, how would you characterize that type of client?","Jay Hooley","Sure, so I would say it's a customer where we have a long-term multidimensional relationship, this is just one component of it. I would characterize it as a smallest kind of customer and I say that because it's all passive assets. So it' a little bit my SPDR S&P 500 example where the headline number is big but the revenues associated with it are not all that, not significant. The other point I would make Gerard is that, well not a trend, it's not exceptional that somebody would say, I want to run my passive assets myself and this particular customer was a bank decided that as opposed to outsourcing that to us they would in-source it to themselves.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hi, just a quick question. On the expense billing program, are the costs associated with that billing error I guess it is? You said you had a $223 million pretax liability associated with that. I was just curious as to why that didn't hit the P&L and is that excluded from your operating guidance when it is expected at P&L, I guess sometime this year?","Mike Bell","Brian, it's Mike. First this does relate to overbilling that we have had historically, in fact it goes back to the late 1990s. So as a result rather than charging the Q4 2015 P&L with that amount we have revised the other financial statements that we provided this quarter to basically make an adjustment to the most recent P&L periods and also to the retained earnings account for year-end '14. So this is reflected in that retained earnings statement, so it's already negatively impacted our capital, that piece for the liabilities that I talked about in the prepared remarks, that is behind us at this point. Now, obviously, as you can imagine, other things can develop, but at this point, that\u2019s already reflected in the balance sheet and in prior earnings periods.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And then just on the operating leverage guidance, so if we\u2019re assuming taking your 10% decline in equity markets, there is 2% decline in revenues, just kind of putting that through the year-to-date numbers, I mean a 7% decline in the equity market thus far equates about 1.4% of decline in the revenues. So given that the $75 million reduction in expenses that you\u2019re expecting to hit is just about 1% of your operating expenses, where also that $75 million of expenses come from to get you to positive operating leverage assuming no further change in equity markets to year end?","Mike Bell","Importantly Brian we\u2019re looking number one, at expenses across the board. So I do expect that we\u2019ll find additional expense opportunities beyond what is part of project Beacon. Second, you\u2019re assuming that there is no other fee revenue growth over the course of 2016 in your comments. And I would anticipate that between net new business and potential growth in for example global markets revenue that we would still be able to get there. But again it's something that\u2019s an evolving situation since the market environment is as challenging as it is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","I wanted to focus on the net interest income, which if you look at the last year, you were down 13%, if you adjust for currencies down 11%. That\u2019s really the major source of underperformance relative to the other trust banks that were both up around 8%. So, their ability to add duration on their side, or benefit from rather upticks you get in that fund rate is kind of swamping what you\u2019re having to deal with. Catalysts that you see balancing restructuring or maybe more focus in Europe, how do those catalysts begin to wane and when do you get back on track to be in line with the other peers?","Mike Bell","So Marty it's Mike. First, I am really reluctant to try to give you specific comparisons to our various benchmark competitors. Our business mix is very different. As you correctly pointed out we\u2019ve tended to have more impact from changes in Europe than our competitors over the long-term. I think that served us well. But in the near-term that\u2019s a pressure point. We have different portfolios. We have different mixes of business that those portfolios back. So again I would hesitate to try to give you a very specific comparison because I don\u2019t know specifically how they\u2019re managing their balance sheet. What I can tell you is how we\u2019re managing our balance sheet and in terms of the catalyst, as we talked about, we do expect that the recent increase in the Fed funds rate to be particularly helpful. That for example, even though it's just for the U.S. dollars, it does mean that the floating rate assets that we have that are dollar denominated have been resetting over the course of the last three months and that\u2019s been helpful in terms of the near-term NIR outlook. If we do get additional Fed fund increases, again we expect that to do a couple of things for us. Number one, we do expect that to be accretive to NIR, because while we will share in all likelihood some of that with clients, we do typically share a percentage for example of the Overnight Index and would retain a portion of that for ourselves. And then just longer term it's helpful to have these increases in interest rates, because Marty, one of the big things that weighed on us in 2015 is the grind in the fixed rate portion of the portfolio. About two-thirds of the portfolio is fixed rate and that\u2019s been rolling over, the yield on the maturing assets has been quite a bit higher in ballpark like 75 basis points higher than the fixed rate yield of new purchases. So if interest rates particularly in that call it three year, five year, 10 year kind of zone, would increase consistently where the Fed fund rate may increase that would be helpful in terms of reducing that grind. And then maybe lastly, you mentioned it and I am just repeating it. If conditions got better in Europe either in terms of getting the ECB rate back closer to positive territory and ideally some credit spread widening that would be very helpful as well.","Marty Mosby","And just another question, if you look at the emphasis you had on trying to push some of the marginal deposits out of the balance sheet, have you seen any implication to customer relationships because of that? Fee income seems to be doing relatively well, market share holding in there. But just was interested that efforts you're doing to try to overcome your emphasis on that side.","Jay Hooley","Yes, Marty, let me take that, this is Jay. I would say broadly no. I think that -- what I think we did well is we got way out in front of this. So that was really the beginning of 2015 where we began to have a series of conversations with our customers and there was a shorter percentage of customers who are holding the lion's share of the excess deposits which made it helpful. But we worked with customers over the course of six months to make sure, one, they understood the issue and our pressure point, and two, begin the layer in a set of fees to hold excess deposits on our balance sheet. And so we gave customers enough lead time in order to manage the situation or pay the freight to hold excess deposits on our balance sheet. So I think the nature of the way we went about it and also I think the other thing that's probably safe to say is that, we are probably out front on this. I think everybody else is catching up. So I think this conversation about excess deposits is not unique to State Street anymore, but I think we executed the plan pretty well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Just a clarification Mike on the timing of the run rate for expenses the $75 million and the $125 million for 2016 and 2017 respectively, is that a 4Q '16 and 4Q '17 annualized run rate or rather a full year which should imply higher 4Q run rate?","Mike Bell","Brian, this is a full year comparison, so the $75 million is full year '16 versus full year '15 and importantly is a net number to operating expenses. So for example we're going to have some IT spending and just overall programs spending in Q1 and that will continue throughout the year. The $75 million is the gross savings minus the investment spending that I just mentioned. Importantly, it doesn't include any potential restructuring charges. I would suspect that a portion of that $300 million to $400 million of overall expected restructuring charges over the period 2016 to 2020 some of that may impact 2016, that would not be included in the $75 million.","Brian Bedell","Right, okay, so then just to imply that as you work through the quarters and we get to the fourth quarter the run rates will be higher than the full year run rate moving into next years?","Mike Bell","Yes, that's likely fair. I think the only reason I hesitate a little bit is that the investment spending, particularly the IT spending is somewhat of a fluid situation. So again we will be focused on the net. But I think your modeling assumption is a fair one.","Brian Bedell","Okay great. Just lastly one the FX trading, I know the direct sales component of the FX declined much more than the indirect. I guess Jay, is there anything FX product with that other aside from the lower market volatility and would you expect that given what we know about FX volatility in client volumes, do you expect that to rebound in 1Q on that part of it?","Jay Hooley","I would say, Brian, it's feels to me more episodic than anything that is a trend line and I think that our volumes were pretty much in line with what we saw in the industry, volatility hung in as now I would view it more of an episodic.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions in queue.","Jay Hooley","Thank you for your time and attention this morning and look forward to hopefully seeing all of you in New York on February 24th. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

On our call today, our CEO Ron O\u2019Hanley, will speak first; then Eric Aboaf, our CFO will take you through our first quarter 2019 earnings slide presentation which is available for download in the Investor Relations' section of our website investors.statestreet.com.

Turning to slide 3, you will see we announced our first quarter financial results this morning. Our results reflect challenging industry conditions including lower average equity market levels relative to 1Q 2018, continued pricing pressure, and lower global industry flows that were somewhat improved from 4Q 2018 but muted compared to the last few years.","In light of the current environment, we are driving a culture of execution and productivity as evidenced by the early accomplishments of our expense management program, which I will discuss further shortly.","Assets under custody and administration increased 3% relative to the end of fourth quarter of 2018 to $32.6 trillion with new wins in the quarter of $120 billion and assets yet to be installed of $309 billion.","At Global Advisors assets under management increased by 12% relative to the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 to $2.8 trillion supported by higher period end equity market values and net new inflows of over $70 billion.","Turning to slide 4 and before diving a bit deeper on the quarter, I would remind you that our vision is to be the leading asset servicer, asset manager, and data insight provider to the owners and managers of the world's capital. Let me provide a check-in on the progress against the strategic execution priorities underlying this vision which you have heard me outline previously.","These priorities are; first, to reignite our servicing fee growth; second, to innovate and grow diversified revenue streams; third, to deploy the industry's leading front-to-back asset servicing platform as a technology-driven scale provider; fourth, to generate substantial expense saves; and fifth, to foster a high-performing and leaner organization focused on execution and productivity.","We recognize that industry servicing fee revenue remains under pressure. However, we are taking a multipronged approach to reigniting servicing fee growth and are confident in our ability to grow revenue which we expect to see in a few quarters.","Let me mention some of the actions we have underway. First, we are significantly upgrading our client coverage model. Our new client executive program is approximately two-thirds of the way complete led by a combination of new talent and accountable executives. It will deliver a cohesive one State Street experience to our most important clients, which account for more than 50% of our revenue.","Second, we have established a new executive deal review committee. This group is evaluating client pricing and business acceptance decisions that have firm-wide applications.","And third, we are strategically aligning the company with the most attractive plant segments in the market our fastest-growing large clients, which include global asset managers, asset owners, and insurance firms.","We are changing the way we interact with clients renewing our focus on delivering industry-leading client service and innovative new offerings, while driving efficiencies for State Street.","In keeping with this proactive approach, I personally have been working with our client service teams to review client account plans and have met with close to 40 client CEOs in my first 90 days as CEO of State Street.","Beyond our largest clients, we are capitalizing on our learnings and have plans in place to implement new segment strategies over the next few quarters beginning with the insurance and asset owner segments with the aim of increasing market and wallet share and further diversifying our revenue stream.","Next, I would like to concentrate on our priority to deploy the industry's leading front-to-back asset servicing platform. We are already making measurable progress. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately 110 opportunities being actively pursued by our sales teams.","Notably, we anticipate announcing a number of client adoptions of the front-to-back platform during 2019 as clients see the strong value proposition enabled by the Charles River State Street combination.","We are pleased with the momentum of Charles River's front end offering as evidenced by its strong new bookings and remain confident in achieving our revenue and cost synergy projections announced when we acquired the business last year.","Moving on I'd like to discuss our current expense management initiatives. We remain committed to generating expense saves over the medium-term while continuing to invest prudently in our business. Given the challenging operating environment, this past January, we announced an even more ambitious $350 million cost program for 2019 targeting 4% productivity savings driven by resource discipline as well as process reengineering and automation before investing a portion of that in technology including resilience and growth initiatives. To-date, we have already achieved more than 20% of the targeted savings.","Disciplined expense management continues to be one of my top priorities. The firm-wide hiring freeze for all non-critical roles outside of CRD that I implemented remains in place. We are now reducing our workforce while structurally compressing the senior management pyramid. These measures have contributed to an overall reduction in underlying expenses by 2% relative to the fourth quarter of 2018.","Finally, becoming a higher performing organization is the cornerstone to executing on our vision and successfully achieving our strategic priorities. I am deeply focused on simplifying the organization and ensuring we have the right leadership in order to drive our strategy and achieve results across State Street.","To that end I have made a number of changes to our senior management team. Since last December, we have in place a new Chief Operating Officer, a new Head of Global Delivery, a new Head of our Global Clients divisions, as well as a new Head of Global Markets.","We also have announced that Francisco Aristeguieta will join State Street and become the CEO for our International business. Francisco is a highly experienced and talented individual who will lead all of our international business activities. These new leaders will drive the change we desire and ensure we have a high probability of executing on our strategic priorities but that will take some time.","I'd like to conclude my remarks by highlighting our focus on capital return to our shareholders. During the first quarter, we returned approximately $480 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As we look ahead, we feel that the current repositioning of our balance sheet during 2018 positions us well for CCAR 2019. We remain optimistic that we can achieve a total payout that is substantially better than 80% for this CCAR cycle.","And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.","Eric Aboaf","Thank you, Ron and good morning everyone. Before I begin my review of our first quarter 2019 result, I'd like to take a moment on slide five to discuss certain notable items this quarter and how they impacted our financials.","On page five we show our GAAP results in the top left panel, as well as certain results ex to notable items on the bottom left panel for those of you who want to see some of the underlying trends.","For 1Q 2019, we recognize a total of $23 million pre-tax and notable items or $0.06 a share, consisting of $9 million of net acquisition and restructuring costs related to Charles River and $14 million of legal and related items.","On a period-on-period -- for period-on-period comparisons, recall that we had no notables in 1Q 2018, but did have $321 million pre-tax of notable items equal to $0.64 per share in 4Q 2018.","Turning to slide six. We saw a period end AUC\/A levels decline 2% year-on-year and increased 3% quarter-on-quarter. AUM levels increased 3% year-on-year and increased 12% quarter-on-quarter. Much of these sequential quarter changes were driven by large double-digit upswings in the end of period global equity markets, which recovered during the first quarter, after closing down sharply in 4Q.","Let me remind you, however, that our servicing and management fee revenues are more closely related to daily average market levels. On this basis, global equity markets were down year-on-year and up only slightly quarter-on-quarter. And while we saw a rebound in equity markets recently, the continued economic and market uncertainty has led to lower levels of industry flows and client activity resulting in further headwinds in Q1.","Moving to slide seven. Servicing fees were down 12% year-on-year or 10% ex-FX and 3% quarter-on-quarter. During the last year we saw challenging industry conditions persist, as we continue to see the ongoing impact of fee concessions, previously announced client transition, as well as lower client flows and activity and lower global equity markets.","We are now executing on a number of initiatives to counterbalance these industry conditions, which we spoke about in February and continue to expand upon. More specifically, we are, number one, rolling out our new client coverage model across a targeted client base. We're focusing on increasing share of wallet given our estimated 35% starting point.","Number two, leveraging our CRD client dialogues to drive incremental core servicing fee revenues, something I'll discuss later in my remarks. Number three, concentrating on key market segments like insurance and asset owners where we have a particularly strong proposition to build upon.","And number four, realizing the benefits of increasing pricing discipline from our newly formed executive deal review committee, which met five times in Q1 and is currently reviewing approximately 30 transactions.","This adds a very senior perspective to our client relationships that has introduced new found pricing rigor, as well as more senior client share of wallet discussions. Given the sales and negotiation cycle, it will take a few quarters until we see these initiatives come through in the P&L.","Turning to slide eight. Let me discuss the rest of fee revenues, beginning with management fees. 1Q revenue was down 11% year-on-year, driven by weaker daily average global equity market levels, as well as late 4Q outflows and a product mix shift away from higher fee products. Fees were down 5% quarter-on-quarter, half of which was day count. After a tough December sell off, we saw only a slight sequential lift from the 1% quarter-on-quarter uptake in daily average equity prices.","Our asset management business did however see over $70 billion of positive net flows this quarter in the institutional index space and a very nice rebound in cash, which gives us some confidence going into 2Q.","FX trading was down 8% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter on lower client volumes and lower-than-average market volatility. Securities finance revenues were down 16% year-on-year, largely reflecting the CCAR related balance sheet repositioning in the second half of 2018 and flattish quarter-on-quarter, as we saw monthly assets and loans dip in December and January and then rebound nicely as clients re-leveraged and new business came in. This bodes well for 2Q.","Finally, processing fees and other was up year-on-year, reflecting roughly a $95 million revenue contribution from CRD this quarter, as well as a tax advantaged lease sale and market related adjustments in our asset management employee long-term incentive plan.","Moving to slide nine. I wanted to spend some more time talking about CRD, its financial performance and how we're advancing our front-to-back strategy. As you'll see in the top left panel, CRD had another strong quarter in Q1, generating $99 million of revenues on $41 million of operating expenses, resulting in $58 million of pre-tax income.","The business also saw $6 million in new client bookings during the quarter. While CRD continues to perform well, I would caution against simply annualizing these 1Q results, given the lumpiness inherent in the 606 revenue accounting reporting standard.","We've also achieved some important milestones this quarter, which we've listed below. These are indicators of success that we've been looking for and we expect more to come.","Turning to the upper right panel on this page, we wanted to provide you an update on our active client discussions regarding CRD. As you can see here, our client discussions continue to advance. We're now actively engaging with approximately 110 clients who represent approximately $39 trillion in assets.","As we engage, we're finding that some clients are looking for a full front-to-back offering, so that they can benefit by streamlining numerous portfolio management risk, training and compliance systems in their front office and multiple middle and back office systems into one consolidated State Street platform.","At the same time, other clients are excited about our powerful interoperable solutions where we actively build automated interface within feeds from our custodial system into leading front office software providers, like Aladdin and Bloomberg. We are committed to both approaches. ","As anticipated, these client dialogues are resulting in a variety of revenue opportunities and we remain confident in our revenue and cost synergy goals announced at the time of the acquisition.","Turning to slide 10. NII was up 5% year-on-year, while NIM expanded 14 basis points over the same period, both driven by higher U.S. interest rates and disciplined deposit pricing. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, however, and consistent with our expectations, we saw NII decline by 3% and NIM tightened one basis point, as a result of lower client deposits and two fewer days in the quarter.","Unpacking our client deposit behavior this quarter, I would note that average total deposits have gently trended lower as our asset manager and asset owner clients are being more discerning.","At the same time, we have seen some lumpiness in non-interest bearing balances, which had actually ticked up in 4Q and backed down in 1Q and are now back on their normal multi-year trend line. And as expected, we also saw an upward move in total interest-bearing deposit betas, but the move was consistent with our expectations of steady client behavior, as well as some targeted wholesale deposit gathering initiatives that we consciously initiated. We do have a series of deposit initiatives in flight that should yield growth in the latter half of the year.","Now turning to expenses on slide 11. As you're well aware we are extraordinarily focused on managing expenses in this challenging revenue environment and launched a new expense savings program last quarter, designed to generate material and measurable efficiency and productivity gains over the course of this year.","I'll start by summarizing our expenses this quarter ex-notables and seasonal expenses so that underlying trends are more readily visible. Year-on-year, our underlying expenses were up 1%, but actually down 2%, excluding CRD. You see that this was a result of a hard work across almost every line of the expense base, comp and benefits, transaction processing, occupancy and other. And on a quarter-on-quarter basis, underlying expenses were down nearly 2%.","We have bent the cost curve by; number one, implementing a hiring freeze, which has reduced high cost location headcount by 800 in the first quarter, which is 2.5 times the off-boarding rate of 2018; number two, we're almost halfway through the 15% reduction in senior executives; and number three, we've continued to adjust incentive compensation.","Now turning to slide 12, you can see how these forceful actions have resulted in a quick start to the 2019 expense savings program. As a reminder, in January we announced an ambitious $350 million expense savings target for this fiscal year, which is more than 4% of our expense base. This includes $160 million that come from resource discipline with the remaining $190 million that come from process reengineering. And we're off to a strong start already achieving approximately $78 million of expense savings, which gives us confidence on delivering the full target amount this year.","The resource discipline savings achieved have come primarily from senior management delayering and third-party vendor saves while the process engineering and automation benefits have enabled the reduction in our high-cost location headcount and the ongoing shift to our global hubs.","These initiatives yielded a reduction in your company-wide headcount this quarter by approximately 0.5 percentage point, evidenced by the trend chart on the bottom of this page.","With this $350 million expense savings program, we can fully fund technology infrastructure and important business growth investments while still delivering a 1% reduction in the total underlying expenses for the year.","Moving to slide 13, our capital ratios were relatively consistent quarter-on-quarter with our standardized CET1 at 11.5% and our tier 1 leverage at 7.4%. We resumed common stock repurchases during the first quarter, returning a total of approximately $480 million of capital to shareholders, $300 million of which were share buybacks.","As you can see on the left side of the page with the rebalancing of our investment portfolio completed during 4Q 2018, we have continued to increase fixed rate asset so as to limit earnings sensitivity from the downtick in rates.","And with these balance sheet and other actions, we believe we are well-positioned for the 2019 CCAR process and are confident we can deliver a total payout ratio substantially above 80% subject to the usual regulatory approvals.","Lastly based on recent regularly filings we now anticipate that our 2020 GCIB surcharge will fall from 1.5% to 1%, a development that should provide us with incremental capital management flexibility going forward.","Before turning to slide 14, I'd like to cover our 2Q outlook. We expect fee revenues will be flat to up 1% on a sequential quarter basis. At a macro level, we are assuming equity markets consistent with margin levels, which should provide some support to servicing and management fees, net of quarterly pricing pressure and other drivers.","We also expect a seasonal uptick in our markets businesses, partially offset by the absence of 1Q gains in processing fees and other. But we also want to be cautious given the low market volatility we're seeing in April year-to-date.","In regards to NII for 2Q, we expect to see a decrease of 1% to 2% driven by continued modest rotation out of non-interest bearing deposits into interest bearing and yield curve expectations of lower long rates.","In terms of 2Q expenses, we currently expect to see underlying expenses flat to up less than 1% sequentially excluding notable items in first quarter seasonal and deferred comp but driven by merit increases and CRD expansion.","That said, we are firmly on track for a full year guidance of underlying expenses down 1%, and we will intervene further if necessary. Taxes should be the same range as this quarter though our full year guidance of 17% of 19% remains.","In summary on page 14, 1Q 2019 was a tough quarter as we work to restart fee growth and focus on productivity. The 2% sequential reduction of underlying expenses we achieved 1Q 2019 demonstrated, our ability to manage expenses and achieve the expected net 1% reduction in our underlying full year expenses that we announced earlier this year.","As Ron mentioned earlier, we continue to make progress on our strategic priorities. We have undertaken a number of new initiatives to help reignite servicing fee growth while expanding our sales efforts on the back per acquisition of CRD and making real progress on our synergies.","We're also seeing productivity saves come through the P&L, evidenced by the $78 million in savings, which is driving down expenses year-on-year across almost all line items and we brought headcount down sequentially.","Finally, we resume share repurchase in the first quarter and returned approximately $480 million of capital to shareholders. Given the balance sheet repositioning undertaken this late last year, we're optimistic subject to the usual Federal Reserve approvals that we can deliver a total payout substantially above 80% for the upcoming CCAR cycle.","And with that, let me hand the call back over to Ron.","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Thank you, Eric. Questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] You first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hi, good morning everybody. Ron first question for you. I guess, I was hoping to a little bit of a bigger picture. But I was hoping you could compare the fully integrated front-to-back offering of CRD with State Street with your guidance middle and back-office solutions against some of the other platforms. Obviously you guys mentioned Aladdin and Bloomberg. Help us think through the positives and negatives clients need to consider between vertically integrated model of State Street with CRD versus something that's a little bit more open architecture with Aladdin and Bloomberg?","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Thanks, Alex. It's a big question there. Firstly, let me start with your premise in that I don't think it's in either or as we've I think talked about from the beginning, we strongly believe in the need for a front-to-back solution. It's what our clients are demanding as they're trying to deal with the complexity that's built up in their operations and their own cost. They are looking for simplification, which really does drive some kind of a pre-trade to reporting type of solution, recognizing that we're the largest asset servicer for asset managers, and the fact that different clients will want different things and their selling points are different, we've been committed to both a front-to-back platform that as you said if desired by clients could be exclusively State Street products, but at the same time an interoperable and open architecture functioning of that platform driven by data.","So, we remain committed to interoperability but ultimately believe that over time what clients will need is something that truly is front-to-back. That it starts, for example, with a single security master file that you're not having to do all sorts of reconciliations along the way. And certainly there are offerings in place that start to get at that, but we do believe that over time that kind of a front-to-back is what will solve clients' issues.","Secondly, we are also thinking about this from our own perspective and our own strategic perspective in terms of as we think about where growth will come from and where revenue growth will come from. There's the existing pool of back and middle-office revenues and there's at least as large a pool if not larger of front-office revenues that become available to us to the extent, to which we connect -- we implement this front-to-back solution.","And by that, I'm not just talking about order management or risk analytics or those kinds of things but by having this seamless platform, it makes it much easier for example to trade FX, right. To decide what you're going to do in terms of securities lending. So it has benefits for lots of the high margins ancillary revenue offerings that we have.","So we step back from it. We're committed to both and the reason why we're committed to both is that the real competition here is not Charles River versus Aladdin or Bloomberg versus Charles River, it's really what most institutions have in place is this plethora of Excel spreadsheets propriety kinds of things a multiplicity of risk analytic tools and it's simplifying that in moving to something that's a more integrated platform.","Eric Aboaf","And Alex, it's Eric. I'd just add that from a revenue standpoint when we offer a front-to-back offering, right. We enter and participate in a whole new revenue pool, right. An $8 billion revenue pool in the front office that we can now secure, grow, expand and deliver on. When we offer for other clients who want an interoperable or open architecture system -- a custodian will plug into those front-office systems just like I said in my prepared remarks, whether it's with Aladdin or some of the other front-office providers in that case the custodian doesn't earn materially more in revenues, right.","Those revenues are already sitting there in the office system for the front-office provider. So from our perspective the real revenue growth opportunity is to participate on that vertically integrated front-to-back offering, but on the other hand we have clients who want and need that open and interoperable solution and we're delighted to provide that as part of how we work with them, plug-in with them, interface with them as part of what we do as a custodian.","Alex Blostein","Great. Thank you very much for that. And then the second question Eric for you, just on follow-up around some of the NIR comments you mentioned. So beyond Q2 guidance, I was hoping you can kind of give us some puts and takes as we think about 2019. I know you mentioned growth in deposits in the latter half of the year potentially yielding some positive results, but obviously the interest rate environment has gotten a little worse. So just maybe help us think through the rest of the year on NIR?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, I think, clearly since January the tone and the market indicators for interest rates has changed right? Back in January, we even thought there was a possibility of an interest rate hike. I think now we're at the front end of the curve now we're talking about the opposite. 10-year rates were in the 275-plus range and now are down 25 basis points, 30 basis points at least. So I think there's a different environment that we find ourselves in. And so as we look out at the year, we think we're going to see a downtick in 2Q. We said -- I said 1% to 2%. I think on a full year basis, we're looking to probably flattish on NII for the full year right?","And the way that'll come is that we're going to continue our active efforts to grow our balance sheet. So our investment portfolio will tick-up this quarter. We've got -- our lending business is going to continue to grow. We're going to fund that with some of the initiatives that we're driving on deposits and those together need to offset some of the underlying rotation that we and industry continues to see in deposits from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing. But, I think, we're optimistic we can kind of work through this period of interest rates, but it's clearly a bit different than what we expected at the turn of the year.","Alex Blostein","Great. Thanks for all the details on that both questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. First one is on AUC. So it was up, I think as you highlighted 3% quarter-over-quarter. But when we look at historical trends versus what we saw in the markets this quarter it suggested to me that the sequential change should have been higher and maybe even double that. So can you talk about whether or not there were some lost business in the custody side? And what exactly was happening there? It just seems like there was a pretty big dislocation especially versus AUM? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Brennan, it's Eric. This quarter we had decouple features working through on the -- on a quarter-on-quarter basis. As you describe the spot equity markets were up. Now remember, we've got a mix of equities, fixed income and alternative assets are not quite as much as say the S&P. We did have also the lingering, probably almost a final piece was on that previously announced transition that we announced last year. And then we had one other middle-office deal, which I'd kind of put in the legacy bucket that was done a long time ago. It was margin-neutral, which doesn't really pay from our standpoint that a client chose to in source and do themselves, and so that had an affect on the quarter end.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. And then when we think about expenses here, it seems as though the outlook for NII difficult servicing revenue challenging. You guys have laid out the plan to cut expenses and when we look at on a gross basis, it seems pretty solid, but then we're chipping away three quarters of it with reinvestment. So, I guess, my pushback here is to say why not -- what are the thresholds to justify that investment spend? Why not ratchet the bar higher from an IRR perspective for that investment? Why not for self-funding? Why not pick-up the pressure here to try to drive expense growth lower to try to bring down expenses more given how difficult the environment is because it certainly seems as though based on that -- on the AUC side -- and the servicing revenue piece there's just something that's underwhelming here on the revenue side and there -- it seems as though the best place to make up for it is expenses.","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Yes. Brennan, why don't I start and then Eric, I'm sure will add to it. Firstly, we need to be focused on both in our, but we do know that what we can control more easily is our expenses. So the programs that we announced at the beginning of January is actually an addition to a number of initiatives that we already have underway in terms of continuing to automate our business and continue to make sure the work is being done at the right place, by the right people, at the right time. And that in itself will continue to yield us some expense savings in addition to the program that we announced in early January.","In terms of the reinvestments there is a very high bar on this an extremely high bar. We're actually, I mean, if you -- as you do expect there's more demands than what we're willing to fund and what we're willing to fund needs to have a very high bar either in terms of it adds meaningfully to our client value proposition such that we can visibly see the potential for new revenues, lowers our costs, lowers our risk. Much of that reinvestment is in the resilience area which is a heavy focus now not just for ourselves, but for the regulators. So we hear you on this. We're continuing to keep that bar very high, but are also very confident that most if not all of those investments themselves will yield economic improvement for us. Eric?","Eric Aboaf","And Brennan, it's Eric. I would just add that we ask ourselves these questions every day right? Because we're trying to navigate through this uncertain environment and we're asking ourselves every day where can we push harder, faster, deeper. And that's part of the management process and that's why you saw us at the very end of the year announce a hiring freeze, take out 15% of the senior executive pyramid, adjust incentive comp, because we know we need to be decisive on some of these areas and will continue to be.","And if the -- if our expectations in the top line don't materialize, we're going to have to do more and we're going to have to figure out how and that's just part of, I think, our perspective. I think we do want to balance that there is some need to reinvest in areas like our technology infrastructure and continue to freshen it and make sure that it is second to none out there.","And if you think about it, our clients put a lot of stock in what we do and our reputation is our brand as one of the leading custodial -- custodians in the world. And so, we've got to be balanced as well as we think about our position.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks for the color. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, Eric, can I ask you to expand a little bit more on your outlook for fees to be flattish to plus 1% in the second quarter? I think you mentioned the -- obviously, the markets and averages have a really good start. We know about the business wins and we know about seasonality.","So can you talk about, I guess, especially the processing and other with the size of that tax gain and then how does CRD trend from here, in terms of just some of the other moving parts, that would only keep it flat to slightly up? I would think that you'd have a better chance of some better growth given the backdrop improvement?","Eric Aboaf","Yes. Ken, it's Eric. Let me try kind of in reverse order, because I think it'll help. On processing and other, we had, as I think I described, about 99 -- I'm sorry, $95 million of revenue, which was down from the fourth quarter which we had disclosed. So you can kind of do the comparison and that's just the \u2013 how revenue recognition comes in, in that business.","We also had two other factors this quarter. We had a small sale in our LIHTC portfolio. We have LIHTC, we have wind farm tax-advantaged investment, solar, et cetera. There was an opportunity to benefit from an appreciation that we choose to take and that was worth about $7, so maybe worth calling out.","I think the other piece that happened in the processing and other lines, it's also where we need to book the mark-to-market adjustments on the underlying trust that support our asset management business, management incentive pools, right?","Which are tied to the performance of their funds and that created a positive mark this quarter of just over $10 and a negative mark last quarter, right? Due to the fall in the equity markets of almost $15 million. And so, there is kind of this back and forth going on in processing and other, which we need to account for. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color and context on that line.","I think if I go back to the top of the fee schedule, markets will be what they will be in some ways and will be responsive as our clients engage with this. We do expect some seasonal uptick in areas like securities lending and I think we have some confidence there.","I think on servicing fees and management fees, we'll get a bit of an uptick from the average daily levels of the global equity markets to help. On the other hand, there is the kind of pricing pressure coming through. And then, I think, we continue to see a -- either a neutral our even a negative contribution for underlying flows and activity, just given the risk off sentiment, the low levels of volatility and those tend to go the other way. So anyway hopefully that's a bit of color as you think about second quarter.","Ken Usdin","Yes. And my follow-up on that last point, Eric, would just be, the commentary about flows and low sentiment and activity. Have you seen any change in the underlying? I know the ICI that you show in the press release looks better, but is it just still quiet out there? Or is there a change in just the underlying activity level of the client base in general? And how would you just characterize that? Thanks.","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Ken, this is Ron. Let me talk about that. I would say that there\u2019s been some improvement in client activity and flows since the fourth quarter, but its way below recent trend. And I think for somewhat obvious reasons, if you think about the amount of uncertainty out there, if you think about Brexit and also if you think about higher interest rates and there being a real alternative. So we did see some improvement in activity, but I think investor confidence remains low and therefore the activity remains muted relative to trend.","Eric Aboaf","And, Ken, when you look at the data in a little more detail and you do have it in our press release, to Ron\u2019s point, where you\u2019re seeing it flows into money market funds, into some of the more simpler ETFs, you\u2019re not seeing an underlying active mutual funds, collective funds and that\u2019s probably relatively true both on the institutional and the retail side. So that\u2019s a little bit of a -- what\u2019s driving our carefulness here.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","Hello. Thanks very much. Just two follow-up questions. I\u2019ll ask them together, because I think it\u2019s easier. But two things you mentioned on the call. One would be, if you could expand a little bit on the series of deposit initiatives that should yield growth in the second half, curious about that.","And the other one is a little broader of what things can you do creatively to strategically align with those faster-growing clients like insurance companies and asset owners? Obviously, big clients well broked, curious on what you\u2019re thinking to expand your relationship with them? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Glenn, it\u2019s Eric. Let me start on deposits and then I think Ron will take the client segment question. On deposits, we\u2019ve had a series of deposit initiatives dating back 18 months or more. I think we\u2019ve seen this gentle trend in clients becoming, I use the word, discerning, right, given the high rate environment and thinking about where they put their fund.","And so, we\u2019ve done a lot of work to step back around our share of wallet of their deposits and where they put their cash, right? Think about the cascade. Some of it is on our balance sheet, some of it is on our balance sheet and non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing accounts some of it. We help them sweep to money market funds, some of them we put in repo. Right?","There\u2019s a series of different avenues for them. And so, we\u2019ve become increasingly sophisticated, I think, over the last 18, maybe even 24 months, around tactically working with clients, being disciplined on deposit pricing on one hand, on the other hand using pricing functionality and some of those different avenues as places for us to support our clients.","So I think to be honest, one of the reasons why we\u2019ve done relatively well in NII and NIM is because we\u2019ve been so practical and tactical and kind of focused on those underlying opportunities. If I build on that, the next round of initiatives with clients builds on this kind of share of wallet information we\u2019ve built up and the kind of the discussions we have with them.","And it does a couple of things. It -- we\u2019ve segmented clients more broadly between small, medium large and different characteristics. There are some clients where we may provide some sweep functionality into money market funds that -- where their cash could end up on our balance sheet instead of in sweep accounts and that\u2019s kind of the sort of opportunities that we\u2019re looking at. But it\u2019s for segments and sub-segments of clients and it always has to be worthwhile to our clients and so we\u2019re actively working with a set of segments on that basis.","We\u2019re also to be honest doing a little bit of diversification in our deposit base. You saw that in my prepared remarks. I described some wholesale funding that we added, because we wanted diversified set of deposits given the environment and we\u2019ll continue to do that and while that might affect our overall deposit betas, I think what we\u2019re finding is our deposit betas for the underlying client business is relatively stable up through this time.","So a series of different initiatives and I think it\u2019s an ongoing part of our business process. But we -- I think we have a good understanding of where and how much and that\u2019s why as clients do become on average, more careful with their deposits, our view is that we should help them, become more careful with us with their deposits and bring more to us and I think there is more there.","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Glenn, why don\u2019t I pick up your second question there. As you know State Street\u2019s historic focus and it\u2019s served it well has been on the largest, most sophisticated typically asset managers. And that strategy has served us well. It\u2019s given us capabilities and enabled -- given us capabilities that many don\u2019t have and has enabled us to serve these clients well. What we\u2019re saying is, is that demands for some of those kinds of capabilities that we\u2019ve developed are starting to trickle down into these mainstream asset owner and insurance companies, although let me take them separately.","Asset owners, it\u2019s very hard now to find a pension fund that isn\u2019t in some way also an asset manager. Historically, they used to be asset allocators, their needs were simple and the revenue opportunities were relatively modest for them. That\u2019s changing. Some of them are insourcing, sometimes they\u2019re insourcing at the beta end, sometimes are actually insourcing at the very high-end in terms of what they\u2019re doing in privates. So as that sophistication is going up that lends itself to what we do. And we\u2019re taking that offering that we have for the high-end asset manager and tailoring it for those asset owners.","Insurance companies are a little bit different. Historically, they have truly bought in an unbundled way, so they\u2019ve separated custody accounting. For example, we are -- we have the number one market share in insurance company accounting, but we\u2019re nowhere near number one in terms of insurance company custody. Again, driven by the need for simplification of their own operations, you\u2019re seeing these things starting to coalesce, so we\u2019re trying to leverage that position we have in accounting to move it into custody and to other services.","At the same time, these insurance companies in their quest for yield are becoming more sophisticated in terms of what they\u2019re investing in. So the growth in private credit has given them -- or has created a need for new kinds of custody and accounting for these more elaborate instruments. We\u2019re the number two player in private credit administration and we\u2019re able to leverage that position with these insurance companies.","Glenn Schorr","That\u2019s awesome. Thanks for all that color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Eric, just a follow-up on the expenses. You reiterated the 1% lower for the year, but you also mentioned the influx bull with the backdrop. So I guess just curious, if you only expect fees to be flat to up 1% in 2Q with the markets rebounding so strong and the net interest income flat for the year, maybe what backdrop would you become maybe more aggressive on reducing the cost base? Because it seems like -- obviously, the markets are rebounded, but the rate backdrop has gotten a bit more challenging since the last call. So just wanted to get your view on what would pull like the expense levers versus the 1% lower?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, I think Michael we look at a series of different indicators to think through what we should do when. And it\u2019s ultimately a judgment call, but on that longer list is the interest rate environment. Right now we see long rates at 2.40%, 2.50% maybe a touch more, but if they take another discernible step down then we need to reevaluate, same thing if the fed cuts at the front end of the curve. Those are indicators to us that the times are going to be tough and there\u2019s going to be even more of a risk-off environment and that will then mean even less in trading revenues and servicing fees. A downdraft in the equity markets is another one right, if we get a 10% correction and that correction sticks, right? Let\u2019s say we had the December levels. December 31 levels still stick till today, right? That\u2019s another indicator that we\u2019re in a different environment.","So I think we\u2019ve seen these cycles before. We\u2019re trying to be careful in navigating small cycle, large cycle secular versus cyclical, but those are the kinds of indicators we\u2019re looking at. And then I think to be honest, on these quarterly calls, we\u2019re going to continue to update our -- confirm or update our guidance on expenses on the conferences that we do during the year. And as that environment adjusts we\u2019ll -- we\u2019re certainly going to keep you well informed of some of our intentions. And I think you\u2019ll see us put the same pressure on ourselves as you are considering, because we wrestle through that every day. And we know we need to deliver at the end of the day earnings and capital back to shareholders.","Michael Carrier","All right. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. You both mentioned some of the initiatives in place to improve the growth outlook whether it\u2019s the client coverage teams, the growth in client statements, the price committee. Is the plan, is it working? And when do you expect to start seeing the results? And with that -- because I think the other side of that is some of the pricing negotiations with clients, so maybe an update on just how far along you are now and what that pricing committee like provides in terms of the economic relationship with the clients?","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Mike, why don\u2019t I start there? The -- it\u2019s I\u2019ll get to your last point first. In terms of the pricing committee, it\u2019s not that this work wasn\u2019t being done, but it\u2019s being done in a much more intentional way in terms of weighing not just what the fee rate is, but how it gets implemented, to what extent is they\u2019re offsetting new revenues we can gather from the client sometimes consolidation. We\u2019re also very focused on timing, because oftentimes we find ourselves in a spot where the price cuts if you will were occurring well in advance of when new business was coming over. So you\u2019ll start to see the impact of that immediately and sometimes the impact is what we avoided. It\u2019s the dog that didn\u2019t bite, but it\u2019s very important in terms of how we manage the current income statement.","In terms of the other, when are we going to see fee growth is I hope you can tell it\u2019s something that we are laser focused on. And there\u2019s a lot of work underway, but these things take time. I would say that the -- with the client executives two-thirds of them are in place, but about half of those new client executives are actually from inside State Street, so they have a little bit of a leg up in terms of familiarity of both with State Street and the clients. So they\u2019re having impact already. The folks from the outside some have started. Some are yet to start. They have a very high quality, so they\u2019ll have impacts. It won\u2019t be just as quick. Over time, they may even have greater impact. But the other thing that we\u2019re focused on is really the \u2013 as we\u2019re driving the sales teams, we\u2019re trying to make sure they take a portfolio approach to this. We\u2019re obviously very interested and as we mentioned earlier have a significant pipeline in terms of front-to-back opportunities, but we also understand and these are major decisions on the part of a client, they take time. The good news about it is once they make the decision, it\u2019s not permanent but it\u2019s a pretty long-term decision because it will be hard to unwind. There\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about that pipeline. We\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll see several of those actually come to fruition this year. But at the same time, we haven\u2019t lost sight of what our bread and butter is. So if you look at the $120 billion of new business this quarter. And that was classic high-quality new business. 80% of it was competitive. So we won it from somebody else. It\u2019s stuff that can get installed in a reasonable amount of time, certainly for the most part sometime this year.","And then lastly, I would focus on we talked about how we\u2019re well on track for our Charles River synergies. The revenue synergies there are things that will have near \u2013 very near-term impacts on us. So a good example of it is, it\u2019s an existing Charles River client, where we\u2019ve now built in functionality where they can do markets business with us where they weren\u2019t doing it before. That has \u2013 easy to install that\u2019s basically flipping a few switches and then as their activity engages that will show on our bottom line. So it\u2019ll \u2013 the point I\u2019m trying to make is it\u2019s a mix of very long-term high-value kinds of business that we\u2019re focused on the core bread-and-butter business, and then finally these Charles River revenue synergies which in the immediate term have been mostly in the markets area.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hey, good morning. Hello?","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. A couple of questions one just digging in on the expense line a little bit. I know you indicated the guide for 2Q flat to up slightly, but then you\u2019ve got the full year guide that stays intact. And I\u2019m just wondering, if you could talk us through a little bit the outlook for 3Q 4Q if the \u2013 because what I\u2019m sensing is that there is a drop-off in the back half of the year. Maybe you could help me understand if that\u2019s right size it and what the drivers are for getting there?","Eric Aboaf","Betsy, it\u2019s Eric. I think \u2013 let me frame expenses this way all right? We said down 1% on an underlying basis ex-CRD right because that\u2019s the \u2013 that\u2019s a core expense base of the firm. And on that basis on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter, we were actually down 2%, so I think we\u2019re well on our way to begin to deliver on our down 1% for the year. I think in second quarter, you have the usual. You don\u2019t merits coming through and a little bit of expansion in something like Charles River, but we\u2019ve got saves coming through as well and we\u2019re just trying to offset. I don\u2019t know that those offsets will come every quarter but that\u2019s our intention. So I think we\u2019re off to a good start first quarter on a year-on-year basis and quarter-on-quarter basis. I think if we can hold expenses in the second quarter to the level that I described that\u2019ll be good progress.","And then I think third quarter, fourth quarter I\u2019m not giving specific guidance, but I think you can back into that given the kind of 2% down this quarter year-on-year ex-CRD my guide for second quarter. And then I think you can impute the second half of the year and take it from there.","Betsy Graseck","Great. Okay. And then maybe we could talk a little bit about the benefit to capital from the G-SIB surcharge going down as well as the eSLR that\u2019s likely to come out from the fed for you guys. Could you give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about managing the balance sheet, optimizing what you do with the callable prefs that might be out there?","Eric Aboaf","Yes. The capital there is one that is, I think evolving in a really nice way. I think first, we feel pretty good knock on wood around CCAR and our CCAR potential this year. So more on that in June. I think the development in the CCAR rules though is quite positive for us, right? If the SLR rule goes in as it\u2019s been published in the register that suddenly releases us for the tight constraint on \u2013 through the leverage ratio and depending on how you model it, probably frees up $1 billion, $1.5 billion of capital, which is quite material on our capital base of about $1 billion and I think could \u2013 it\u2019s something that we\u2019d certainly want to actively find ways to return to investors all else equal.","I think then if you go forward the G-SIB surcharge down 0.5 points from 1.5% to 1% on our capital base is worth $0.5 billion of capital roughly. Now all that, will intersect with how CCAR is run a year from now or two years from now whether we go to the SCB and so forth. So it\u2019s hard to predict exactly how and when. But I feel like there is certainly $1 billion plus tailwind coming through on capital through these various rule changes and that\u2019s positive. Exactly, how we monetize them first protocol is getting more buybacks or capital directly to our common equity holders. And over time, we\u2019ll also obviously take a look at the rest of the capital stack, but that\u2019s certainly the \u2013 I think the first place to start.","Betsy Graseck","Thanks, Eric.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow-up on the asset management side, if I kind of look at the disclosure around AUM across, whether it\u2019s mix across equities fixed income and cash, whether it\u2019s passive versus active it\u2019s pretty \u2013 it\u2019s very similar if not close to being identical to 3Q 2018 levels, but it seems like your guidance on revenues for next quarter it would be quite a bit lower than 3Q. So I\u2019m just trying to unpack maybe what\u2019s going on underneath the surface beyond what you\u2019re disclosing in terms of the fee pressure. Is it just pricing in ETFs? How do we think about the lower-level run rate despite pretty equal AUM?","Eric Aboaf","Jim, it\u2019s Eric. There are a couple different factors there that, I think that are \u2013 that are I think flowing through the P&L. And remember, we really have three large asset management businesses within our large complex where we have a cash business, which is quite tied to our sec lending activities and the cash that comes from the assets on loan. And I think you see those assets on loans be lower this year than they were last year as the market has kind of deleveraged and gone into more of a careful structure. And so the follow-on is that there\u2019s less cash for us in our cash business. And that\u2019s important, because that\u2019s historically been a good-yielding product from a fee perspective. I think the -- why we\u2019re confident in a first quarter, second quarter uptick is we\u2019ve seen some real upswings there and some -- and I think that will come back as markets normalize whether they come back and are higher than a year ago, time will tell, and we\u2019ll see as we go through the next couple months.","I think the second part of our large asset management business is institutional, where there is an underlying fee pressure. And that\u2019s certainly true as our -- as we provide some of those passive products. Some of that money is flowing out of passive and to be self managed by some of the largest institutions that we\u2019ve historically served around the world. And that\u2019s clearly why we built out that OCIO business and some of the active -- the other active facilities, but there\u2019s a rotation there that is -- that takes time to turn. And I think we\u2019re still in the turning mode and that\u2019s factoring through.","ETFs is a -- I think is -- has got a lot of different components. We\u2019re actually quite pleased with the performance of some of our products and some of the channels that we operate in. That low-cost core product is now well on its way to $30 billion, $40 billion of assets under management from a standing start 18 months ago. And that\u2019s where the market is going.","And I think the challenge in ETFs is that the market has shifted right to being a highly retail lower-fee product. And so there we are continuing to build out our offering in that space, while also actively driving growth in some of the other areas. High yield is an area of real strength for us. Some of the commodities, like, gold is an area of high strength. And part of what we\u2019re seeing is some of those product areas are in favor or out of favor, and at the same time, we\u2019re working hard on the various channels of distribution, because that\u2019s the other avenue of success there.","So I think more to come as we navigate some of the industry shifts in these -- in those three large asset management businesses and we continue to turn that in the right direction.","Jim Mitchell","All right. Well, fair enough, but maybe just switching gears on your excess capital comments with the change. It seems like at least last stress test you were constrained as much by other factors besides the SLR. So, just trying to think, is it that you just feel so much more confident given the balance sheet positioning that you\u2019re really constrained in CCAR? Is that a leverage component and that\u2019s going to free-up capital? I\u2019m just want to make sure I understand how much excess capital you think flow actually can be put to work?","Eric Aboaf","Yes. I think the -- if you look back at the CCAR not just last year, but the last half decade of CCAR, right? The principal binding constraint for us is the leverage ratio in effect, and how that plays through, right? Because CCAR has those four or five ratios, leverage is one of those and that\u2019s the one in which we hit the -- we have the low point relative to the requirement.","So I think what effectively happens with the change in the SLR and the leverage ratio rules is that constraint gets pulled back. And either we end up with exactly -- depending on how it gets written either that our constraint then shifts to that 1 constraint, all right a common equity Tier 1 constraint; or just a much lighter version of a leverage ratio constraint. I think in either case and this is -- it\u2019s hard to be sure until the rules get done and we actually run the stress test and so on and so forth.","I think you\u2019ve seen the same modeling that I have seen. That there is a $1 billion plus of capital at stake that will likely be freed up. The question is I think in the details. And I think we\u2019ll see more as the public rulemaking proceeds. As -- we\u2019ll see more as we go through the CCAR results in June. And we\u2019re hopeful that that\u2019s something we can build upon in the second half of the year from a capital return standpoint.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Most of them have been asked and answered, but just maybe to come back to the servicing fee line Eric, the guidance on the second quarter of fees flat to up 1%. If we can just maybe unpack the servicing and the asset management side of that. I mean, we do have markets up about 5% to 6% on an average basis, so I assume that would reflects well within your asset management business. But on the servicing side would that imply -- would your guidance imply servicing fees will be flattish or potentially even pressured?","And then just to go back for that re-growth of the servicing fees going forward, given the pricing pressure that is persistent versus the new business that you are adding on should we see those fees re-grow in the third quarter significantly? Or do we have pressure for a good part of the year?","Eric Aboaf","Brian, it\u2019s Eric. I think let me try to help out in a couple different areas. I think, first, when we said, fee revenues would be flat to up 1%, that\u2019s overall fees, right? So that\u2019s servicing fees, management fees, markets processing and other all added together, right? So I\u2019m trying to give you some broad guidance. And as we know more as the quarter develops, I\u2019m happy to provide a little more detail. So we think of that in aggregate.","I was clear that processing and other has a downtick coming, because of some of the events this quarter, and so I think I helped there. I think sec finance is likely to tick up, FX hard to tell given market volatility. And we are, I think, hopeful we\u2019ll see some uptick sequentially on the combination of management and servicing fees, just don\u2019t know how much.","I think if you try to work through the underlying math, I think take the S&P. The S&P at March 31, if it just stays at that level through the rest of second quarter, is up roughly 4% on daily average basis versus first quarter. And I\u2019m using my words precisely, just to help you with the math. I think the international indices may not be up that much. And remember, we also have a fixed income base and an alt space and so forth. And so you got to be careful about how much of that you factor in. I think that should provide some positive benefits, but pricing goes the other way and comes in in lumpy manners that we need to see. And then there is the flows and activity.","So I think we\u2019re -- we\u2019d like to see -- just like you all we\u2019d like to see some stability if not some uptick in the combination of servicing and management fees. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re -- the teams on the business side are intensely working on in the sales efforts that -- and the relationship efforts that Ron described are intensely focused on that. And I think we\u2019ll -- we need to take it as it comes. And I think in the interim, we got to be vigilant on expenses, which is why the hiring freeze started in December. It\u2019s still in place. And we\u2019ve got to continue to find ways to drive out costs. And I think we continue to look for more ways, new ways, additional ways because that\u2019s part of what this environment dictates.","Q \u2013 Brian Bedell","Yes. That\u2019s fair enough. And then to maybe just the medium-term targets that you have in the appendix, the 10% to 15% EPS growth. I think it\u2019s over three years if I\u2019m not mistaken, if you can clarify that. So that would be 2018 through 2021, but for this year, if we continue to have these revenue headwinds, it looks like at least on a GAAP EPS basis you would most likely be down year-over-year. So just the thought of how you regenerate that EPS growth in the out-years. Is this all from the CRD synergies or from more cost saves I guess?","A \u2013 Eric Aboaf","Brian, it\u2019s got to be a broad combination of those actions, right? I mean we\u2019re -- right now we\u2019re living in a different environment than we were in December. On the other hand, as shareholders ourselves and as representatives of what we need to deliver for our shareholders, we know that we need to find ways to drive earnings growth. We need to find ways. And we -- and if that doesn\u2019t come this year, it\u2019s going to come next year. And it\u2019s going to -- got to come the year after that. We got to find ways to return more capital which is why in a slower growth environment or a flat environment that we\u2019re in, we got to find ways to over-deliver on capital. And I think again some of these medium-term targets, we feel confident we should be able to do that and hopefully a good bit more on that front.","And at the end of the day, we\u2019ve got to find ways to drive growth in the topline and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, right? Part of the discussion we had on deposits and balance sheet and some of those initiatives part of the client-specific initiatives, on segments, some of the coverage enhancement is all critical to driving that -- to restarting that growth that we need. And the interim, as like -- as Ron said, we got to both drive that growth and take out expenses and operate the firm carefully.","Q \u2013 Brian Bedell","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Q \u2013 Gerard Cassidy","Good morning. Thank you. Can you guys share with us -- you talked a bunch about the front-to-back opportunities for you with your clients. And obviously, the Charles River acquisition supports that strategy. How many customers are currently if any have the full front-to-back product set from you folks? And what are some reasonable targets for the end of this year and end of 2020 of how many customers might actually adopt this type of product strategy from you folks?","A \u2013 Ron O\u2019Hanley","Gerard, its Ron, I\u2019ll take that. So as we\u2019ve talked about I think from beginning when we first announced the acquisition of Charles River that the front-to-back strategy would be long term. What you\u2019re talking about here when you do this is a fundamental change in the way that the client itself operates. Typically, they\u2019ve got to move off some existing systems. There are typically a panoply of proprietary or small outside things that they have to move off of so these take time.","I think that we suggested at -- when we first talked about this that we would expect to start seeing true front-to-back relationships in the 2020 time frame. We\u2019re actually seeing a much faster take-up -- a lot of interest. We report on that every quarter. There\u2019s a 110 active discussions underway. And we\u2019re very confident that we\u2019ll see more than one occur and get closed and installation beginning this year, but these are massive because they really involve all or most of what a client is doing to move over to our platform.","And I say all or most because even if it\u2019s most, it\u2019s still front to back because of the interoperability that I talked about when I was answering Alex\u2019s question at the beginning of the hour here. So that\u2019s how to think about it. It\u2019s occurring. We\u2019re pleased with the pace it\u2019s occurring. The take-up and the interest has been -- we knew it would be there. It\u2019s been better than we anticipated. There\u2019s a lot of people doing a lot of work on this. There\u2019s a lot of discussions underway. And from the team, we\u2019re about one now today. So I think that you\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll be able to be reporting on specific names later this year.","Q \u2013 Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then Eric, you touched on in your prepared remarks about the different reasons for the management fee number being impacted with the market conditions and so on. You also identified a mix shift away from higher-margin products by some of your customers. Could you elaborate on that area?","A \u2013 Eric Aboaf","Yes Gerard. We\u2019re really seeing the mix shift in two of the three asset management businesses that we operate certainly in ETFs by most, but mostly industry observers would tell you that somewhere between 70%, 80% of the flows into ETFs are now in those low-cost core products. And that\u2019s as opposed to some of the higher-margin products that we\u2019ve historically operated in. And so there is just a shift in the market that\u2019s playing through and our view is we\u2019ve got to compete in both that new low-cost area and also the higher-fee area, but that\u2019s one of the areas where we\u2019re seeing that shift.","I think the second one is in institutional. Like all asset managers, we always have some mandates that were priced two, three, four, five, six years ago. And there\u2019s certainly a lot of intense competition on the institutional side and so what we\u2019re seeing is kind of a rotation kind of the back book being priced differently over time from -- in those areas. So some of it is like-to-like product, and that\u2019s something where we need to continue to rebuild our capabilities, whether it\u2019s in fixed income and LTI, whether it\u2019s OCIO, because I think the only way to tackle that is by expanding and introducing some of those other higher fee areas, fee products to offset.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you everybody. I appreciate the insights.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","Hi. Good morning. So Eric, why don\u2019t you start-off with a question on capital planning? Just given the strength of the capital position you cited, confidence increasing that payout well above 80%; and the fact that the leverage ratios are expected to be defang, so to speak. Do you anticipate taking some additional capital actions, and specifically retiring some of the higher cost preferred just part of your upcoming submission?","Eric Aboaf","Steve, it\u2019s Eric. I think on capital, we\u2019re going to have to think about it in stages, right? So I think as we filed CCAR, at the very beginning of April, we\u2019re still not in a position where we know definitively what\u2019s going to happen to the leverage ratio. That will come later on. So I think in my prepared remarks, and I\u2019ve said consistently that we have confidence in delivering substantially above the 80%. That\u2019s kind of CCAR as we know it today without any rule changes, but that\u2019s because we\u2019ve adjusted our portfolio positions on the investment portfolio. We\u2019ve addressed some of those counterparty topics. And we\u2019ve actually continued to reduce risk, I think in a smart way. So that\u2019s kind of part one.","I think part two could be as we see the final legislation come through on leverage ratio that could provide a second opportunity for us on CCAR, but that could be June. It could be July. It could be August. It just takes time, and I think that will be another opportunity. And there\u2019s a third opportunity with the G-SIB surcharge change, but we need to kind of see these play out.","And so I think as I think about capital planning, I\u2019m kind of capital planning in phases, so to speak. With CCAR kind of as is as Phase 1, maybe leverage ratio is Phase 2. And -- but not all at the same time. I think then if we go down the path of what part of the capital stack, I think we\u2019d certainly like to start with our common equity holders. I think that\u2019s the most important area for us to return capital to. I think we owe it to our shareholders, and so that\u2019s the first priority.","I think we\u2019ll always look at some of the optimizations around prefs and around the rest of the capital stack, and that\u2019ll certainly be in the analysis that we do. And obviously as we get through that analysis and see some of these developments, we\u2019ll certainly refresh our outlook.","Steven Chubak","Thanks, Eric. And capital prioritization was quite helpful. Just one follow-up for me on net interest income, a couple of quarters ago, Eric, you challenged the notion that, that balance sheet, excess reserve levels, would ultimately determine the trajectory in deposits, and that we should really focus more on the H.8. And as I look back over the last couple of quarters, H.8 deposits are up about 3%. Your average deposits are down about 3% with more pronounced declines in non-interest bearers.","Recognizing that, that\u2019s more of an industry-wide phenomenon, but just with the benefit of hindsight, what factors do you think drove that discrepancy with the H.8? And as we think about the future deposit trajectory, given some of the actions you cited about improving deposit gathering in the back half, are you still confident that that\u2019s a reliable proxy that investors should track? Or how should we think about what\u2019s going to drive that trajectory from here?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. See that\u2019s a very thoughtful set of questions. I think you\u2019ve got to look at a lot of indicators for deposits. And I think in addition to some of the comments that you\u2019re pointing to, I\u2019ve also said consistently that there is a series of different deposit pools out there, right? There are retail deposit pools. There are custodial deposit pools. There are corporate deposit pools. And all three of those, if I simplify just a three, and obviously there are more factor into the H.8 report.","And so I think what we\u2019re seeing is an evolution where the institutional clients that we custody an account for becoming increasingly discerning as we operate in a higher rate environment. And they are in some ways probably more discerning than the typical retail client, who\u2019s got less at stake. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing play through in the industry. And I think as we see some of the peer reports in the regional banks, we see some of that corporate deposit money under pressure.","As we see the peer reports in the custodial banks, we see some of the custodial deposits under pressure, and then our view is we\u2019ve go to navigate through that. I would tell you that I think we have to do and continue to do a lot of work under the surface to perform as well as possible on NII and NIM.","And so for example, you saw this quarter our cost of funds on interest-bearing deposits tick-up, which on aggregate got to a beta of about 80%. And part of that is some of those wholesale deposits that we brought in, because that kind of mixes up as we diversify the deposit base.","But I\u2019d tell you the underlying beta for the kind of client deposits away from some of those wholesale sources, was closer to being in the mid-50% betas. And so those betas are I think stable. And so I think we continue to believe that you\u2019ve got to be incredibly detailed and nuanced in your pricing and in your activities and in your segmentation of deposits.","And that\u2019s the way to perform as well as possible hopefully outperform some of the industry trends, but I think the backdrop as we now see it is that deposits in aggregate seem to be lightening in the custodial space, not by a lot, but by a bit. And our job is to do everything we can to secure as many of those deposits as we can bring on our balance sheet, and keep with us and serve. And that\u2019s why you heard about some of those initiatives that I mentioned earlier.","Steven Chubak","Very helpful color. Thanks for taking my questions.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","Hi. In the appendix you highlight a desire to improve the pre-tax margin by 2 percentage points over the medium-term, over -- where do you define medium-term? And that 200 basis point improvement in pre-tax margin is off of what base? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. Mike, it\u2019s Eric. We set those targets out in December. Medium-term, we defined as three years, so 2019, 2020, 2021. And it was off of a base of about 28% margins. And as you can tell, we\u2019ve got work to do. We\u2019re not shy about that. We\u2019re not defensive about that.","We\u2019re -- we\u2019ve got real work to do. And part of that is margins are affected negatively when you see a downdraft in revenues. So that\u2019s on us. We\u2019ve got to turn-around that performance. Notwithstanding, that the market has not been conducive, but that\u2019s not a -- that\u2019s -- that just is, and we\u2019ve got to overcome that.","And we\u2019ve got to keep taking I think sizable action on expenses. So, we\u2019re highly focused on it. I think it will take some time to get there. But our view is we\u2019ve got to keep acting given the hand that we have and work towards those targets.","Mike Mayo","All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Q \u2013 Marty Mosby","Thanks. Eric, I wanted to ask a little bit about, your assumptions that you\u2019ve built into the deposit base. I mean now that the fed has kind of flattened out, is there some tail or conservatism that this trend kind of continues for a couple more quarters which maybe you can see the stabilization of that?","And then also wanted to ask you about, your plans for the investment portfolio, and what you could see in being able to take advantage of still taking a little bit more maybe different risk but -- and also taking advantage of higher rates that you have out there right now?","A \u2013 Eric Aboaf","Marty, it\u2019s Eric. I think Fed watching is an art and a popular one at that. I don\u2019t know how to be either conservative or optimistic about the Fed. I think at the end of the day they\u2019re quite clear and relatively transparent that there\u2019s not much of an intention to change short-end rates. I think the market is estimating there is more downside than upside to rates but we\u2019ll see.","The Fed has been I think pretty clear that it\u2019s kind of steady as she goes. I think the underlying question if that\u2019s the case is how does the economy play out towards the second half and the end of this year. And then is there a hike or a cut a year from now or around the turn of the year?","And then, I think there\u2019s a second question because it\u2019ll come through more quickly in the markets. It\u2019s based on the market\u2019s interpretation what they might do and other indicators what\u2019s going to happen in the long end of the rates. And do they fall from here? Do they stay at this level or is there some inkling of ticking up?","And I think the optimists might say for a bank that upticks would be nice. And I think we\u2019re just -- our view is you can\u2019t plan for that. You got to plan for the base case being kind of where we are today.","Anyways, hopefully that\u2019s -- at least gives you a sense for what we\u2019re thinking. I think on the investment portfolio, our view is that we should continue to put more of our cash to work.","We\u2019ve got a very significant kind of cash base on our books, which mean we can deploy that cash into other areas. We\u2019ve got $50 billion of cash at the various central banks. And that\u2019s -- some of that can be put towards high-quality liquid assets.","I think what you\u2019ve seen us do over the course of the last quarter, is continue to leg into a larger MBS portfolio as opposed to a treasury portfolio. That comes with some OAS spread opportunities and I think helps balance out the downdraft in rates.","And I think you\u2019ll see us continue in a very kind of high-quality liquid asset way, look for opportunities whether it\u2019s in agency MBS, whether it\u2019s some of the supras find opportunities.","And continue to mix this portfolio in the right way. I think we\u2019ve got a -- we have a nice allocation to treasuries, but I think treasuries we can thin down a bit as long as we stay in other agency products.","And that transition should help us at least to offset the lower rates that we\u2019re seeing today than we had at the beginning of the year. And I think the question is how much of that we can do.","And obviously that\u2019s supplemented for our abilities to grow the -- what is a smaller lending portfolio relative to the investment portfolio, but that\u2019s kind of the other avenue of field that we can work towards.","Q \u2013 Marty Mosby","And then, just revisiting the capital issue in a different way, if you look at above 80%, and then, assume that you don\u2019t want to go above 100%, how much do you need for organic growth if you kind of assume that your kind of -- and just without -- everything else status quo you kind of keep the ratios kind of migrating out and stability.","So how much -- this between 80% and 100% do you need some portion of that for organic growth? And then, that $1 billion-or-about in excess that would get freed up and SLR gets changed, would you have to wait till the whole next year or would you see a -- the ability of significant change like that being able to expedite in-year type of change in the plan?","A \u2013 Eric Aboaf","I think in the -- if you think about the SLR, I think you know and you\u2019ve seen banks do the annual CCAR ask which is submitted in April and comes through in June but there is other -- the way the rules are set up there\u2019s always an opportunity if we have -- if we were to have excess capital to go back. And ask the Fed and through that prescribed process for additional asks.","I\u2019m not -- and I think we don\u2019t have plans right now to do that all right? We don\u2019t have information to say that there\u2019s more capital but I think you\u2019ve seen banks do that. And we\u2019d certainly consider that if we had some legislative rule changes.","So, I think there is an opportunity there. We -- just as I said earlier in my comments we\u2019re going to take this in stages. First, get through CCAR in June. And then, just see if there are other changes coming.","Q \u2013 Marty Mosby","So then how much do you need in growth organic growth out of that between 80% and 100%?","A \u2013 Eric Aboaf","Yeah. I think that\u2019s a very interesting question right now. Because as we operate in I\u2019ll call it a flatter balance sheet environment, right with deposits more stable than up, then we actually don\u2019t need to accrete capital in the balance sheet in line with that -- with what would traditionally be a balance sheet expansion.","And I think in some ways that\u2019s what I like so much about our business. It\u2019s a capital-light business. It doesn\u2019t require a lot of capital accretion. How much it\u2019s -- how much is directly proportional to balance sheet growth? If there is let\u2019s say a year where there\u2019s no balance sheet growth? Then the answer is you don\u2019t need to accrete any capital and retain it on the balance sheet.","You can actually return it to shareholders. And so, I think we can take each year as it comes. And I think the kind of total balance sheet growth rate when it\u2019s flat, for example, is capital light in a sense. And can let us really I think reward our shareholders as they\u2019d like to be rewarded.","Q \u2013 Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.","Ron O\u2019Hanley","Thank you all. Thanks for your interest. And we look forward to further conversation."],"20490":["State Street Corp. (NYSE:STT) Q2 2016 Earnings Call July 27, 2016  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Anthony G.

Ostler - Senior Vice President, Global Head Investor Relations","Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, will speak first. Then, Mike Bell, our CFO, will take you through our second quarter 2016 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit your questions to two questions and then re-queue.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include operating basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our 2Q 2016 slide presentation.","In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors referenced in our discussion today; in our 2Q 2016 slide presentation under the heading Forward-Looking Statements; and in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them, even if our views change.","As with the past couple of quarters, we have instituted a new pattern of releasing our financial results on the fourth Wednesday of the month following each quarter end. As such, we expect to hold our third quarter earnings call on Wednesday, October 26, 2016.","Now, let me turn it over to Jay.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Anthony. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our strong second quarter results which reflect strong fee growth compared to the first quarter driven by growth in our core asset servicing and asset management fees and the seasonal uptick in securities finance.","Demand remains strong across our global client base as demonstrated by new servicing commitments of $750 billion in the quarter. Importantly, these results also reflect our success in implementing our multi-year digital transformation program, State Street Beacon, which is delivering savings and efficiencies as well as new product innovations for our clients.","As you may have seen in the news today, we announced that we have negotiated a series of agreements subject to final approval that we expect to resolve all pending litigation and regulatory matters in the U.S. related to our indirect foreign exchange business. We're pleased to put this litigation behind us. Matters of this nature can drain both time and resources, so where possible and appropriate we feel it is in our and our clients' interest to pursue settlements. Our previously established reserve will be sufficient to cover all the cost associated with these agreements.","I'd now like to turn your attention to slide five of our slide deck, as I want to highlight for you a number of developments this quarter that helped us make substantive progress against our 2016 strategic priorities. In support of our objective to become a digital leader in financial services we advanced a number of State Street Beacon initiatives. In the first half of 2016 we successfully digitized a significant portion of platforms that enable straight through processing of client transactions end-to-end. Some of the early successes here include faster cycle times, with end-of-day net asset values being delivered 20 to 30 minutes earlier and reduction of manual transactions.","Our fund administration digitization prototype is underway and expected to be rolled out to clients in the early fall. Our focus on driving growth from the core franchise resulted in asset servicing wins of approximately $750 billion in the quarter. This included the appointment of \u2013 by Deka Bank and Allianz Global Investors to provide a range of investment services for $538 billion in assets and the appointment as custodian and outsourcing partner for Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Company's Japanese investment trust business. Our new business yet to be installed now stands at over $1 trillion.","We experienced outflows of $35 billion during the quarter in our asset management business driven mostly by passive equities and reflective of official institution clients redirecting assets in response to economic conditions. Importantly these outflows are primarily in our low fee-based institutional products.","We continue to generate new business in our higher yielding product lines such as GLD, which is our gold ETF, active equity, multi-asset and institutional. For example, in the second quarter we launched 15 new ETFs at an average total expense ratio of 37 basis points. This is reflected in our favorable management fee revenues for the second quarter of 2016 and our outlook for management fee revenue growth remains positive for the second half of the year.","We continue to invest in support of our overall strategy and earlier this month on July 1 we successfully completed our acquisition of GE Asset Management. This transaction is a key step in our plan to invest in higher growth return businesses. It's also an important part of SSGA's continued evolution as a premier provider of solutions to clients. GE Asset Management has significant asset management capabilities including active management, alternative and outsourced Chief Investment Officer capabilities.","With our focus on expense management we have reduced expenses both on a year-over-year and year-to-date basis compared to the same period in 2015. State Street Beacon has been a key factor in this progress and is ahead of our original schedule. In fact, we're now expected to generate at least $140 million in annualized pre-tax expense savings in 2016.","We continue to prioritize returning capital to our shareholders. During the second quarter of 2016, we executed the final phase of our common stock purchase program announced in March 2015. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved a new $1.4 billion common stock purchase program following the Federal Reserve's 2016 CCAR process. Our 2016 capital plan also includes an increase of approximately 12% in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.38 per share, starting in the third quarter of 2016 subject to Board of Directors approval.","We'll continue to focus our attention and effort in 2016 on our strategic priorities. We expect this will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective to generate positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015.","Moving to slide number six, I'd like to discuss the opportunities presented in Europe and our strong franchise there. Despite the Brexit vote and the remaining uncertainty, Europe and the UK represent a significant opportunity for us. For instance, Europe is 35% of the world's assets under management and is expected to grow by approximately 30% by 2020. Slow GDP growth and a weak economic outlook reinforce high savings rates while lower interest rates are driving a search for yield that pushes funds out of deposits into other investments such as mutual funds and cross-border investments. In addition to Brexit, other trends that we're seeing are that regulatory changes and cost pressures are creating client demand for complex outsourcing services.","We have a deep and diversified presence in Europe, as we have nearly 11,000 employees in 12 European countries. 20% of those employees are in the UK with the majority being situated in nine European countries under our recently consolidated international bank which is based in Germany. Given this presence we have an organizational structure that gives us the potential to offer both passportable EU products and services tailored to European markets.","We're well-positioned to support our clients and gain new clients regardless of the jurisdiction. We are the leader in offshore servicing and grew our offshore assets under administration by 70% over the last three years while growing market share. We provide support of the global fund distribution of regulated products called UCITS in more than 70 countries worldwide. Similarly, we're the industry leader in ETF servicing with over 60% European ETF assets under administration market share.","Not including the impact of lower market interest rates, our short and long term outlook for our European business has not materially changed post the EU referendum vote. We believe the post EU referendum vote winners will be the firms with strength in offshore, in the UK and in pan-European fund structures, and an on-the-ground presence in key domestic markets, and demonstrated ability to partner with clients to navigate complexity. We believe State Street is well-positioned in these areas to take advantage of the short and long term growth opportunities in Europe and the U.K.","Now let me turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the second quarter and then we'll turn to your questions. Mike?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Jay and good morning, everyone. This morning before I start my review of our operating basis results, I would like to note that our GAAP basis results for the second quarter include two notable items. First on April 1, 2016 we sold the WM\/Reuters branded foreign exchange benchmark business to Thomson Reuters resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $53 million.","Second, we recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $58 million that reflects an increase in our reserve related to our previously disclosed review of amounts we invoice clients for certain expenses.","Now refer to slide seven in the slide presentation for a discussion of our operating basis results for 2Q 2016, and for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which I'll refer to as year-to-date.","By way of summary, 2Q 2016 results were driven by both strong sequential fee revenue growth and expense management. Operating basis EPS for 2Q 2016 increased to $1.46 per share from $1.36 in 2Q 2015 and increased from 1Q 2016, which included the impact from seasonality associated with retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes.","Year-to-date EPS decreased 3% compared to the same period a year ago driven by a decrease in year-to-date fee revenue primarily due to lower equity markets as well as lower net interest revenue, partially offset by share repurchases and lower expenses. Importantly, 2Q 2016 total expenses decreased compared to the year ago quarter, resulting in an expansion in pre-tax margin to 31.5% in 2Q 2016.","The first half of 2016 operating basis effective tax rate of 27.9% is lower than our current expectation for the full year 2016 of 30% to 32% primarily due to the timing of our tax advantaged investments.","Regarding capital, in 2Q 2016 we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased $390 million of our common stock.","Moving to slide nine, I want to highlight the strong positive fee operating leverage in 2Q 2016 compared to the year ago quarter. Strong progress in 2Q 2016, particularly on the expense front, positions us to continue to expect operating basis fee revenue growth to outpace operating basis expense growth for full year 2016 relative to 2015 under current conditions and excluding the GE Asset Management acquisition.","I'll now turn to slide 11 for a review of our 2Q 2016 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees decreased from the year ago quarter, primarily due to lower equity markets, and increased relative to 1Q 2016, due to net new business and higher global equity markets. Compared to the year ago quarter, the decrease in international equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, negatively impacted servicing fees. Average daily values for the MSCI Emerging Market Index decreased 19%, while the EAFE Equity Index was down approximately 14% relative to a year ago.","Management fees decreased relative to a year ago, also reflecting lower equity markets. Foreign exchange revenue decreased from 2Q 2015, due to lower volumes. Securities finance revenue was up slightly from 2Q 2015, primarily reflecting continued growth in enhanced custody, mostly offset by a lower seasonal benefit compared to the year ago quarter.","Moving now to slide 12, I would note that our operating basis net interest revenue has benefited from a higher Fed Funds rate at the end of 4Q 2015, as well as disciplined liability pricing.","Net interest revenue decreased from 2Q 2015, primarily driven by the reduction in size of our balance sheet, partially offset by liability pricing discipline.","Now let's turn to slide 13 to review 2Q 2016 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses were well-controlled in 2Q 2016, decreasing approximately 3% from 2Q 2015. 2Q 2016 expenses were nearly flat with 1Q 2016 when excluding the 1Q 2016 seasonal deferred compensation expense of $122 million for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. Compared to 2Q 2015, compensation and employee benefit expenses increased modestly, primarily due to increased costs to support regulatory initiatives and net new business, mostly offset by State Street Beacon savings. Importantly, other expenses decreased from 2Q 2015, driven by a significant reduction in professional services cost.","We now move to slide 15 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remain strong, which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to March 31, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased under the fully-phased in standardized approach, primarily driven by an increase in risk-weighted assets, generated by the FX volatility late in the quarter following the Brexit vote. The June 30 fully-phased in supplementary leverage ratio at the Corp increased to 6.1%, and the bank increased to 6.3%, primarily due to the preferred stock issuance in the second quarter. Please note that the capital impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management will be reflected in our third quarter 2016 capital ratios, and our estimate of this impact is noted on slide 16.","We repurchased $390 million of common stock in 2Q 2016, under our prior common stock purchase program, announced in March of 2015. And importantly, our capital actions included in our 2016 CCAR capital plan demonstrated our focus to return value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Moving on now to the next slide, let me briefly discuss our acquisition of GE Asset Management. The acquisition of GE Asset Management supports our plan to allocate capital to higher growth and return businesses. The purchase price was $435 million, subject to adjustments, with up to $50 million tied to incremental opportunities with GE. Excluding merger and integration cost, the transaction is expected to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the first full 12-month period as of July 1, 2016.","Moving to slide 17, I'll now provide an update to our 2016 financial outlook. Please note that all of my comments relating to our 2016 outlook exclude any potential impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management. Relative to the first quarter, second quarter results reflected strong fee revenue growth and well-controlled expenses. Importantly, we continue to target positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, assuming current market conditions.","Included in our expectation, to generate positive fee operating leverage is modest operating basis fee revenue growth for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015. Importantly, on the expense front, we now expect operating basis expenses to be approximately flat for full year 2016 relative to full year 2015.","Included in our expectation of flat operating basis expenses for full year 2016 is upward pressure on regulatory and compliance costs and expenses related to the installation of new business for the second half of 2016.","Contributing to the success in managing expenses has been the execution of State Street Beacon, our multi-year program to create cost efficiencies and to digitize our business. We now expect State Street Beacon to deliver at least $140 million in estimated annual pre-tax fiscal savings in 2016.","Moving on to net interest revenue, for full year 2016 we currently expect operating basis NIR to modestly exceed the high end of our static scenario of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. This assumes U.S. interest rates remain static and some additional central bank easing occurs outside the U.S.","So in summary, we're very pleased with the 2Q 2016 results, as sequential quarterly growth in fee revenue and strong expense control positions us well to achieve our 2016 financial objectives. Now let me turn the call over to Jay.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike. And Jennifer, we're now available to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question will come from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning, Jay and Mike.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Jay, I was just hoping you could share what the client reception has been so far to the digitization program and then, as you maybe look out a year or two, what do you think you will be able to do with this program in terms of servicing clients versus where you are today?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Appreciate the question, Ashley. The Beacon effort as you know, is designed to improve straight-through processing, so clean up a lot of the handoffs and the inefficiencies. But importantly, when you do that, the impact it has on clients can be pretty dramatic. So one of the examples that I referenced in my prepared remarks, I just push out a little bit. One of the things that we do in huge volume is, at the end of the day produce a net asset value based on the workings of the day in the daily fund business where we have a pretty significant position globally, and the production of that net asset value is critical from a timing standpoint, and once you get that, that feeds downstream distribution systems, it feeds newspapers and other communication vehicles.","We have seen through the most recent improvements in Beacon that we've been able to pull back that time of producing a net asset value 20 minutes to 30 minutes, which on an hour and a half window is significant. So our clients, who are ultimately concerned about satisfying their distribution systems, when we can deliver that 30 minutes early it gives everybody in the chain more time to react. It might seem mundane but to our clients it's a huge win.","I'd say secondly, we experienced in the first quarter a 20% reduction in the number of reconciliations that we do within the company. And again, that just improves not only cost but accuracy and how data flows back to our clients.","I think to your question ultimately, our vision or end game in this is not only to achieve the savings that are prescribed by Beacon but to the extent that we can digitize our internal environment and make it real-time to our clients, the ability to get information intraday, whether it's cash positions, whether it's risk management data, that's really where we're going with this and when we established Global Exchange a few years ago, that was done in order to take the benefit digitizing our internal production environment and start to provide information and analytic services to our clients, not just back office, but middle and front office as well. And in parallel, Global Exchange is introducing some exciting new products that give clients intraday access and insights to what's going on in their portfolio, all enabled by our ability through Beacon to digitize our internal environment. So, you've heard me say before, to me it is the next big thing in this business and we're making good progress.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you for all the color there. And maybe a question for Mike as well. Appreciate the NII guidance, but can you just walk through your thoughts on what your liability pricing initiatives are likely to do to the balance sheet and just anything we should be mindful of in terms of accelerated refis and impact on NIM?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Ashley. So first of all, I'd say from a liability pricing standpoint, we're really pleased with the success that we've had for the first six months of 2016. And at this point, I anticipate that that would continue into the second half of 2016. Specifically, we did increase the amount that we're charging for deposits, for example, in Europe when the ECB cut rates further in March. Obviously it's anybody's guess where the ECB will go from here, so it's a situation that we're watching carefully. But I would anticipate that we would look to move \u2013 at least in the near term, I would expect that we would move in lock-step with further changes with the ECB. So it's a situation that we're monitoring but I don't expect any change at this point from the pattern that we had good success with in the first half of the year. So as a result, I would expect that overall, the deposit levels that we saw in Q2 are likely to remain probably pretty close to that level over the remainder of the year. But again, it's a situation that's pretty fluid and one that we're watching pretty carefully.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you for the color and congrats on the quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, good morning. Mike, I was wondering if you could follow-up on your comments about the expenses. The Other line again, $255 million or so, really great control and a meaningful decline year-over-year. You mentioned professional services fees, but I guess I'd just ask you to walk us through, like is this a new run rate, are a lot of your professional services fees that you've kind of had to spend on in the past done and kind of the moving parts within your expense outlook, you mentioned some of the investments but I think that's the real delta into peoples' expectations thanks.","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Thanks, Ken. First of all, I appreciate the positive commentary on Q2 and I think those comments are well-deserved. I think, start off broadly and then go to your specific question. We feel really good, Ken, about the job that we've done managing expenses in the first half of 2016 and primarily I would focus on two areas that we've talked about previously. The first, as you accurately pointed out, we have done a good job at replacing a significant amount of the outside consulting expend with full time employees. And that's a real good trade economically, and we also expect that that will build a more sustainable infrastructure going forward. So we're real pleased around that.","Second, we're obviously real pleased with our success to-date here around project Beacon and as I alluded to in my comments, we were able to accelerate some of the savings for 2016 around project Beacon, specifically, we moved faster on management spans and layers than we had previously planned. We also captured more of the savings through the increase in straight-through processing that Jay described. So I think we've done a good job on all those fronts for the first half of the year. There are some specific areas that we expect upward pressure on expenses in the second half of the year, and there are three specifically, Ken, that I would highlight here. The first is, we're \u2013 we have known new business in the global servicing business and we will obviously staff to service that new business. And that includes for example, the Allianz business that we've talked about publicly. So that would be an example.","Now, specifically tying that to your Other operating expense question, we will actually have some expenses in the Other operating expense category because part of that arrangement includes a transition services agreement. It's basically a lift-out deal and so we have some transition service expenses that will show up in the second half of the year in Other operating expenses related to that particular piece of new business. So that's one.","Second, while I really feel good about what we've done in terms of managing regulatory spending, we are going to see some upward pressure in the second half of the year around regulatory spending, particularly as it relates to the recovery and resolution planning that's gotten so much press here. There's an October 1 deliverable that we're very focused on. There's also a July 1, 2017 deliverable that we're very focused on and that will inevitably push up the level of regulatory spend in the second half of the year.","And then just for completeness, I would add that while we accelerated some Beacon savings into the second quarter, I do expect that we'll accelerate some Beacon investments in the second half of the year. So from a net-net standpoint, I would expect Beacon to entail additional spending in the second half of the year as compared to the second quarter run rate.","Now, all of that needs to be thought about, Ken, in the context of positive fee operating leverage for the full year. We are absolutely as a management team riveted on achieving that for the full year. So for example, if the fee revenue environment looked softer than it is right now, we'd have to look even harder at expenses in the second half of the year.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great color, Mike. And just to follow-up, two of the legacy issues that you spoke to in the press release, the FX seems like that's now behind and also does this client billing true-up, on a GAAP basis, does that put that issue behind now as well?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So first of all on the FX piece, it does resolve the U.S. litigation that we have. And we continue to expect that the overall accrual that we have set up, which is $585 million, will be sufficient for all known issues. But again, it was the U.S. piece in particular that we feel real pleased putting behind us with this announcement.","On the billing piece, Ken, the main point that I would make there is that at this point, we've completed our calculations at the client level. And I cannot emphasize enough that was just an extraordinary amount of detail going back, invoices over 18 years, literally millions of invoices at the client level. And our previous calculation had been in aggregate. So this refinement caused the update to the accrual. And I mean at this point, we're confident in the calculations we've done at the client level. But we're now \u2013 the next step is really now underway as we speak, which is we're now reviewing this detail with the impacted clients. And that's really the next step ahead of us and again, in putting this prior-year issue behind us.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks for color, Mike.","Operator","Your next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Maybe just a quick question on the living will, one of your peers discussed that changing to a single point of entry could increase expenses and higher long term debt costs. Is that a similar issue for you or how should we think about that for you guys?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Jim, this is Jay. That's not a similar issue for us. We have pursued a single point of entry strategy from the beginning and continue to pursue that. So for us, it's more about absorbing the input from the Fed and the FDIC and marching to it. As Mike mentioned, the October date, and importantly, there's even more work to be done for the July, 2017 date but we have a pretty clear mandate for what we need to do and it's a matter of executing against that. So, no big shifts in strategy with regard to resolution.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. That's really helpful. And then when we think about \u2013 the second question on the Deka Bank onboarding, it sounds like that's happening reasonably quickly. Is that the right conclusion? And when we look at the impact on expenses is that half of the growth? How do we think about the impact on your guidance of flat when you're tracking down in the first half?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me start that one, Jim, and just give you a little bit more color on the Deka and Allianz Global Investors business. It's a large transaction as you could probably figure out from the size of the assets that we'll be servicing. One major component of it, which will be enabled beginning in the third quarter, is a large fund accounting operation, which spans Germany and Luxembourg, which adds to our Luxembourg leadership position, and creates a leadership position for us in Germany, which we think is a key marketplace. So we will take it over beginning of the third quarter. Revenues and expenses will go with that. As Mike mentioned, not unusual for a deal like this. Initially, we'll take it over intact as a transition agreement, and then we'll evolve it to our systems, and that will happen towards the end of the year. So that's a little bit of color on Deka and Allianz Global Investors. And, Mike, proportionality to the expenses?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Jim, It's Mike. So, I'd really prefer not to get into specific numbers around client-specific arrangements, but I think it's fair to say, Jim, that it's part of the overall upward pressure that I mentioned in my prepared remarks around operating expenses for the second half of the year, relative to Q2. Some of it is to support net new business, including the Deka Allianz win. Second would include the upward pressure, given what we need to do around RRP. And then, third is the additional Beacon investments. I'd rather not get into more detail. But I think it's fair to say, on the net new business, that we expect that to help fee revenue for the second half of the year, as well as be an area that we spend some money to service. So that's all thought of as we gave you the updated outlook for full year 2016.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, right. So it sounds like the revenue is coming in coincidental with the expenses. So that's great. Thanks.","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Correct.","Operator","Your next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Good morning. A couple of cleanup questions again around expenses. So the $140 million of Beacon savings this year relative to I guess, $100 million that you guys talked about in the past, is that just simply the faction (35:21) of timing or the size? In other words, did this take away from some of the savings we should think about for next year or the size of the ultimate savings got \u2013 was increased in your view?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So Alex, its Mike. At this point, we're still maintaining the $550 million net savings target for the full program. So I would suggest that you think about this as accelerating it into 2016. Now, I would note that we have not changed our outlook for 2017, so we still expect that increment to remain intact. So, therefore, you could deduce it's the savings in the out-years that are being brought up, some brought into 2017 and then some of the 2017 and beyond into 2016. Particularly around the areas that I mentioned, the improvement in the straight-through processing and the reduction in management spans and layers.","Again, this will be a program, Alex, that I suspect we'll continue to give you updates over the next several years. So, stay tuned. The main point I'd reinforce is, really are doing a nice job in terms of executing on this program, and I would expect that to continue.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got you. And then a quick follow-up around the GE deal, and how we should think about it in near term, as well as longer term. So, I think you gave us the dollars in terms of revenue, so I was wondering if you could give us the expenses for the back half of the year that's going to come in with this deal. And then I guess, more importantly, as we think about this business phasing into State Street, what are the cost savings that you expect to realize from integrating it?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Alex. Let me first reinforce the numbers that we talked about in the slide presentation. So, overall, for the first 12 months of the arrangement, so July 1, 2016 through June 30 of 2017, we expect the overall revenue contribution to be in the range of $270 million to $300 million. And while we haven't given you the specific expenses associated with it, given that we indicated that we expect this to be accretive in terms of overall EPS, and you can also look at the cost of the prefs that we issued in second quarter to essentially fund it, you can get a pretty good estimate of the first 12-month financial expectations for the overall arrangement.","In terms of the Q3 contribution, we expect that the revenue for Q3 will be approximately $60 million, and we expect the contribution to pre-tax earnings, if we exclude the merger and integration cost, to be a modest positive. So think of it as something in the less than $5 million contribution here for Q3.","So, in terms of where we go from Q3 to the following three quarters, I would note that we expect the expense synergies to really begin to materialize in Q4 and then ramp up further in Q1 and Q2 of 2017. And then, from a revenue perspective, we do expect to grow that $60 million in third quarter to something higher than that number in the first and second quarters of 2017, which is what gets you from a, call it a $240 million annualized number, in Q3, to something in the $270 million to $300 million range for the first full 12 months.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And this $5 million number, that's net of the pref cost?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh, no. That's truly just the contribution of the business organization itself, and it's actually a little less than $5 million. So think of it as a modest contribution. But again, importantly, we are highly confident in our ability to get synergies through the combination of this organization, which is really terrific. I mean, 270 terrific employees, a little over 100 institutional clients, a fair number of them are actually overlapped with State Street's client base in the past. So, again, we're really jazzed up about the synergies here.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And Alex, just a footnote. We had set a 90% client retention rate. We achieved 95%, which was not shocking, but positive given what our expectations were.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, yeah. Understood. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning, folks.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Mike, thanks for all the expense detail. That's real helpful. Maybe, is it possible to talk a little bit about the trajectory of the Beacon saves? The $140 million, maybe if you can talk about the exit run rate in fourth quarter, or actually, the actual fourth quarter run rate of savings. And then as we go into 2017 for the $125 million, how you see that running through 2017. And then, I know it's early, but, essentially, it sounds like you're pulling some of the expense saves in from the outer years, so should we expect this project to be completed potentially by 2020?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, let's see, a number of questions there, Brian. First of all, let me give you an important data point here. On a year-to-date basis, our Beacon saves for year-to-date 2016, relative to the same year-to-date period in 2015, was approximately $75 million. So, essentially, I mean, if you doubled that, you'd get to $150 million. And, basically, that syncs up with the point that I was making, that we expect now the full-year savings to be approximately $140 million for full-year 2016, versus full-year 2015 starting point. So you can conclude from that arithmetic that we expect some additional net spending on Beacon as we invest in particularly some IT areas in the second half of the year, as compared to the quarter two expense base.","So, from a run rate standpoint, I think you can think of it as we'll be leaving full year 2016 at something pretty close to our current expenses. And again, a little bit higher net Beacon spending pushing that. So the savings number for the full year being a little bit less than what you'd get if you doubled the year-to-date savings number.","Again, in terms of 2017, I'm sure we'll provide additional updates between now and the beginning of 2017. I think the main point is that we still expect the 2017 savings to be on top of the $140 million of savings that we expect to achieve in full year 2016. So, it should give you confidence that the pace here is actually accelerated. And I wouldn't, at this point, try to either change the $550 million full program target, or to change the end date. But, again, it's something that I'm sure we'll continue to give you updates on in the future.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, that's helpful. And then, maybe to follow-up, on the net interest revenue outlook, can you just talk about what you're assuming there for the long \u2013 let's say for the 10-year Treasury yield, and whether you think there is any potential for raising any long term debt in conjunction with the resolution planning?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So, Brian, in terms of the net interest revenue, I believe, if my recollection is right this morning, I think the 10-year is at about 1.55%. And so, what we've assumed in the updated NIR forecast that we gave you is static rates in the U.S., and then, likely some easing by the Bank of England, probably in August. And so, it's really the combination of the grind in the portfolio, as the existing portfolio rolls over and gets reinvested at lower rates, coupled with this likely easing in the UK, are obviously factors that are putting some negative pressure on the second half of the year net interest revenue.","As it relates \u2013 actually, one other data point, before I forget it, in the Q2, we did note on slide 12 of the slide deck that we did have \u2013 it was actually four discrete securities prepay. So it was unscheduled redemptions in Q2. That contributed $5 million of positive NIR in Q2. We don't expect that to repeat in Q3 and Q4. So if you're really \u2013 if you're doing the modeling, I would suggest you sort of start with a $541 million rather than a $546 million. Again, just, it will help the modeling make more sense.","Your last question around the debt. I don't expect at this point to have to issue additional long term debt just because of the RRP. Again, we're working on a longer term capital plan that does ultimately include compliance with the proposed TLAC requirements. Now, again, TLAC, at this point, is a proposal, not a final rule. But as it relates specifically to your point around RRP, I don't anticipate having to issue long term debt just because of RRP. But again, the whole RRP situation is a pretty fluid one, as you can imagine.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. Okay, that's helpful. I'll get back in the queue for a couple of follow-ups. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Adam Beatty with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you and good morning, I wanted to ask about the positive mix shift in asset management fees. And, obviously, there have been some outflows and some other factors that State Street doesn't necessarily control. But wanted to get your thoughts on the strategy there. You noted that you're introducing a suite of products that have pretty good fees associated with them. How much can you kind of target a positive mix shift, and how do you go about doing that with your products and your clients? And should we expect a run rate on that, or perhaps even more leverage? Thank you.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, thanks. Let me pick that one up. So first point is that, in the quarter, we had $35 billion of outflows, mostly passive equities and separate accounts and not ETFs. And I would say the other theme, which I referenced, is sovereign wealth funds, mostly oil-based sovereign wealth funds, looking to reallocate. We have been focused for some time on introducing new products that have higher yields to them from a standpoint of the fees and, more particularly, the management fees, and we've had good success with that. I referenced some of the new ETFs we brought out. That's a continuation on a theme. I'd also add that GLD, the gold fund, is probably more of a product for the times. But we've had great traction in our active quant equity products, which are doing nice from a performance standpoint, and therefore, the flows are coming in nicely, high-fee products, from our standpoint, the multi-asset class.","And so, I would say it's been a conscious effort for the last, I would say, 18 months to 24 months, to focus on those higher-fee products. And I think we're making headway. If you look at the first quarter and the management fee growth of almost 5%, some of that's market, but some of it is a reflection of the mix shift. And as we sit mid-year looking towards rest of year, we expect to continue to see growth in the asset management business. Mostly based on introducing higher yielding products and getting positive flows into those products. I think that the commoditized end of our world tends to move with markets and other events. As you know, we have the largest ETF in SPY, the S&P 500, which trades pretty actively. But our strategy consciously is to move to the higher end of the product spectrum.","Last point I would make, Adam, is that the GE Asset Management business is a really big add in supporting that strategy. And that not only do we think we have a great opportunity to compete in the outsourced CIO marketplace, given what GE brings, but GE brings a mix of more active products, high fee products that can be sold as standalone. But even more importantly, as part of a bundled mix to provide solutions, whether it's in a 401(k) setting, outsourced CIO, or other elements of the risk spectrum.","Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Jay. I really appreciate that. That's great color. Also wanted to ask about the slide on Europe and the opportunities there, which was interesting so soon post-Brexit. And thinking about the competition there, both sort of U.S. domiciled and European domiciled, what would you say are the one or two biggest advantages that State Street has versus the competition, and maybe one or two of the bigger challenges? Thanks.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Let me pick that up, Adam. I think my Brexit-related comments, the only caveat I would make is that to the extent that Brexit and the EU bring down global growth or broad-based interest rates, that's outside of this commentary. But if you look at Brexit and our European strategy, we have a different business. So our business is driven by asset pools. Both pension, insurance and investment asset pools. So, if you think about managing and servicing assets, that's the starting point.","We've seen, in the last couple years, as the Eurozone has had increasing economic pressure, savings rates go up. Savings rates continue to be pretty high in countries like Germany, Italy, France, and those products increasingly are not only growing, the asset pools are growing, but the assets are moving out of banks into investment products. So the environment there is quite good generally.","Enter Brexit. Tremendous uncertainty about what Brexit means and how the UK will ultimately disentangle from the EU, and I'm sure it will take a long time for that to unwind. But from my standpoint, if you look at it through investment products, there are several structures that exist in Europe. And importantly, in Europe, as opposed to the U.S., which is one homogeneous market, Europe, you've got 20 different markets. And so, the notion of passporting or creating product in one domicile and being able to sell it across the Eurozone, is critical to success for an asset manager in Europe. And so it's likely, and there are some product structures, Oeics, SICAVs, UCIT. Oeics, for example, are created in the UK and they're passportable to the Eurozone. To the extent that the break between the UK and the Eurozone results in folks having to transition Oeics to things like SICAVs, then we're there to do that. We're the largest provider of these services across 11 different markets.","Significantly, I think the big winners will be the offshore centers. Luxembourg and probably, more importantly, Ireland, who have been the winners in the last couple years with regard to flows. So that's kind of the landscape. That's why we view the Brexit event to be neutral, if not positive, given that we have the most comprehensive set of services across the most markets in Europe.","From a competitive standpoint, when we acquired Deutsche Bank's business some years ago, it really catapulted us into leading positions in Germany, Ireland, the Intesa Sanpaolo deal gave us a leading presence in Italy. We've always been in the UK. We've built out our Luxembourg presence. So there's nobody near us with regard to servicing investment products, with the most geography covered across the most asset classes.","I would say, secondarily, that the U.S. firms probably are more competent in the offshore centers of Lux and Dublin than the European providers would be. There's a couple of European providers that can provide Pan-European servicing, but pretty limited. So I would say we are at the top of that pyramid. Some of our U.S. competitors have component parts of the European puzzle, but nobody has as comprehensive a servicing capability as we do in Europe. Hence, the enthusiasm.","Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Very nice. Thank you. Look forward to updates in the future. Thanks again.","Operator","Your next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one quick one on revenue here first. So, it looked like your servicing fee rate ticked up here this quarter. I know you guys commented on new business wins. So, is it right to assume that that rate and that sort of fee level would be sustainable and it's just a mix shift given some of the wins that are there this quarter?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Brennan, it's Mike, as we've talked about before, there are a number of things that can impact that calculation that you described. So I would \u2013 and actually in particular, the net new business has been positive here for a while. And as I talked about in the prepared remarks, we expect net new business to add to overall GS fees in the second half of the year relative to the Q2 run rate. But I wouldn't \u2013 again, please remember that only approximately 60% of the GS fee revenue is driven on basis points on assets. So, swings in the market, for example, can play havoc with the ratio that you're referencing.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, I get it, but it's the only way we basically have to model your revenue. So that's what we're left to do in the valley of the blind. But anyway, that's fine. I appreciate the commentary. And then one more clarification point also on the expense front. Seems like you had indicated some upward regulatory spend in your comments, Mike, and so was just curious about how that was going to manifest itself in the P&L. It seemed like you all had gotten some success in shifting some of that professional services spend up to comp. And so, are you saying that we might see a little bit of an uplift from the 2Q levels in professional services or is that rather going to come through on the comp line?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Brennan, First, I appreciate the compliment and we have had good success making that change that you described. I do expect that there will be a little bit of upward pressure on the comp and employee benefit line from the regulatory expenses but I think the majority will likely show up in other operating expenses, particularly given the very tight time frames that we're dealing with around the resolution and recovery planning in particular. I mean the October 1 deadline is very real, obviously, rapidly approaching, and as Jay indicated, the July 1, 2017 one is very meaningful as well. So for both of those reasons, I would expect that outside consulting expense will increase in Q3 and Q4.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Sure, but that would probably then just follow the same pattern that you all were able to execute in \u2013 over the longer term once you get past the near term deadlines, shifting that into a sort of lower priced but comp-oriented mix down the road is that a reasonable assumption?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's a very fair assumption, Brennan. Absolutely.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks for taking my questions. Jay and Mike, I had a bigger question if you kind of back up a little bit. This quarter feels like one of the things we've been looking for is an inflection point in some processes and pressures that you've been kind of working your way through. Mike, I got two for you and I got two for Jay. When you look at, Mike, the efficiency, you've been investing in the efficiency, how far along do you feel like we are? Are we getting to that point where the benefits are going to outweigh the investments? And then also on the balance sheet restructure, we've been in that for a couple of years which really started with the liquidity coverage ratio and capital requirements. Have we kind of come through that because we're starting to see NIR starting to grow again. So have we kind of gone through the inflection point on those two things?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Marty. Let me take both of those. First, from an efficiency standpoint, sure, I feel very positive that in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015, project Beacon generated $75 million of net savings. Now, we invested in there, but the point is, it contributed $75 million of net savings. And so I \u2013 yeah, I do believe that project Beacon has already shown that it's accretive in the near term.","In addition, I would point to the success \u2013 as we've talked about with several of the other analysts, the success we've had in moving the regulatory expense to lesser expensive full-time employees rather than expensive outside consultants. I think that's also an important inflection point that has helped us.","Now it doesn't mean that there isn't upward pressure on regulatory expense, particularly around RRP. But I do think that we've shown that we are executing on the plan that we had previously communicated which is to make that shift which ultimately saves us money.","On the balance sheet restructuring, I do feel positive about where the balance sheet is positioned. I mean, I don't think we have to look any further than the results of the last CCAR that are now public to note that our mark-to-market sensitivity under the severely adverse scenario is quite a bit better than what it had done previously. And so that was an important step forward for us from a balance sheet restructuring. At this point, we're fully compliant with the LCR rules. So, yeah, I feel good about all of that.","Now again, the one area that hasn't hit an inflection point yet is really market interest rates. I mean, maybe the Fed will increase again in the reasonable near future. But the \u2013 outside of the U.S., it's still been moving in a negative position. So that's the area that I would say we haven't yet hit the inflection point but I'd like to believe at least in the U.S., maybe that could come sooner rather than later.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Then, Jay, when we look at the ability to take the cloud, we've invested in since building out the new resources and information, we're talking about those new products, you seem more confident in that but as we're talking about that in terms of generate some revenues from those newer services that we're going to get from the data out of the cloud. And then also, you are guiding a transition from building out your ETFs to really now putting in GE and becoming more active management, higher fees, so is that transition starting to kind of go through an inflection point that you can start to see some build-out?","And then, Jay, just overall, State Street's gone through periods in the past where you've had to go through these transitions. It set the stage for very good performance after you went through these inflection points. Just if you would kind of comment on how your thoughts would be compared to past inflection points that we've seen.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Happy to do that, Marty. Yeah, I do think this is an inflection point. I think you started out with a cloud and Beacon and that is critically important from a standpoint of managing cost in a difficult environment, but even more important relative to continuing to differentiate our services, vis-a-vis the competitors and the interest of what clients are looking for today. So the first point I would make is that some of our successes in the marketplace are not only a reflection of us producing better capabilities, better products, information-based services, but it's also a reflection of the pressure that our clients are feeling in a low return environment to outsource more work. So I would put that in the inflection point transition bucket too. I don't see that slowing down anytime soon, so whether it's a mutual fund manager moving to outsource middle office or in the alternatives world moving from hedge, now private equity and real estate, there's a surge to outsource those things. So I think it's a convergence of more outsourcing driven by the environment and our client base based on our continued ability to differentiate our product sets and compete effectively at good pricing to win new business. I think that's a trend that we're likely to continue to see and the cloud and Beacon is right at the center of that because this business trades more and more on the ability to provide analytics and information and insight from the processing work that we do, and that's going to continue. The other thing I could add is the regulatory pressure on our clients again is forcing both of those things to happen.","I think similarly in the world of asset management, we have been on a journey the last couple of years, to transition, I wouldn't say completely pivot, but transition our business to maintaining those core products that we have but building out our ETF distribution capabilities in the U.S. and Europe, investing in higher-yielding products. I think the GE acquisition potentially is an inflection point for us. In the world of solutions, which is a huge opportunity for everybody in asset management, you need to have enough asset classes and competencies to be able to mix them together to create outcomes, and GE just provides an enormous new set of capabilities for us to compete more effectively in that world. And so, I would say it's ETFs, it's not necessarily single asset class products that we'll deliver to the marketplace, but this notion of solutions is going to continue to be a key theme in the asset management world, and I think we're well positioned and the GE transaction just puts us over the top with regard to capabilities that we can leverage across our global institutional distribution system to continue to grow.","So I do feel like we're passing through a period here where we're getting our costs better aligned for the realities of today. We're moving digitally which is where the future is going to be with regard to the clients' needs, and I'd say asset management is going through a similar transition.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I had a question on the NIM, you were able to keep that essentially flat Q on Q, and while yields came down a bit, cost of funds came down more. I'm just wondering on the cost of funds side, you had some nice decline in the non-U.S. transaction accounts and I know you've been charging depositors non-operating charges. But I'm wondering what happened in the quarter that enabled a pretty big step down in the non-U.S. transaction accounts?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Betsy. It's Mike. Two items that would I highlight around that line item on our average rates earned and paid page. Two points impacted that favorably for the quarter. First of all, as you correctly pointed out, we did increase the amount of what we're charging for deposits at a greater pace than the cut, for example, in the ECB rate. So that helped that line item in particular, Q2 versus Q1, the greater amount that we were charging for European deposits in particular.","Second though, it's a little bit of a funny nuance. We do have in any given quarter decisions to make around whether we swap the non-U.S. deposits into U.S. dollars and put them with the Fed or whether in fact we leave them outside the U.S. at central banks abroad. In particular, for a variety of technical reasons, we swapped less to U.S. dollars in Q2 than we had in Q1. And so what that meant was, the FX swap costs that we normally run through that line, that was a \u2013 there was a smaller charge for that in Q2 versus Q1.","So it had a similar impact on the asset side as it did on the liability side, so no net impact to the NIM. And in fact you can see the decline in the interest bearing deposits with banks line item that is essentially the partial offset to that. But from an economic standpoint, the piece that I would focus on is the more disciplined liability pricing, particularly outside the U.S.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, and is there more room for that to run from here?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, obviously it's a situation that we're monitoring very carefully. At this point, I don't expect that we would see even greater daylight for example in EMEA between what we are charging for deposits and for example the ECB rate. But again, it's a situation that we'll monitor carefully and if the ECB moves more negative, it's something that we'd have to look at carefully.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, I just ask because you mentioned there was a couple of small, but one-timers in realizing some gains in the first \u2013 in the second quarter, so as those roll off you've got some opportunity to squeeze liability cost to keep NIM flat in 3Q?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, again, first of all, I would take that $5 million out. You see that in the ABS line, those were four discrete prepayments that I do not expect to repeat in Q3. So I would calculate the NIM with that $5 million out of there. And in terms of Q3 and Q4 outlook for NIM, unfortunately, the two main known-knowns are the likely reduction in the Bank of England rate and then just the continued grind in the portfolio as it rolls over if rates stay static. So, I'd say at least near term there is more near term downward pressure on NIM. But that's factored into the points that I made in the prepared remarks and the fact that we expect to be probably modestly above the upper end of the $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion range.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","I just have one quick question, or maybe two here. So, you had some peers that were talking about looking to lower non-operational deposits still. But given you just went through a program of lowering non-operational deposits and looked relatively healthy for the SLR and also for CCAR, would you look to actually, if you had the opportunity to expand the balance sheet further if you saw some more chances to add deposits here at this point in time?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Brian, it's Mike, at this point we really feel very positive about the size of the balance sheet and the success that we've had over the last five quarters in managing downward the overall level of excess deposits. So, they were up very modestly Q2 versus Q1 on average, but I don't at this point feel pressure to reduce those further in the second half of the year. And, with any good fortune here maybe in 2017 we'll get some additional Fed Fund increases, maybe even in December and that would probably reduce them further on their own without explicit action. But it's something obviously we monitor very carefully, and particularly in situations where there's potentially a flight to quality, it's something that we'd have to watch very carefully. But at this point, we're really comfortable with the overall size of the balance sheet and the level of excess deposits here in Q2.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And was there any fee waivers left in the second quarter? I know it's not a big deal for you, but just curious.","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, nothing meaningful.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Hello. Thank you for taking the question. Can you give us an update on the search for the new CFO?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, I'll give you a quick one, Geoff, which it's progressing nicely and I would expect in pretty short order, we would have something to report, so we're getting near the end of the process and I'm pleased with the way the process is going.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Then, you clearly went through a similar exercise two years or three years ago, can you just explain where your focus this time is maybe a bit different from where it was in the past?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say we're looking for a world-class CFO of a financial institution, and fortunately the \u2013 what I've found, and you never know, but in this case it's encouraging, is that the State Street brand still has enormous pull in the marketplace. I think people like our story, like our prospects for moving through this regulatory environment. Like the growth story, so we're going to have good choices.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, Jay. Good morning, Mike.","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hello?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Sorry about that. That's okay, and it's been a long call, I know. Mike, can you share with us in the investment securities book, your yield held up well in the quarter and I noticed some of the pieces you gave us, the yields fell for example in the mortgage backed area. But in the asset backed securities area, you had a nice pop in the yield in that portfolio. Can you share with us what was purchased in there or how are you maintaining that 1.92% yield for the entire portfolio?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, so let's see, a couple of different questions in there, Gerard. First, as I mentioned a couple times, we did have four specific securities that were in the asset backed securities category prepay in the second quarter, and the result of those four discrete securities prepaying in total, was a one-time boost to NIR in Q2 of $5 million. So I would urge you to wash that $5 million out of the ABS number. So if you do that, the 1.43% yield for ABS that you see on the average rates page would in fact be closer to flat with the 1.32% from the quarter before it.","If you take that piece out, the main factors are the things that we've talked about, which are on the positive side, we've continued to do a very good job of liability pricing discipline and in fact, got some benefit from the higher level of charging for deposits in \u2013 for the euro deposits in particular. Going the other way though, was in fact the impact of the continued grind, where the maturing fixed rate assets tend to mature at a rate lower than the new fixed rate investment. So again, it's a moving picture, obviously, but I'd first wash out the $5 million and then those \u2013 the two points that I just made are the main factors for the quarter.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, and is it safe to assume the duration really hasn't changed much in that securities portfolio?","Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, it has not changed materially. There has certainly been no material change in our philosophy there, Gerard. So again, it will fluctuate up and down in any given quarter but I wouldn't \u2013 we invest through the cycle, no change in philosophy.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Then, Jay, obviously on your Investor Day you guys have given us the data to support a number of your number one rankings in the businesses you're in, whether it's in the middle market \u2013 middle office outsourcing or U.S. mutual fund accounting. A number of number one rankings. Then since the beginning of 2014, if our calculations are right, it looks like you've won about over $2.5 trillion of assets under custody new business. Then I go to your slide four in today's slide deck, which is a great slide, and I look at the servicing fees from the middle of 2014 through today and there's been no growth. Can you share with us what's going on with that business? Again, considering you're doing so well in winning new business, you're a dominant player, what's causing it not to grow?","Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, I would say you've got to decompose the components, Gerard, and I would say your lead-in was completely accurate and appropriate, in that we are, I would say, disproportionately winning our share of the new business in the marketplace. And whether it's number one in ETFs, where we have close to a 70% share or U.S. mutual funds, where I referenced the offshore domiciles of Luxembourg and Dublin, on and on.","What \u2013 the other things that move the needle on that service fee line would be flows and over the period of time that you've referenced, there have been outward flows in some higher yielding products like mutual funds, upward flows in ETFs. You have seen a retrenchment generally from emerging markets which have higher versus lower fees when you get to more traditional asset classes. So, I would say the effect of markets flows and new business are the ingredients which drive that line. And the part I'm most confident about is the new business, the flows we really don't control, but when they move from higher-yielding fee categories to lower-yielding and when they move from products that might be higher revenue products to lower revenue products, we don't influence that, and obviously the markets.","So, I would say we think long-term that we are best positioned in those markets that will continue to grow. Things fluctuate over periods of quarters and years. But for us it's making sure that we continue to position against the most attractive clients in the segment and the most attractive segments and making sure that consistent with the Investor Day, that we're keeping our expenses in line, so that we can maintain our margin. And as the environment becomes more favorable for some of those products that I referenced, then we would assume that that would flow to the bottom line. We take a long view.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

As such, we expect to hold our fourth quarter earnings call on Wednesday, January 25, 2017.","Now, let me turn it over to Jay.","Joseph Hooley","Thanks, Anthony. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our performance in 3Q '16 and our ability to deliver positive fee operating leverage for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Our results reflect continued momentum in fee revenue and our ongoing commitment to expense management. Our new business results remain strong with $1.3 trillion in new assets servicing commitments year-to-date including $212 billion in the third quarter.","We're making good progress in the implementation of State Street Beacon, our multi-year program to digitize our business, deliver significant value and innovation for our clients and lower expenses across the organization. Importantly, through the execution of State Street Beacon we are differentiating our capabilities by providing enhanced analytics and insights to our clients to help manage their enterprise data and enhance their operational performance and risk management. The integration of our recent acquisition of GE Asset Management is going well with over 260 employees successfully on-boarded and client retention exceeding our objectives. This acquisition extends SSGA's core investment management and alternatives capabilities, and enhances the value add solutions to our clients.","I'll turn your attention to Slide number 5 to highlight our continued progress against our 2016 strategic priorities. We continue to advance our objective to become a digital leader in financial services to execution of State Street Beacon. Throughout the third quarter of 2016 we continue to improve client service and advanced our goal of creating a digitally enabled platform to improve the breath of product offerings and efficiency. Our platform is providing data quicker, better and with more transparency than ever before. For example, we have delivered a number of new solutions including net asset value oversight, creating more line of sight into the composition of a fund's net asset value at the end of the day, and enhanced asset owner strategy providing support to asset onus as they in-source asset management in enterprise pricing web which prices our clients' funds faster than ever before.","We also have a solution to meet the new SEC modernization rules that were finalized early in October, and we are already seeing strong interest from our clients. In terms of driving growth from our core franchise, we continue to achieve strong asset servicing wins with approximately $212 billion in the quarter. Our new business is yet to be installed at quarter-end; it was just over $500 billion. An example of our efforts to build on existing relationships is that we were recently appointed by our long-standing client PIMCO to provide investment manager services outsourcing in support of $1.55 trillion in assets. Separately and a mandate that we have one pending final contract negotiations, PIMCO has selected State Street to provide accounting custody, fund administration, and transfer agency services for an additional $140 billion in offshore funds which is a high growth market segment.","State Street's industry leading offshore fund services business, an operating platform with key considerations and PIMCO's decision to consolidate their business with State Street. In our asset management business, we continue to generate new business in our higher yielding product lines with $12 billion in 3Q '16 ETF net inflows. We did experience overall outflows of $36 billion during the quarter, driven primarily by reductions of the cash invested in securities lending, and also money market reform making prime funds less appealing for certain investors, as well as institutional net outflows. Importantly, these outflows were primarily in our lower-based fee institutional products.","Separately, our State Street Global Exchange Group recently launched State Street Media Stats, a quantitative investment insights tool that draws from digital media and other large consumer data sets. This platform allows clients to quickly and efficiently collect large volumes of data, analyze it, and assess impact on the price risk and liquidity of individual assets. We have now achieved positive fee operating leverage for the first three quarters of 2016 relative to the same period of 2015. State Street Beacon has been a key factor in this progress and is ahead of our original schedule for 2016. We now expect to generate at least $165 million in estimated annual pre-tax expense savings in 2016 with a full effect felt in 2017.","Returning capital to our shareholders remains a strong priority and we declared quarterly common stock dividends per share of $0.38 in 3Q '16, an increase of 12% over 2Q '16. We also bought back $325 million in common stock. We are focusing our attention and efforts on these strategic priorities which we expect will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective to generate positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015. And we would also like to let you know that in line with many of our peers that we will not be hosting in Investor Day in 2017 given our focus on executing our multi-year strategy that we laid out during our 2016 Investor Day. We expect to provide a detailed update at our 2018 event and of course we'll provide updates on progress as we always do each quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to note our announcement in September of the appointment of our new CFO; Eric Aboaf. Eric will join us in mid-December. He served as the CFO at Citizens and prior to that spent a dozen years at Citi, including the last six as Treasurer. Eric brings a wide range of expertise in global banking regulation, treasury, and finance to the role of CFO which he will assume in March of 2017. We truly appreciate Mike's hard work and efforts through the transition and he will continue to be our CFO through the end of 2016 fiscal reporting. We look forward to having Eric join the team to further execute the finance and treasury initiatives in support of our strategic priorities.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the third quarter, and then we'll both be available to take your questions. Mike?","Michael Bell","Thank you, Jay, and good morning everyone. This morning before I start my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to note that our GAAP basis results for the third quarter include two notable items; first, on July 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of GE asset management. Third quarter results included estimated revenue of $65 million, estimated ordinary business expenses of $57 million and approximately $29 million of acquisition-related costs. Second, we reported a pre-tax charge of approximately $42 million related to previously disclosed investigations by U.S. governmental agencies concerning our U.K. transition management business in 2010 and 2011.","Now refer to Slide 6 in the slide presentation for a discussion of our operating basis results for 3Q '16 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 which I'll refer to as year-to-date. 3Q '16 results reflect continued success managing our expenses and generating fee revenue growth. Operating basis EPS for 3Q '16 increased to $1.35 per share from $1.15 in 3Q '15 and decreased from 2Q '16 which included the benefit from seasonality associated with securities finance. Year-to-date EPS increased 3% compared to the same period a year ago driven by a decrease in expenses and additional share repurchases.","Notably 3Q '16 pre-tax margin increased 190 basis points to 30.7% from 28.8% in the year ago period primarily reflecting strong expense management, particularly the continued execution of State Street Beacon, our multi-year program to create cost efficiencies and to digitize our business. On the capital front, in 3Q '16 we declared a common stock dividend of $0.38 a share representing an increase of 12%, and we purchased $325 million of our common stock.","Moving to Slide 7, we're pleased to achieve significant positive fee operating leverage in 3Q '16 compared to 3Q '15. In addition, as you can see on Slide 8, continued progress in managing expenses has resulted in slight year-to-date positive fee operating leverage compared to the year ago period.","Now turn to Slide 9 for review of our 3Q '16 operating basis revenues; servicing fees increased from the year ago quarter and from 2Q '16 primarily due to net new business. Measurement fees increased from 3Q '15 and 2Q '16 primarily reflecting the contribution from the GE asset management acquisition. Foreign exchange revenue decreased from 3Q '15, primarily due to lower volatility and client-related volumes. Securities finance revenue increased from 3Q '15 primarily reflecting growth in enhanced custody and higher spreads in our agency business. Processing fees and other revenue increase from 3Q '15 due to higher revenue associated with tax evasion investments.","Moving to Slide 10, net interest revenue decrease from 2Q '16 primarily reflecting lower investment portfolio yields, a temporary increase in wholesale funding in 3Q '16 and small number of discrete security prepayments in 2Q '16.","Now let's turn to Slide 11 to review 3Q '16 operating basis expenses. Notably expense control continued in 3Q '16, primarily reflecting strong progress for our State Street Beacon program and effective management of our other operating expenses. Excluding the impact from GE asset management, total operating basis expenses decreased from the year-ago quarter driven by Beacon-related savings and a significant reduction in professional services costs, partially offset by higher regulatory expenses and cost of supporting our business.","And then move to Slide 13 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remained strong which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to June 30, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased under the fully faced in standardized and advanced approach, primarily driven by lower risk weighted assets, partially offset by the acquisition of GE asset management. The September 30 fully phased in supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation and at the bank decreased modestly, primarily due to the GE asset management acquisition. We repurchased $325 million of common stock in 3Q '16 and our common stock purchase program announced in July of 2016.","Moving on to the next slide, I'll briefly discuss our recently completed acquisition of GE asset management. The acquisition of GE asset management supports our plan to allocate capital to higher growth and return businesses. In 3Q '16 GE asset management contributed $65 million in estimated operating basis revenue and $57 million in estimated operating basis expenses. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2016. We expect 4Q '16 fee revenue and expenses from the acquired business to be similar to 3Q '16 levels. Importantly, as the integration progresses we expect further revenue growth and expense synergies in the first half of 2017.","Moving to Slide 15, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook. Please note that all of my comments relating to 4Q '16 and full year 2016 outlook exclude the impact from the acquisition of GE asset management. 3Q '16 results reflected strong expense management, as well as fee revenue growth. We expect 4Q '16 results to support our target to achieve positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015 assuming current market conditions. We now expect operating basis fee revenue growth for full year 2016 to be approximately flat versus full year 2015. We expect full year 2016 operating basis expenses to be slightly lower relative to full year 2015; and 4Q '16 operating basis expenses to be slightly higher than 3Q '16 as we increase investments in State Street Beacon and are expected to incur regulatory related expenses.","Importantly, we now expect to deliver through the execution of State Street Beacon, at least a $165 million in estimated annual pre-tax savings for full year 2016.","Moving on to net interest revenue; we expect 4Q '16 operating basis NIR to be slightly lower than 3Q '16. And for full year NIR to exceed the high-end of our prior full year 2016 static scenario of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion.","In summary, we're pleased as the third quarter positions us well to achieve our 2016 financial objectives.","And now, let me turn the call back over to Jay.","Joseph Hooley","Thanks, Mike. And Amy, we're now available for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","First question is, is the 165 up from 140 for the full year. Should we think of that as a pull-forward of 2017 Beacon-related costs or is that incremental cost found throughout the process?","Michael Bell","Glenn, I would characterize it is a general acceleration in savings, I mean we're still targeting $550 million for the total program but importantly, the $125 billion of savings that we expect for 2017 has not changed. So I really think of it as an overall acceleration, probably some '18 and '19 savings coming into '17 and then some of the '17 savings coming into '16. But importantly at this point, we haven't changed the 550.","Glenn Schorr","No problem, we'll still take it. And then in terms of the -- just a lot of moving parts here, so any color would be great. You have decent asset under custody growth but the servicing fee was up 1%. Can we talk about the dynamics of the asset, the type of business you're at because you're winning new business but what's rolling off and what kind of fee compression we're seeing underneath the covers?","Joseph Hooley","Yes, let me start that one Glenn. So you're right, the AUC quarter-to-quarter was up pretty nicely, the service fees are up 1%. I'd encourage you not to look at just a quarter, I think if you look at full year, we're up 5% which seems kind of in line with our assets over revenue metric that we use. But I'd say in the third quarter specifically, we were -- you had markets mixed, if or down, domestic markets up, the strong dollar pushed back a little bit on service fees. So that's -- as opposed to 1%, if you look three quarters to-date, the 5% I think is probably a better reflection. The business that we're winning as is typically the case is all over the place.","Year-to-date, the EMEA business, largely Europe, has contributed over 50% of the new business wins. Highlighted by -- we talked earlier in the year about the Allianz win and then more recently the PIMCO deal which is a big deal, $140 billion of offshore assets in a place that -- because of Brexit and other things I think will continue to see growth in those offshore domiciles of blocks. And in Dublin, I guess the one other point I might make from a highlight standpoint as you've seen some trail-off in the hedge fund performance, so we've seen some outflows in hedge funds; my view is that that's more likely cyclical, I think performance recently has improved, I suspect the flows may have backed the other way.","But the money is going to go somewhere so we've seen more money move to other alternative categories, private equity, real estate which we view as a positive situation from the standpoint of opportunity. So pretty well balanced globally, little bit more of an emphasis on the U.K., on the European markets given some big deals. And a little bit of mix out of hedge but moving to some of the other alternative asset classes is how I kind of characterize the story.","Glenn Schorr","Great. Between is the 140 PIMCO included in the 212 for the quarter of new wins?","Joseph Hooley","No.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao","Good morning. Jay, did the asset management consolidation has been a theme and you've been active at GE. And it looks like segment margins are moving in the right direction but when you think about the future of the investment franchise, do you think you had the right mix of active passive products or the right European footprint? And would you look to add more capabilities via M&A?","Joseph Hooley","Yes, Ashley, let me -- I would say that the GE acquisition was a big step forward and providing a more diversified and frankly, active oriented asset classes, not only in traditional equities in fixed income but also in the alternative classes. So that was the biggest gap that we had and I think we've nicely filled that gap, you've heard from Mike's commentary that we're off to a good start with GE asset management. I think where we've got a pretty decent balance when you look at our passive which still dominates the AUMs in the active business; increasingly we're investing as we talk about in ETFs and we had a good ETF quarter, not just ETFs but higher revenue yielding ETFs which is I think what drove the 5% year-to-date and the 5% quarter-to-quarter revenue uptick.","Multi-asset class solutions was another category where solutions generally -- but we can combine passive and active strategies to produce outcomes. It was also a good statement in the third quarter, we had good uptick and flows in the multi-asset class. So I don't -- from an asset class coverage standpoint Ashley, I think we're -- there weren't any huge gaps. Again, I think GE is a -- plugs a big gap and we have high expectations that the GE Group who have good track records and a lot of their strategies can be leveraged against the distribution prowess of State Street.","I would say that -- the other last point I would make is that from a geographical standpoint, we're still focused on ETFs in Europe and I would say that's an unfolding story as we build up some of the distribution into the private banks and continue to enhance the product line up but your starting point was the consolidation in the asset management industry and I happen to think that we're probably at -- we're at the beginning of that phase and the end but we feel pretty good with regard to the competencies that we have to compete active, passive and solutions market, globally.","Ashley Serrao","Okay, thanks for all the color there. And Mike can you talk about tactical usage of wholesale funding in 3Q? Just walk us through the puts and takes for your 4Q net interest revenue guidance please?","Michael Bell","Sure. So Ashley first in terms of a wholesale funding, we did expand our use of wholesale funding in 3Q relative to 2Q by approximately $2.5 billion and we did that basically to accelerate some of the CD issuances that we otherwise would have had in 4Q under a normal operating environment, just given all the uncertainty in the turbulence. As a result of our money market reform, we just thought it was prudent to go ahead and essentially advance finance the -- with higher levels of wholesale CDs in the 3Q. And so that cost us obviously some NIR but we expect that to be really relatively temporary because I would expect to get back to normal in 4Q.","So as we think about the role forward from 3Q to 4Q, it really -- Ashley it's mainly the story that we've talked about previously, we -- the portfolio turnover particularly in Europe continues to see maturing securities at higher yields than what we're able to reinvest those funds in at today, and so as a result of that grind in the rates we would expect to see modestly lower NIR in 4Q versus 3Q. There are lot of moving parts in any given -- in a given quarter but those are really the headlines.","Ashley Serrao","Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawkins with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. So just a question on Beacon for next year, I know Glenn touched on it but just to dig a little deeper, initially I think that the profile for cost savings on the program was to show an increase in 2017 versus the savings you initially expected in 2016. Normally when these programs are devised, the second year -- it works out better than the first. Why shouldn't investors believe that that general profile and trajectory would remain intact despite -- and the idea that you had better savings this year would only lead to even better results next year.","Michael Bell","Sure, Brennan, it's Mike. In terms of a Beacon, first off, maybe just stepping back from your question for just a second; I would emphasize -- I really feel like we've done a very good job in terms of project Beacon, not just on the expense side but also some of the improvements that have helped our overall service levels for our clients. So overall, we're feeling really good about the program at this point. In terms of your question specifically around the savings, the net savings in 2017 versus 2016, at this point Brennan we expect that there will be a continued uptick in investments that we're making around Beacon and we believe that those investments will pay-off handsomely in 2018, 2019, 2020; but as a result of accelerating some of the savings into 2016 and given just a track record that we're on right now, we think it's also a good idea to work to accelerate some of the investment so that includes investments in IT, development spending, testing, infrastructure all things that we believe will position us with even more confidence for 2018 and beyond savings.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, great. So in that number and there is a lot going on beneath the surface.","Michael Bell","That's exactly, right.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks, Mike. And then a follow-up, pointing back a little bit, when we think about the pressure that's expected to come to bear on -- particularly for the asset management business, the broker sold active side and your clients therefore deal well. Is there a way that you are adjusting your services or offerings or positioning yourself to provide further and more enhanced support for those clients as they work their way through this significant changed and how can you basically make sure you're well positioned to capitalize on potential opportunities as they come out.","Michael Bell","Yes, Brennan, let me handle this -- handle that question and I'll take in two dimensions. I'll first take it from an asset management dimension which maybe was where you were initially headed but from a fiduciary rule the impact of that on product and distribution, I think it leads to a more model based product and as Jay just recently in last couple weeks announced a distribution agreement with RBC where they are using -- we've got an investment and a robo advisor which will use the robo advisor to provide asset allocation among ETFs sold through the RBC distribution channel. So I think that model which in this case happens to be sponsored by SSGA is one of the things that you'll see going forward given the impact of the fiduciary rule. I think if you flip over to the asset servicing side, the fact that we have invested heavily in the ETF servicing platform to provide a lot of online metrics to not only authorized participants but to distributors position us well as ETFs and other more were quantitative model driven products are packaged in order to satisfy the needs of the fiduciary rule.","I think you could also say and this isn't a direct link, but the work we're doing in Beacon, which has the effect and we're already seeing some of this from a service provider standpoint of giving our clients kind of full transparency into the calculation of net asset values and all the things that result, and end of day pricing for a product, or a group of products. I think it vantage the distributors from a standpoint of being able to pull out -- all that together in a timely manner in order to price products at the end of the day. So, I would say in sum that would be on the servicing side, I think ETF and other quantitative model different products will be a key contributor to how distribution, really how a product evolves to suit the fiduciary rule.","And I think some of the work we're doing in Beacon the speed, the turnaround, the transparency of pricing will also advantage the product manufacturers, who are key clients in order to provide effective packaging of product, to meet the new fiduciary role. ","Brennan Hawken","Great, thanks for all that color. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hi, thanks to morning. might be a little bit of a subtlety but seems like a slight change in your outlook for full year fees, kind of coming in more flattish than modestly higher and you had a really good quarter in aggregate, so I am just wondering is there something that we should be thinking about third the fourth or just -- or some little conservative as built-in given the macro environment. ","Michael Bell ","Yes Ken, its Mike. It's really the latter, a couple things. And again I view these as very minor tweaks as opposed to anything not wholesale, but if I look at the macro environment for a second, the currency impact particularly in the U.K. is a headwind for the rest of the year, as compared to where it was earlier in the year pre-Brexit. So, as an example; the pound based revenue that we have is approximately 8% of our overall revenue, we get some benefit obviously on the expense side of that but the -- if I just focus on the fee revenue the weakness in the pound hurts the translation to it to U.S. dollars. Second, as Jay talked about a minute ago there continues to be some risk off in the environment, and just even looking at some of the mix change for example from the outflows from hedge funds, is a mild headwind for example for the AIS fees. ","And then, I look at the SVP 500 this morning. I think it was at 21.43 and that's off from where it's been, so again can I really view these as tweaks hopefully three months from now we'll look back and say it's it was conservative but that's the that's the base -- the basic thinking.","Ken Usdin","Okay, thanks Mike. And then similar question on the expense side cost came in pretty good again. Can you help us understand how much of that Beacon 1.65 was already in the third quarter run rate as opposed to yet lingering pieces yet to come, and the type of magnitude of third the fourth quarter step up that you're expecting under the surface again, I know you get a little help there on the FX side, so just helping us understand the moving parts there too, thanks. ","Michael Bell ","Sure. No absolutely. So you Ken, first of all on expenses the beacon savings we really have at this point captured the beacon savings that we expect for 2016-run rate. So as an example we expect net investments in fourth quarter of 2016 to exceed the additional savings that will get in in 4Q 2016, now as I talked about earlier we expect those investments to pay-off very well in 2017, 2018, 2019 particularly in 2018, 2019 so we think given our track record. We think that\u2019s very shareholder friendly to make those investments at that level.","Round numbers can -- we\u2019re looking at approximately $10 million of additional investment spending for beacon 4Q versus 3Q. So it's not huge but it's enough to potentially move the needle, and the other piece that just continues to be an area of pressure, is the regulatory expense, particularly the RRP spending to be focused on for the July 1, 2017 submission continues to be material. But I think if we step back from the details in your questions, I would come back to the fact that I think we've done a very good job at managing expenses overall for the full year.","Project Beacon obviously has been a big piece of that but also just clamping down, on all of the areas and we're real pleased to be in a position to say that we expect a full year expenses to be below that, of 2015 XGE.","Ken Usdin","And Mike, just one quick follow up on the last point there, just do you think that's an achievable goal to look forward to again on the operating basis X.G.E type of thing, to try to keep that cost outlook a slightest possible as you look forward.","Michael Bell ","Yes, Ken I think -- First I'd say it's a little bit early to be giving 2017 expectations, but I think it's fair to say to your underlying point that regardless of the environment; expense management is going to be a very, very high priority for us next year. And again as I said I'm in this difficult environment to be able to achieve positive fee operating leverage for the first nine months is a really good -- a really good accomplishment. And next year we've got the Beacon 1.25, we expect to get some additional benefit from replacing the outside consultants with FTE's, which is a positive economic parade's, we will get some extra benefit from that in 2017. We continue to focus on the margin target that we talked about back at the Investor Day of 31% for 2018, and we were really -- we continued to rivet on that. So I would say too early to give you specifics we'll give you more in three months but those are the areas that we're really focused on. ","Ken Usdin","Okay, thanks a lot Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from one of Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell ","Good morning. Maybe you could talk a little bit about in this stress test, you're finding the leverage ratio -- Troll [ph] had a speech where he talked about in the future stress test, maybe proposing keeping market based on assets flat. How could you help with that for you in the stress to be -- It's so easy for us in the outside to see the moving parts inter our quarter, so, is it fair to think that could be a material help in future C-course.","Michael Bell ","Jim, its Mike. First of all a couple things broadly and then come back to your specific question. The first your cruel speech and the in the P.R. that came out that day at this point it is simply a proposed rule, so I think until things get finalized. I wouldn't I overweight them too much, but what you're underline point is an important one. Yes, keeping the balance sheet flat as opposed to the previous Fed modeling which had the balance sheet growing, under the stress scenario is particularly helpful to us, because C-car leverage rather than the risk based ratios, has been our binding constraint historically. So again I don't expect that will be a lot of impact on the next C-car because it sounded like most of the impact would come into play beginning with 2018 C-car, but that's certainly a helpful item and some of the other potential changes, which impact the riskiest capital ratios, again would likely have less impact on us because the Tier 1 leverage has been a binding constraint. But I'd say it's early Jim, it's a positive but it's also it's an early days positive at this point. ","Jim Mitchell ","Okay, fair. Just on an outlook on NIL with a rate hike potentially in December; how should we think about that in fact over the following 12-months, any thoughts?","Joseph Hooley","Sure, Jim. Well first of all, a rate hike if I just isolate on that causal factor first, I would expect a rate hike to be helpful, to be accretive for us. I mean I would expect it will probably keep less of the benefit from the next Fed funds rate hike that we got from the last one, which almost all of it accrued to -- so I think will probably have some modest increase on the liability side for our clients, but I do expect net to be accretive. First of all, it obviously helps us with our foreign [ph] rate securities here in the U.S. It helps us with our loan book; which is mostly floating rate; it helps us with obviously the central bank deposits. And so all of that I would expect to be greater than the impact on the client deposit rates. ","The other piece just to be balanced though, it would likely translate to a little bit higher wholesale CD costs and also our senior debt significant portion of that is floating rate. So it's not all gravy but it would definitely expected to be accretive. Just to be balanced though. That's -- your question was focused on the U.S. As I mentioned earlier we do continued to see the negative impact of the portfolio turnover in Europe, the combination of negative rates, and also depressed spreads because of QE over there. So we want to balance that out and in obviously as we talked beginning in January about 2017 outlook, will get some perspective on that. ","Jim Mitchell","Okay, great thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Jay, maybe if I can ask about middle office business, I mean do you see at this through stage of the game, where we're moving into a more competitive environment for active asset managers. Essentially more outsourcing of net Office asset managers, I guess you could you expect more big contracts coming from large asset managers and it's huge. and then it sounds like Bank of New York is also getting a little bit more aggressive obviously with the TRO-DO [ph] and also on even within their more standardized, if you could sort of differentiate yourself in that space and talk about whether you think just change and the growth outlook and in pricing dynamics in net office.","Joseph Hooley","Sure Brian, let me take that. The short answer is yes, as there is more pressure on returns which translates into more downward pressure on the asset management industry and there's been an acceleration I caught in the last couple of years towards outsourcing more. And some of the deals that we spoke about, being probably the most prominent one is anchored in not only back office but middle office. I would say we've -- we're probably seeing more demand for more comprehensive solutions than I can recall in the past several years, and I think it's a direct result of your comment. So I do see middle office, back office, comprehensive outsourcing deals, transfer agency and more and more coming at us in a bundled way, or even in the form of and I say that PIMCO and Allianz are separate transactions, both reflect consolidation of more work with a single provider.","So I think all that's in play and all that should accrue to our benefit. If I isolate a middle office for a minute, you're familiar with the league tables. We have over 10 trillion in metal office assets that we support on our technology, and like most of the activities that we conduct in the servicing business scale matters. So it was over ten trillion and in scale, we have the ability to drive down unit cost, we have the ability with best disproportionally in our unit in our middle office platform. So I take you back to Beacon, which is as we automate create more straight through processing as we on the back of the middle office, have a data GX aggregation product. The scale should provide a significant advantage for us. I think product for product we compare very favorably from a middle office capability and standpoint, because of the breadth of services that we support.","And I do think and I'm going to this is a pivot if you go from middle office to what the next frontier, it\u2019s who is going to win the data aggregation war. And we've got just short of 10 clients who are committed to us, to allow us to be the data aggregator not just for the information that we hold in our back and middle office, but for all their other custodian activities as well. And to me that ties directly into beacon but the long game here is if you can be the date aggregator you get the preferred look at data and analytics capabilities, we referenced a few in my prepared comments.","A drift on your question, but I think it's a good one which is there is continued and there will be ongoing pressure in the asset management industry, all of which should position us to provide more services, knowing more services but more value added services as we were up to the data aggregation and Global Exchange level. ","Brian Bedell","Okay, that\u2019s actually good follow on. Maybe just one more mid Office and then on the data aggregation and that would be in mid office you mentioned using scale as a competitive advantage. Would you think that would translate into lower pricing for the industry -- you feel you can compete more on price rather than improve the margins in a business that you can question, and the you just mentioned on and on data aggregation and I guess I usually ask you to sort Investor Day about the revenue potential impact for that. So, I don't know if you can give better data if you provide any sort of big picture idea about whether you do think there will be some revenue traction in 2017, from the data aggregation initiative.","Joseph Hooley","Sure. So let me take the first one, first middle office pricing scale effect, margin question. I think that convinced that because of the scale we have, we have lower unit cost to perform in the middle office, we've done a good job of standardizing that. But we don't sell it that way. I mean what we sell is middle office deal is usually transplanting something that's done internally to an outsourced model, so we're selling the value not the price advantage, and I think that people that's that evaluate our middle office they view it against their own in-house capabilities, and they view us making the investment in technology; usually in more contemporary platforms to be a big advantage. So I say the scale of fact is to our advantage. We work hard not to lead with price but yet lead with value and preserve the margins and the point is obvious, but as the asset management industries under pressure, we're feeling that pressure too.","So the ability to differentiate and show collectively how we can provide a more effective, a more efficient model when we combine our customers front office, our middle back etc. is really the way we look at that. With regard to data aggregation and global exchange; I think it's a slow building opportunity, The I'll just pause on data aggregation for a minute, the more you do it the very you get the greater advantage you have which is once we wired together not only our digital back and middle office but we start to wire other custodians back in middle office. There's a huge advantage to somebody bringing business to us, because we've already pre-wired those relationships and so we're making a pretty big investment and what we call data G.X. which is the aggregation layer of information not just for State Street, but for other institutions. ","I think that you've seen some of the media stats and other data, and analytics products that sit on top of that. And I think that's when you really start to see some revenue momentum. So, I'd say it's a slow burn but a steady upward bias on the revenue side and as we get into 2017 we'll see if we can find a way to provide some dimension around that for you. ","Brian Bedell","That would be great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein ","Good morning. I want to follow-up on the asset management, just a couple questions. So, I guess just on GE business, clearly the margins are pretty low. I guess like in a low teen's right now. As you guys think about integrating this business, what are you guess the margins can -- I guess ultimately go to? That\u2019s part a, and I guess part B. I recall when you announced the deal there was a piece of business that hasn't closed as part of the transaction, maybe an update on kind of where that revenue stands and one of the probability of that revenue chunk kind of coming in over the next few quarters as well.","Joseph Hooley","Let me take that, Alex. As you point out that GE Asset Management margins at the beginning are not what we'd like to see and part of the synergy opportunities which is inherent in the deal, and which is late likely to unfold over the next two or three quarters, should get that margin at least up to where SSGA is but we have margin aspirations that far exceed what SSG is today and that's part of -- Part of that mix that leads to the 31% and 33% margin targets out in 2018 and 2020. So I think that at least the first couple of steps that are well-understood and we're well on our way and I have high confidence that what would achieve those synergy opportunities. With regard to the incremental GE business, other GE affiliates that we could bring into the mix, making great progress. Huge and helpful support by GE and I suspect that we will bring most of that incremental opportunity into this next; which is our office and CIO kind of business, which is just makes us bigger and more impactful in that segment.","Alex Blostein ","Yes, make sense. And then Mike, quick question for you on the balance sheet or really around the deposit pricing; you guys have been able to successfully flex from us on last couple quarters, stepping down a little bit, I guess again in 3Q, how much room I guess is there to continue to charge for deposits outside the U.S. because an thinking been helping you guys off on a cost.","Michael Bell","Sure Alex, we'll first appreciate as the kudos and you're absolutely right. I think we've done a very good job of that in 2016 and say a couple things, first this continues to be a work in process and as we look at 2017, as I mentioned earlier on the headwinds that we have overall for NIR is the portfolio turnover particularly in Europe with the negative rates and the very well credit spreads, that the grind is truly material for NIR for 2017. So one of the things that we're looking at is, what can we offset that by additional actions on the liability of pricing side, and I would say at this point we're simply looking at various options not the point at this point, ready to announce some additional actions but that is an area that we're keenly focused on.","And then second, obviously if the ECB cuts further, we have to look harder ourselves at following at least any document that the E.C.B. would make, so early days of this, but this continues to be a huge area focus for us, Alex, both here in Boston as well as our R&M [ph] management team.","Alex Blostein ","All right, thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Hi can you talk about the CFO transition, you're 30% done with Beacon, 70% more to go and you have one CFO passing the baton to another CFO. In the midst of a major restructuring and digitization program, and also I wasn't clear, so Mike, will be leaving December, and then you have a new CFO. Coming in March or just can you explain how that handoff works.","Joseph Hooley","Sure, happy to do that. Mike, first let me talk about the baton handoff. Eric Aboaf joined mid-December, and so, he will observe the year-end close, Mike will be with us through year-end through the close of the 2016 books. And then Mike will transition out, Eric will be on board. I might take this opportunity just to talk just for a minute about Eric's background, I think you know some of it, but he, in his most recent six years with Citi, he was the treasurer of the before that, but like an equivalent period ran the financial planning and analysis part of Citi, and within that also oversaw the custody business. So importantly, he is -- he comes to us not just with the financial expertise but with very direct experience in the asset servicing business. With regard to your opening point Mike the beacon activity, well, Mike certainly reports on it and has some visibility to what it was largely centered in the operating environment.","So Mike Rogers who's the President's Chief Operating Officer is really on point with most of the Beacon activity, some of that would affect the corporate support groups, but it's primarily in the-- asset servicing custody middle office back office, so I would see no blip in transition, and we only hope that Eric with his knowledge of this business might bring a fresh set of eyes and new insights to what more we can do. And I think to an earlier point, and you've seen it this year we started out with a plan for Beacon we accelerate that plan, and nobody here is expecting the sun to shin on the environment, so we are working hard to find new opportunities in order to accelerate beacon, expand beacon and I would hope that Eric would be nothing, but a fresh set of eyes to see what things you might have missed.","Unidentified Analyst","And just one follow up year-to-date pretax operating margin of 29% is flat year over year and it's below some of your peers, and I know your target is 33%, so in simple terms like if you're explaining it, your elevator pitch, why and how can a margin improvement 29% to 33%?","Michael Bell","Mike, it's simply through the probably the execution of a project Beacon, I mean we do expect the expense saves from Project Beacon to drop to the bottom line, and ultimately by the combination of the program in year 2020, to be at that 33%, I would also suggest to you that you have an even earlier milestone to what can\u2019t give that we're focused on the 31% margin in 2018, so they'll be a report card coming up on that Mike, quite a bit sooner.","Joseph Hooley","And let me not lose the opportunity to, I know with, in this -- with this audience in this discussion we tend to focus on the cost effective Beacon, but I can't overstate enough how impactful it is when our clients start to see the impact of better data, better information, they now have transparency into how we make the sausage with regard to the net asset value calculation. When your client start to see the positive impact of this effort, it just energizes everybody to go faster do more, and we've started to see that just in the last couple quarters.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning, a couple questions on the balance sheet, just wanted to understand if you feel like there's any opportunity to be pulling down non-operating deposits from here, or have you done everything that you think you need to do on that side, just thinking about the balance sheet side and how you think it\u2019s going to reject over the next couple quarters.","Michael Bell ","Sure Betsy, its Mike. I think it\u2019s fair to say that particularly with money market reform and the turbulence there, that there is likely to be some upward pressure on non-operational deposit levels in in Q4. Now I feel good is we were back in 2015 we did a really good job at managing that mainly focused on client pricing and really just working with clients to figure out other alternatives for them, but that's an area where you know there's certainly the potential for upward pressure. Beyond that I really would go back to some of the earlier discussion around Europe. I think that's the area that we're also focused on in terms of tighter ability pricing, some of that may also push down excess deposits which would be just fine. But the liability pricing in Europe will also be a high priority for us over the next several months.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, then we obviously had one rate hike, we're expecting another one in the not distant future, as these rates have gone up. Is there anything that you can point to suggest that maybe some of your non- operating deposits should be classified as operating, because you talk us through what the timeframe is and the fact pattern that you need to see in order to do that. I am asking a question with the background of trying to understand if theirs is an opportunity to a potential extent duration the securities book can pick up some that way over the coming quarters. ","Joseph Hooley","Sure. So Betsy, first it's early days but we do have work under way, and really it's an ongoing initiative not a onetime episodic event, to look at and carefully characterize our deposits, as operational or non-operational. I would expect that work will continue through 2017, and at this point I would expect that we'll probably get some benefit as a result of that. This points way too early; I wouldn't try to quantify the NRI benefit for you, or the overall level of deposits but I do think that's an area of the upside opportunity.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, but new change to construction investments at this stage?","Joseph Hooley","Not at this point and certainly no change in philosophy, and if in fact we didn't see the some of the deposits that historically been characterized as non-operational, if we saw them being more sticky then that's something we would certainly look at it at that point time.","Betsy Graseck","All right, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy ","Thank you. Good morning. Jay, can he share with us the -- obviously the GE deal is close now on stage three historically over the years has done acquisitions. What are you seeing in terms of the outlook not asking if you're going to do a deal next quarter, but can you give us some color of what's going on in terms of potential further acquisitions that either in custody or Asset Management. ","Joseph Hooley","Yes, Gerard. I would say we just came through a cycle of three-year strategic planning with the board and acquisitions weren't a big part of that conversation, so I would say that [indiscernible] this is unlikely the little A is more likely. And when I think of places where we could perhaps use little help on, and it's probably more the product side. The two places I land would be an asset management, and not contrary to my earlier point, I think we've got a pretty comprehensive set of capabilities and asset management but if there was a team or there are a couple of narrow gaps in the asset classes, that could be in scope.","And then the other big place that I would talk about potentially growth or expansion through acquisition would be in the business that we call Global Exchange, which I referenced earlier in the data aggregation and the more importantly on top of that, data analytics business or the data analytics opportunities which I think is significant. It is a real battleground for a number of different financial firms. It would be my expectation that we would; if you take data analytics and first and separate those two things the data is the one part, and I think in some respects is the harder part, which is aggregating and providing real time data insights to the front office, but on top of that is analytics; whether it's risk analytics, whether it's some of the things we do with Big Data. ","I could see smallish acquisitions on the data analytics side, which would it take advantage of the data position we have to provide more robust analytics. So those would be the two places that potentially we would be advantaged by smallish acquisitions versus organic development. I don't see in a pure cussedness basis to state the obvious. ","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, if the pure custody and episodic event happened where is some of these large portfolio came up with no interest or you would have to always consider something like that. ","Joseph Hooley","I think that two things I would say; one I think that the regulatory hurdle would be high for the big asset servicing firms, to be further concentrated in the in the custody business. And then I would also say that traditionally whether it was the Deutsche Bank acquisition or IBT or even in Sao Paolo [ph], it filled the gap to reach a Bank in Europe and Tesa [ph] in Italy; and I don't see real gaps, if I look at our geographic coverage. we'd love to be doing more in China or India we\u2019re all over it acquisitions not likely the way to get there. Other than that we're pretty well developed and most of the markets that would be attractive asset servicing markets, and if you look at them -- looked at through a product lines, Gerard, I think if you look at a fall away from beta where we have over 60% share on the ETF servicing to the traditional asset classes to the alternatives. ","Again we're pretty well positioned. Now we think there's a meaningful opportunity in the real estate asset class, which is going to brimming with assets to do more outsourcing there, but so, I just don't see -- I don't see big gaps and I think it would be a high hurdle for a regulatory standpoint.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then shifting to the balance sheet; Mike, I know the securities portfolio to watch your senior secured bank loans as you show on page 12, the $3.5 billion portfolio that you have, can you give us a flavor for where you see that going over the next 12-months, relative to this balance sheet, is a going to grow or stay that size. And second, what do you guys assuming for through the cycle loss rate from that portfolio. ","Michael Bell ","So Gerard, first in terms of the overall loss size; again no change in an overall law philosophy, so I would expect that our leverage loan block would continue to be a relatively small portion of the overall balance sheet, perhaps modest growth from where it is today. We have a yield on that block currently of approximately 3.7%. So it's an attractive book, and at this point we've had and would of very good credit experience there. I feel like we're doing a good job of under-running and managing the credits there. But I really wouldn't put it just point Gerard, a long term expectation out there again, I would expect to beat the overall portfolio averages, given our credit underwriting and our bias towards being at the higher end of the scale, so at this point I wouldn't try to put a long term estimate on it, but it's something that will continue to manage and we're very sensitive to the changes in the credit cycle. ","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you, appreciate the answer.","Operator","Your next question comes Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.","Vivek Juneja ","Hi, I have a couple of question, especially on servicing, I'm going to go back to the first question if I look on page 12 of your supplement. And I look at year-to-date '16 versus year-to-date '15; servicing fees are down 1.1%, sometime to reconcile that with the earlier comment and even if I adjust that for the FX fee revenue, let's assume we give all of that tip to servicing, it's basically flattish year-to-date '16 versus year-to-date '15 and I'm comparing that with your AUCA 3Q '16 versus 3Q '15; it's up 7% and in fact if I do similar rough FX adjustment, probably up 8%. So can you help explain; A) but year-to-date you're down 1.1% in your operating servicing fee revenues; why that application, why such a big gap versus your AUCA?","Michael Bell ","Sure Vivek, its Mike. First of all, a couple things are very important here. Number one, as we talked about earlier, we've seen a challenging change in the business mix here in 2016, relative to 2015. It was talked about this on prior calls. We've seen for example more pressure on emerging markets than what we've seen here in the in the U.S. And so basically the impact of seeing rotation from emerging markets for example, to the developed markets particularly the U.S. is a real negative impact on the ratios that you're looking at there. ","Second, as we talked about earlier we've seen some outflows in terms of hedge funds in particular, not all hedge funds but certainly that's been a negative in terms of our overall AIS revenue, and as we talked about previously our AIS revenue also tends to be a higher unit revenue per asset service, than the other books of businesses. And then on top of that, if you do adjust for the currency and markets, that really is the story; all the more reason that I would strongly suggest you look at the overall margins on the business as opposed to looking at the ratios relative to assets because that the -- all the factors that I just mentioned play havoc with those ratios, particularly if you're looking at it in a short-term period.","Vivek Juneja ","Okay, got it. So it's a higher fee businesses that are really facing more. It's a mix shift there.","Michael Bell ","And importantly, you know, obviously we don't have a crystal ball in the future but as Jay talked about earlier we do expect over the long haul to get some help from things like additional outsourcing opportunities for private equity funds, as well as real estate funds; that would actually help the mix over the over the long-term. In addition, I think it's fair to say that -- over the long-term we think emerging markets is in fact a very good place to be in and ultimately we would expect that the -- we'll see some rotation back there and we'll see some help on the currency side there relative to what has been a challenging environment; certainly caught over the last year.","Vivek Juneja ","Okay, got it. ETF fees could either -- if you will talk a little bit about what you're seeing on EPS pricing as when more talk about so much your competitor is cutting pricing on those?","Joseph Hooley","Yes Vivek, let me take that. This is Jay. There has been and I think that we were part of that the next several quarters ago when adjusted some of the fees and some of our -- I call it commoditized type ETFs. We continue to focus our efforts on introducing ETFs that are more differentiated and therefore have a better revenue characteristics to them. So we don't foresee although we always look at whether or not it makes sense for us to adjust fees in order to gain volume but again this is isn't the more commoditized market. I think they will continue to be put pressure in those commoditized one. Mike, I don't know if we have a ETF yield for the third quarter; the $12 billion ETF?","Michael Bell","I don't have that off my head Jay, we can certainly with IR follow-up on that.","Joseph Hooley","We can get you that, Mike gave you a sense of -- close to 10 basis points would be the yield on the ETF flows in the third quarter, just to give you some sense.","Vivek Juneja ","Great, and that thanks early, is the key driven last quarter or two after you sort of cleaned up the pricing couple of quarter go?","Michael Bell","Yes, I think those -- I think it is fairly sticky other than keep in mind spy which is the big S&P500, it can be -- can act like a trading security, particularly around quarter end. So if I isolate that I would agree with your comment, it's been pretty steady.","Vivek Juneja ","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Just a quick question on the GE deal and potential expenses that you're looking for in the first half of '17? Can you just maybe outline not the number -- I know you won't give that but where you expect to see expenses coming from? I know you mentioned before that there were enough services client already but so I would imagine expenses there is just personnel or where else to be coming from?","Joseph Hooley","Yes, let me start that Brian, and then Mike can jump in. You know I think that if you look at the GE asset management deal, whenever you combine two asset management deals you should expect a fair amount of synergy in the course and the core -- corporate support kind of activities and so that's one big bucket of opportunity. But another would be that while GE brought some capabilities that were not robust at SSGA, namely the alternatives; there were some alternatives at SSGA and maybe more importantly, they also brought a pretty significant fundamental equity and fixed income set of capabilities. And shortly after the announcement we announced a reorganization which brought those groups together; so there is a fair amount of synergy just tied up and when you take your fundamental equity business at SSGA combine it with GE and get synergies off that.","So I would say from the corporate support areas, and also in the different asset classes where -- in many cases SSGA had some capabilities, just not as robust as the GE asset management. Would you add anything to that Mike?","Michael Bell","Yes, the only thing I would add Jay; and Brian, to your question is -- while we haven't given you specific synergy numbers. I would remind you that we funded the GE acquisition through the prep issuance and as a result of expecting that the overall transaction will be -- we expect to be accretive in the first full 12-months beginning of July 1, 2016. You can basically conclude that the earnings contribution we expect from the organization including the synergies that Jay just mentioned would be more than sufficient to pay for the cost of the prep. So that at least gives you a way to size what we're expecting from the expense synergies and the additional revenue that Jay mentioned earlier.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, great. And then just one quick one; I know you mentioned the ops servicing space a couple different times here; here is a source of fee pressure, but are you seeing greater pressure than what the overall industry is with regards to the redemption in the overall performance? I mean it's basically down X percent, are you seeing something a multitude above that?","Joseph Hooley","No, I would say now and probably even a little less, were anchored in some of the bigger, more institutional names; and I say they have weathered the storm a little bit better than the rest of the industries. And we also -- it's a point of view but I think if you look at performance, performance recently has improved and so I suspect this is not a secular but rather a cyclical trend where assets flow in and out.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, great, thanks.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello, thank you for taking the question. On the GE asset management acquisitions, what you talk about that before it sounded like you were expecting a ramp up in expenses and synergies to get started in 4Q and now it sounds like 4Q, the contribution is going to be similar to the third quarter and then the ramp up happens more next year. So I just wondered if there has been any changes the way you're thinking around that timing there?","Michael Bell","Geoff, its Mike. No particular change, we do expect to see some incremental benefit in Q4 from the organizational changes that Jay mentioned a minute ago. The main point here is just to emphasize that we expect the bulk of the expense and revenue synergies to really kick in Q1 of '17.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great, thank you.","Joseph Hooley","Thank you, Amy; and thank you everyone for joining us on the call. We look forward to speaking with you in January when we discuss the fourth quarter results. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

Hooley - State Street Corp.","Thanks, Anthony. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our second quarter results, delivering a record level of quarterly earnings per share that reflect continued strength in global equity markets, as well as momentum in our asset management and asset servicing business. We also, for the first time, exceeded $31 trillion in assets under custody and administration this quarter, fueled by a combination of new business activity and higher equity markets.","In June, we celebrated our 225th anniversary. We're proud to be in a rare category of companies whose success is measured not in years or decades, but in centuries. We've been able to achieve this success by focusing on our clients and on key markets, while delivering new solutions to address our clients' needs. We continue to invest and obtain long-term benefits from Beacon, which is core to the next phase of advancing State Street. We're making progress in digitizing our operations and providing new capabilities and information advantages to our clients.","We continue to prioritize returning capital to our shareholders. In June, our Board of Directors approved a $1.4 billion common stock purchase program following the Federal Reserve's review of our capital plan under its 2017 CCAR process. Our 2017 capital plan also includes an increase of approximately 11% and our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.42 per share starting in the third quarter of 2017.","Now turning to slide number four. I'd like to review our progress on our strategic priorities and some key achievements this quarter. We continued to deliver broad-based growth from our core franchise, with new asset servicing wins of approximately $135 billion for the quarter and our highest levels of assets under custody and administration at quarter end with growth of 12% from the second quarter 2016. Our total new business yet to be installed at quarter end was $370 billion, and our pipeline of new business opportunities remains robust. SSGA finished the quarter with $2.61 trillion in assets under management, a 13% increase from 2Q 2016. The majority of the growth from 2Q 2016 was driven by market appreciation, and 5% of the increase was from the acquired GE Asset Management business, which continues to support growth, including the win of the GE Alstom UK business.","We completed the integration of the acquired GE Asset Management business in the second quarter, which had already turned accretive ahead of schedule in the first quarter. I'm also pleased to say that momentum in our Global Markets business continues. Our FX business, with its distinctive research and breadth of trading platforms, increased its ranking significantly according to Euromoney 2017 FX survey, as we were rated fifth with real money managers and hedge funds globally and that's up from seventh and 11th place, respectively, the year earlier.","This increase in market share is reflected in the 13% growth in FX trading revenue from 2Q 2016. Beacon continues to advance with our investments in technology, next-generation platforms, enhancements to operational performance and connectivity across the enterprise and through the delivery of innovative solutions and insights to our clients. Eric will provide you some more detail on the progress that we're making with Beacon in a few minutes.","We remain focused on providing clients with innovative solutions to address regulatory risk and analytic requirements, their investment needs and supporting the achievement of their growth objectives. Some examples of the benefits of our ongoing investments include solutions for regulatory reporting, risk analytics and collateral management and the broadening and deepening of our OCIO capabilities with the acquisition of GE Asset Management operations.","We've also developed our Market Entry Solutions, which is an integrated value-added service that leverages our global presence and expertise to assist our clients with their global growth strategies. Our mission is to provide clients with information insight, access and partnership to support their global product development and distribution ambitions.","So, in closing, we remain focused on achieving our financial goals as reflected by our year-over-year quarterly positive fee operating leverage of approximately 190 basis points and total operating leverage of over 270 basis points. This resulted in improving our pre-tax operating margin to over 33% for 2Q 2017 and helped us increase EPS 14% from 2Q 2016 and 18% in the first six months compared to 2016, while generating a return on equity of approximately 14% for the quarter and 12% in the first six months of 2017. All of these are on an operating basis.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Eric, who'll cover the financials and then we'll open the call to your questions.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Thank you, Jay, and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide 5 where I will start my review of our operating-basis results for second quarter 2017. EPS for 2Q 2017 increased to $1.67 per share, up 14% from 2Q 2016. 2Q 2017 results reflected continued momentum in fee revenue, driven by higher equity markets, new business wins and positive client flows, as well as growth within our markets businesses. 2Q 2017 results also reflected higher NII as a result of the rising interest rate environment, disciplined liability pricing and improved liability mix.","We delivered approximately 2 percentage points of positive fee operating leverage and achieved a pre-tax margin of over 33%, up almost 2 percentage points. And importantly, ROE also improved to over 13%, up 1.4 percentage points.","Now let me turn to slide six to briefly review growth of two key drivers. First, AUCA increased to record levels of $31 trillion, up 12% from 2Q 2016. Growth was driven by a combination of market appreciation and net new business and client flows. AUCA growth translated into strong revenue increases across our three geographies and spanned a broad range of products and client segments. As compared to 1Q 2017, both AUCA and revenues were up nicely.","Second, at State Street Global Advisors, AUM increased 13% from 2Q 2016, driven by market appreciation and the impact of the acquired GE Asset Management operations and positive ETF flows, which were partially offset by continuing institutional net outflows.","Please turn to slide 7 where I will focus on 2Q 2017 fee revenue results, which were up 9% relative to 2Q 2016. You'll also find detail in the appendix for the sequential quarter comparison. Servicing fees increased 4%, primarily due to higher global equity markets, new business installations and client activity on a year-over-year basis. While our wins were broad-based, we saw particular strength in EMEA, alternatives and middle-office outsourcing for asset managers.","Management fees increased 38%, reflecting the contribution of the acquired GE Asset Management business and higher global equity markets on a year-over-year basis. On a sequential quarter basis, both servicing and management fees demonstrated solid growth, increasing 3 percentage points and 4 percentage points, respectively.","Trading services increased relative to 2Q 2016, primarily reflecting gains in market share and increased activity in emerging markets, offset in part by lower volatility. Securities finance revenue increased from 2Q 2016, reflecting continued strength in enhanced custody.","Processing fees and other revenue decreased from 2Q 2016, primarily reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange swap costs, which are primarily in NII this year. As a reminder, 1Q 2017 processing and other revenue included a $30 million gain related to the sale of BFDS\/IFDS.","Moving to slide 8, NIM was up 16 basis points from 2Q 2016, and NII was up 13% on a relatively flat balance sheet. Strength in NII was the result of higher market interest rates in the U.S., disciplined liability pricing and our continued focus on improving our liability mix, partially offset by a smaller investment portfolio.","On a sequential basis, 2Q 2017 NII benefited from higher market rates as well as lower levels of wholesale CD funding. NIM was up 10 basis points sequentially, a portion of which was non-recurring, so we expect closer to a 3 to 5 basis point uptick in the third quarter, given the June Fed rate increase. Interest-bearing client deposit pay has remained relatively low, within a 20% to 25% range. And even with our disciplined pricing, we did see our deposits tick up sequentially, as clients continue to look for outlets for their U.S. dollar cash.","Now I will turn to slide 9 to review second quarter expenses. 2Q 2017 expenses increased 7% in total from 2Q 2016, with approximately 3 percentage points of that increase related to the $51 million of expenses associated with the acquired GE Asset Management business. Excluding those acquisition-related expenses, compensation, employee benefits increased from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting increased cost to support new business, incentive compensation and merit increases and regulatory initiatives, partially offset by Beacon savings.","Information systems, transaction processing and occupancy costs increased modestly year-over-year and in line with new business and planned investments. Other expenses increased, primarily reflecting the costs associated with the acquired GE Asset Management business and higher regulatory and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower legal-related costs. 2Q 2017 GAAP results also included a pre-tax $62 million charge related to the restructuring associated with Beacon, which will provide benefits within the next five to six quarters.","As compared to 1Q 2017, expenses decreased 5 percentage points, reflecting the 1Q 2017 seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense. Excluding this seasonal impact, sequential expenses increased 3 percentage points, reflecting net new business, merit increases and the timing of incentive compensation awards, partially offset by savings related to State Street Beacon.","Let me now move to slides 10 and 11 to review our progress on State Street Beacon, as well as highlight the range of initiatives that enhance the client experience and increase operational efficiencies. Starting on slide 10, you can see four tangible benefits that are improving the client experience. First, we are leveraging our global scale to improve the speed and efficiency of key services, transaction processing, fund accounting and fund administration. Each of these three services has a detailed set of metrics that we track, a subset of which you can see on the right side of the slide. In particular, we are seeing strong benefits as we roll out and clients adopt our new technologies and tools.","Second, we are upgrading our core platform architecture, integrating with new technologies and investing in IT capabilities. Third, we have made good progress expanding Beacon across the organization. Earlier this year, we launched effectiveness and efficiency initiatives in the corporate function and in SSGA, while we also centralized our procurement and real estate processes.","Lastly, on the revenue side, we expect the development of innovative client business solutions, such as our recently-launched SEC Modernization product to result in incremental revenue, some of which we are already seeing in our sales pipeline.","Turning to slide 11; Beacon remains on track to achieve $550 million in targeted program savings, including at least $140 million in 2017. On the left side of the slide, we show the year-over-year growth benefits and investment expense related to Beacon. You can see on the bottom row our previously-disclosed 2016 net savings, as well as our 2017 guidance to achieve at least $140 million. Each quarter, we carefully pace the level of investments to consider multiyear initiatives, support immediate opportunities and calibrate this to the external environment. The net benefit varies each quarter, and in 2Q 2017, we recognized approximately $25 million in year-over-year net expense savings.","On the right side of the slide, we have broken out the growth savings by major categories that I just described. Approximately 70% of the projected growth savings in 2017 is a result of leveraging our scale and dispersing resources across our global platform. The balance comes from improving our technology and expanding Beacon deeper into the organization. Each year, the mix of benefits will change up or down as we identify opportunities for improvement.","Now let's turn to slide 12 to review our balance sheet and capital position. We continue to maintain a high-quality balance sheet, including an investment portfolio with a well-structured and diversified mix of securities. Our capital and liquidity position remains strong. We repurchased $227 million of common stock in 2Q 2017, which completed our repurchase under our program announced in July of 2016.","Our new capital actions announced just last month continue to demonstrate our commitment to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and higher dividends. While we were relatively pleased with our CCAR results, we are obviously digesting the detail as are other banks.","We will carefully operate and optimize under the current rule. And of course, we are monitoring for potential developments. Let me briefly update you on LCR reporting requirements. We will begin to report our quarterly average LCR in August. On an average daily basis for 2Q 2017, our LCR is above the 100% standard as you'd expect.","Moving to slide 13, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook. In summary, we are very pleased with the year-to-date progress against our original 2017 outlook. Importantly, in 2Q 2017, we saw good revenue momentum; we continued to deliver a good operating leverage and our pre-tax margin expanded nicely. We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders, prudently managing expenses and executing on State Street Beacon, while driving growth in our core franchise.","So based on the strong year-to-date results, let me provide an update to our 2017 outlook relative to 2016. First, we now expect fee revenue growth for the full year to be in the 6% to 7% range, assuming the present favorable market conditions continue to prevail throughout the remainder of the year and the U.S. dollar remains stable relative to major currencies.","Second, we expect fee operating leverage to be towards the upper end of the 100 basis point to 200 basis point range that we communicated in January. On the expense front, we will continue to calibrate expenses against the revenue backdrop, but also in light of client installation requirements.","Third, due to strong year-to-date NII performance, we expect 2017 NII to be within a range of $2.43 billion to $2.45 billion or an increase of approximately 12% to 13% from 2016 levels. Lastly, we continue to expect our tax rate to be at the lower end of the 30% to 32% target we communicated in January.","Let me briefly touch on third quarter 2017 before turning the call back to Jay. We expect trading services revenue to be muted as activity usually slows in the summer, while securities finance revenue should decrease from the elevated seasonal levels experienced in 2Q. We expect NII to increase in 3Q 2017 due to the Fed's most recent move at the end of June, but not at the same magnitude as we saw from 1Q to 2Q. In summary, we believe we are well positioned to achieve these full-year 2017 financial objectives.","Now, let me turn the call back to Jay.","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Thanks, Eric. Victoria, we now like you to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, how are you?","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Good morning.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","So the fee growth is great, even if you ex-out the GE acquisition. So it feels like there's a little bit better leverage to equity markets than the whole 10%, 2% rule of old. But I don't know if you could help with how much of that is just emerging market versus developed market growth and the fee differential there? I don't know if you've ever shared with us what the fee differential is, but good to see, nonetheless.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Glenn, it's Eric. Good question and let me give you the summary. It's really all of those elements, right? So you remember equity markets are up nicely in the low teens. Bond markets on the other hand are actually flat to down. In some cases, hedge funds markets, private equity are kind of mixed. So you kind of have to factor all that as you think about the AUCA growth. I think what we did see was actually a nice mix, both on the AUCA front in terms of growth and on the fee \u2013 services fee area in terms of growth. We saw a nice mix of some support from market appreciation, some nice contributions from flows. We've seen flows broadly distributed this quarter and this \u2013 for the first half of the year across Europe, U.S. mutual funds, ETFs, right, all those are flowing in positively given our clients and the market.","And then net new business has been good. You see we continue to have wins in the marketplace. We still have a pipeline that we've been carrying that's $350 billion, $370 billion, $375 billion over the last couple of quarters, and that's getting implemented literally month-by-month. So it's really a combination of all the factors you described.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","And is there a large fee differential EM versus developed markets? Or does that get bundled into a global client all-in fee?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","More and more it's bundled as a global client, right? We have clients that operate around the world. The fee discussions capture all their businesses. You have some differential between lower-volume emerging markets, but even those are more typically in the \u2013 are quite advanced economies these days, slightly different fee levels at bonds versus equities, ETFs versus mutual funds. I mean, there's a dispersion but I don't think it's as dramatic as it once was.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Appreciate that. The last little one on balance sheet, you alluded to but I look for a little more color. The rate paid on non-U.S. deposits went negative from positive, small numbers but went negative from positive, yet those deposits actually still grow. I'm just curious if you can give us a little more color on what drives that? Obviously, that's what you're talking about on your pricing discipline.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yes. I think the \u2013 probably the best page to take a look at for folks is the supplemental information package, the page 13 where you see the average interest-earning balance sheet. I think you saw a couple of things. I think the international deposits, remember, have a component of swaps that are tagged against those that feature into NII, and so that's why you see the lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter. We actually pushed our international deposit pricing down a bp or two, just given the \u2013 our need to earn appropriate returns internationally, and also because we continue to see a nice inflow and willingness, almost the need from our clients to leave balances with us. They're doing that in euros, in sterling, in yen. They're doing that in dollars. And so, we've got high demand on, I think, for clients to leave cash with banks. They're \u2013 a lot of that, they're steering towards us, and we obviously have a limited capability to accept too much of that given the leverage ratio constraints that we need to keep in mind.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","All right. Thank you for all that, Eric.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. A couple of questions, I guess, in some of the buckets that they were particularly strong this quarter, and wanted to start, I guess, with the security lending. So nice uplift, it feel like seasonality has been softening over the last couple of years. So maybe, as you look at the sequential change, can you help us understand kind of what was the seasonal uplift this time around versus more kind of normal growth? And then, I guess, the more important question is, enhanced custody obviously continues to contribute here. Where do you guys still see the runway in that business, which, I guess, continues to be pretty strong?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yeah. Alex, it's Eric. Let me start. I think, as you described, seasonality and traditional SEC lending a little lighter than it's been historically, but we've still seen a decent amount of seasonality. Part of that just might be where we are in the market cycle. Part of that is there's the usual dividend activity and so forth that you'd expect.","On the enhanced custody side, I think, there we're actually seeing a continued pattern beyond seasonality of growth in revenues. Part of that is, we're serving more clients. Part of that is, we're going a little deeper with select clients. And so that \u2013 on \u2013 and that business was really a mix of both seasonality and growth on a year-over-year basis.","And so, I think, you can kind of take a look at the year-on-year comparisons. That's a good proxy for a growth of the two businesses. The quarterly uptick, a little more seasonal. But we also have to remember, right, there's volatility in these businesses, they ebb and flow. And so, with a very strong quarter, we're quite pleased, but it will move up and down, and I think we all need to factor that in.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Sure. And then, just as far as some of the excitement around capital relief on the back of the treasury white paper. I'm sure you guys got a bunch of question on that, but with Tier 1 leverage being obviously the more binding constraint for you guys in CCAR, what is the latest that you guys hear in terms of the ratio being augmented to kind of calibrate closer to what SLR could potentially change to or just making broader adjustments to CCAR that would alleviate against some of the pressure points there. And I guess, if any of those things do happen, how should we think about the kind of newfound capital that you guys could either grow the balance sheet or return to shareholders?","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Let me start that one, Alex. This is Jay. The \u2013 I thought the treasury report I'm sure everybody's gone through it by now was a pretty balanced report with regard to ways to recalibrate and fine-tune some of the Dodd-Frank and Volcker legislations. So, I think, it was a good framework. And hopefully, once we get some of these appointments with the Fed and other agencies, they'll start to attack that.","For us, we have a pretty narrow set of concerns and issues. The most prominent one is the one you mentioned, which is the drag that excess deposits have on the leverage ratio. And that is prominent, not only in that report, but in all the conversations that I have with regulators. Everybody, I would say, acknowledges that, that was an unintended consequence of the regulations. So I think there's a real desire to fix it. The fix, the conversation around a fix is kind of two dimensional. One way to adjust the excess deposit issue for the trust banks would be simply to rescale the leverage ratio and that's one of the conversations out there so that you'd give the custody banks a little bit more headroom to accept these deposits. And at the same time, put in place some kind of a provision so that in a crisis or in a market event that we get relief from the leverage ratio. So that's one kind of conversation, which would tend to just deal with the trust bank issues of the leverage ratio.","And then the broader thought out there is to reduce the denominator of the leverage ratio to accommodate central bank deposits, and that's, remember, that Bank of England took that approach in their leverage ratio. I'd say, and obviously that would treat not only the trust banks but the other, the rest of the banking industry as well. Those are the two paths that are being discussed. I think it's going to depend on, again, new appointments and getting people in place and figuring out what the best way to deal with it is. But I have very high confidence. I can't tell you when that the issue will be addressed because I think it's acknowledged in all circles that it was an unintended consequence of the regulations.","With regard to the broader regulatory reform agenda, as I say, our needs, our issues are narrow. I think more broadly though if we get to extended cycles on the resolution and recovery plan, if in CCAR, they held the balance sheet flat, all that would be additive to not only the cost of complying with regulation, but as you rightly mentioned, freeing up capital within State Street. Eric, I don't know if you'd add anything to that.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yes, I think we're quite pleased to just see some balanced discussions and reports coming out of Washington. We think even Governor Tarullo, as he wound up his tenure, I think was supportive of some of these changes, which are really in the bucket of unintended consequences that have come through. Jay covered several of them. Another one is on the Volcker rule. The Volcker rule in an unintended way captures the seeding of new mutual funds and other types of investments that an asset manager has and if that asset manager is held within a bank environment like our SSGA business, it's kind of, you're guilty until proven innocent that it's not propped trading when in fact, all you're doing is seeding a new investment or a new mutual fund. So we're optimistic that at multiple levels, there is an evolution here. We're certainly engaging with folks at multiple levels just to help articulate how to move the pendulum in a prudent way that gets us to where we should be.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Great. Appreciate you guys taking the questions.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. First question just on the operating fee leverage guidance, you're still calling for 100 to 200, and it looks like inclusive of SGA, it's more like more like 320s through the first half. So can you just talk us through, either what do you expect to change in that relationship in the second half? Or are you just continuing to have a conservative guide given always the uncertainty of the environment?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Ken, it's Eric. The answer is really the second part of that, of your question, which is we've got to be conservative, right. A year-and-a-half ago, no one thought the equity markets would swoon like they did, and that is always a risk notwithstanding the indices like VIX and so forth, are at all-time's low. But we know when things feel good is when you should be vigilant.","I think we're also just trying to be conscious that as we have revenues, we also have an installation pipeline, as we have new wins that we're carrying that pipeline through. And part of what you're seeing us do is we actually have to start to onboard new clients, put people against that build-out infrastructure and technology to plug them in. And so, part of what we are trying to signal is, we absolutely will calibrate operating leverage in the 100 to 200 basis point range.","We'd certainly \u2013 we've hinted that \u2013 or more than hinted, we'd like to be towards the upper end there, but we're mindful that, that the installation of those clients, especially those global clients who are particularly complex and have a broader set of offerings, take some energy and some spending. So we'll be disciplined here. I think we're very pleased with the first half, but we don't have any interest in resting on our laurels. And we know we need to maintain a pattern, a consistent pattern of positive operating leverage.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Okay. And then secondly, if I could just dive one depth further into the liability cost side. Can you just help us go that extra mile on the U.S. deposit cost? You mentioned the wholesale funding. How much of that was a helper from 50 basis points to go to 38%? And then on that non-U.S. side, can you help us understand the delta in the hedge, the $25 million last quarter, and what that went to this quarter? Thanks again, Eric.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yeah. Let me do this at a couple levels to help answer your questions. So first, if you think about the 10 basis point uptick that we saw, I'd say 4 or 5 basis points of that this quarter was really market levels floating up, deposits which re-prices the asset side of the balance sheet, offset with disciplined pricing across both the U.S. and the international jurisdictions. So we saw good performance there.","We then saw couple basis point tick down from, as we rolled off some of those wholesale CDs that I mentioned. And then there was a couple of basis points just from market dislocations. We saw the swap costs were a little lower this quarter than previously. That moves around with markets. It moves around with which currencies we're swapping. And so we had a little more of a tailwind than we would have expected. So those are the combinations.","I think if you had decomposed the deposits, on a tactical basis, total U.S. deposit costs were down 12 basis points. The underlying is that the CDs drove actually a bit more than that, kind of 15 basis point, 16 basis point roll down, and U. S. deposit costs were up by just four. And when you compare that to a 25 basis points move of the Fed, that's a 20% deposit beta, which is kind of the zone we've been in. We've been signaling 20% to 25%. I think it's coming at the lower end of our range. On the international deposits, I did say earlier the underlying international deposits actually fell by a basis point in terms of cost. The rest of the movement is in the swap, the furnishing swap costs, which we've actually enumerated in the footnotes of page 13 back there if you want to just do the math.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Perfect, yes. Thanks for the color, Eric.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Hi, Betsy, go ahead.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Can you hear me?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yes.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right, great. I just had a couple of follow-up questions. One was on, Eric, the LCR. You mentioned that starting in August regulatory reports are going to require that you disclose the LCR ratio in a composition, Eric. Could you just give us a sense as to what you've done to manage your position going into this announcement? And how you think about managing it as you're going to be disclosing this on a quarterly basis? And what you would recommend folks like us think about or look at as the numbers come out?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Sure. I think the demand on the LCR has certainly predated me. The team two, almost three years ago when the LCR kind of came of age and got finalized did a couple of things to drive compliance. First, we added some deposits to our underlying balance sheet, right, and some of that was in the form of wholesale CDs. And we did that because we needed that term structured that extended beyond the 30 days, 60 days, 90 days that you want to be at. I think secondly, the team then did some very good work to itemize their deposits and create clarity on which ones were operating versus excess and actually balance \u2013 rebalance that mix. And you saw the reduction almost two years ago, deposits of about $20 billion, $25 billion.","And that was really driving out excess deposits but actually keeping or actually increasing over time those operating transactional deposit balances. And then what you've seen us do over time is we've continued that mix improvement, right, under the surface so that their operating deposits continue to trend upward. And that's given us the luxury to actually work down some of those wholesale CDs. So I think there has been a program in place here over a two to three-year timeframe to actually prepare. I think we feel like we've now been operating under the LCR rules for kind of three years, but the last year has been really on a BAU basis. And so I don't think it's going to change a lot of our management going forward. Those are the rules. The rules are the rules, and they're there for a good reason and we'll operate within them.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So is there anything left in non-operating to wind down here?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Nothing that's terribly significant. There's always a little bit, and there's always an ongoing optimization that you do. We have a decent-sized alternatives accounting and fund administration business. That's with financial counterparties like hedge funds or private equity. And the Fed has deemed that as a 100% access. So we don't think that's right. We don't think the model support that, but \u2013 so we need to keep some amount of access for those clients and we'll do that. But there's no big step change that we expect.","And in truth, the best thing to do from an LCR management standpoint is now to operate with a healthy LCR. But you don't want it to be neither too thin, nor to rich, right? If it's too rich, you're leaving money on the table and you can redeploy that into lending or securities. If it's too light, you're scraping by. And so I think there's a nice middle ground that we'd want to operate in.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then just lastly, on the guidance that you have for the NII for the full year, obviously part of that uplift is this quarter, and it looks like there's a bit of an uplift also from 3Q, 4Q, but maybe at a slower pace than 2Q's uplift. And my question is that just a function of being a little bit more conservative on the cost of funding given that some of the benefit this quarter came from what looks like swap market activity that maybe you're baking into the base case.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yeah, I think the \u2013 that's the right way to think about it. We had a nice uptick from 4Q to 1Q, another nice uptick 1Q to 2Q. But I think the \u2013 you can't bank on a full 10 basis point sequential uptick, again even with the Fed, the rate rise, we think the underlying core in that 10 might have been 5 basis points, 6 basis points depending on how you count.","Given that we have a little more of that now, we expect 2Q to 3Q uptick to be closer to 3 basis points to 5 basis points because some of it's already in the run rate. And that after that, we have to wait and see. There's been a lot of talk about deposit betas, where they'll go, when will begin to flow it upwards.","That hasn't happened. We've had nice stability in our deposit betas. We've had nice stability in our deposit base, but I don't think any of us with bankers want to get out ahead of ourselves and predict what \u2013 exactly what they'll look like in 4Q and then into next year just yet.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Super. Thank you so much. Really appreciate the color.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Let me just circle back on the NII outlook. What are your assumptions for \u2013 specifically for the rate backdrop in the second half in terms of Fed hikes and the tenure? And then I assume that you're still assuming like around a 25% deposit beta in the second half as well?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Brian, it's Eric. That's about right. So we've been at the 20% to 25% right now. We think that for this June hike, we'll be around that level, but you never know for sure. We expect the June rate hike to come through, and then potentially a December hike. But since it's so late in the year, that really won't have much of an effect on 4Q. So that's our interest rate forecast.","I guess, what I would say is, if you step back, so far, deposits have performed well, I think, in this rising rate environment. I think part of that is that we remix the quality of the deposits and pushed out a lot of that access two years ago, and then we've been managing carefully over the last year to support that. And then partly because the deposits from the custody banks I think actually respond in a decent way. If you think about it, there's a hierarchy of response in deposits across different sectors, right? We all know that in retail, you have quite low deposit betas, and that's been shown for cycle after cycle. I think at the other book end in the corporate sector where you get corporate treasurers, they're actually quite willing to shop their money, especially because they keep them for cash management and earnings credit. They'll move that around. They are borrowing from banks, and they're quid pro quo sometimes is, hey, you've got to pay up on deposits.","So I think the corporate sector and even high net worth tends to have a higher betas. And we're in the middle as a custody bank, right? We're doing with end-of-day cash, asset managers and pension funds who want to cover their transaction flows, who aren't really tempted to drawdown lines, right? That's not something that they look to do. And so I think the custody banks are in this middle ground between retail and corporate, and that's part of the reason why our deposits have responded well through the first couple rate hikes.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's great way to characterize it. And then my follow-up question, also sticking with the balance sheet. If you can talk a little bit in more detail about the repurchase agreement financing that you've been doing? Specifically, I'm looking at the securities purchased under resale agreement line that revenue went from $46 million to $69 million in NII. It's about a third or so of your Q-on-Q NII increase and I think over half of your year-on-year NII increase. Can you just talk about how that business is going? How sustainable that is? What are you doing exactly to see that pretty remarkable improvement in revenue?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yes. So that's the \u2013 we detailed that well in the footnote. That's the support of our clients in the FICC repo program. That's a clearinghouse for repo. We arranged those repo trades with clients. These are clients who have surplus cash. What they want is, they want to leave that cash but they want to get securities as collateral, right? So they're looking for a collateralized deposit in effect. We can effectively help them process that through the FICC clearinghouse. The FICC clearinghouse does well over $1 trillion of repo. And you see that we're facilitating on the order of $30 billion, $35 billion for clients. So, this is just part of the support that we have for asset managers and other types of custodial clients. It has been in place for a number of years and we're there facilitating in the marketplace in ways that they appreciate.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Are you growing it based on client adoption of using that service that you're providing? Or do you think more of the growth is driven from the Fed hikes?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","The growth is just \u2013 the volumes are relatively stable. They're up a smidge, but it's \u2013 we do this as an accommodation as part of our business model. The rates are typically reverse repo rates, so those are just floating up in line with market reversed repo rates, general collateral.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a quick one on \u2013 again, on deposits. Sorry, it's the topic du jour here.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Popular.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, yeah, big focus, very active here this quarter. And when we think about non-operating deposits, could you just maybe update your outlook for those? And how fast you might think they could run off in this environment? How much might be like baseline operating need the business as usual type of balance? Thanks.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yeah, Brennan, it's Eric. That's a \u2013 it's a fair question, but it's one where it's hard to answer definitively, right, because we are in a new environment. That said, you've seen \u2013 we've seen some kind of a gentle volatility around the levels that we're at, $42 billion, $43 billion, $44 billion, or $45 billion of non interest-bearing deposits. You've seen it tick up. It's ticked down. Year-over-year, it's flattish actually and quarter-over-quarter, it's down $2 billion.","And the question we're wrestling with, are we beginning to see, and we probably are some transition from non interest-bearing to interest-bearing. But that's been predicted by our treasurers and every other treasurer on The Street. It feels like since the first rate hike, right. And so the $2 billion move, which is less than 5% of the non-interest bearing deposits this quarter, actually is less than what we expected. And so I think there will be some transition over the coming quarters. It's hard to predict how much it is, but it's all factored into our deposit betas.","Remember, you're moving from effectively zero interest-bearing into what might be a stated rate. A stated rate for us as a bank is in the 10 to 15 basis points relative to a 25 basis point Fed hike that quarter. That's actually all factored into our deposit betas.","And in fact, the way we characterize that is our deposit betas for interest-bearing deposits are 20% to 25%. When you factor in all the non interest-bearing deposits, those that are not moving and those that are maybe beginning to transition, the deposit beta in aggregate for total deposits is more like 15%. So it's factored in. I think we expect it to trend downwards, and we're certainly prepared and it's part of our overall outlook.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. That's great. Thank you and your overall outlook actually, I think, includes some reduction in the interest-earning assets, 0% to 5% for the year. When we look at the 2Q balances versus in 4Q average, we're already down about 3% and I think 3.5% roughly. So is that right to imply that you guys expect the pace of decline in interest-earning assets to moderate here in the back half of the year? Thanks.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Brennan, if you can tell me when what will happen with surplus cash in the system, I can give you an answer to that. I think we continue just to see clients look for outlets for their cash, right? That's been happening ever since money market reform. The clients naturally come to their custodial bank to do that and they're doing that around the world. So the balance sheet is down, like you say, a couple of percent year-to-date. If we can hold that level, that would be good. If we can trend down a little more, that obviously gives us the room in the leverage ratio. But at the end of the day, we need to balance both how we want to ideally operate the balance sheet with being responsive to our clients because that's who we're here for.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much for the color.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. A quick question on CCAR. It seemed like you guys were hit by OCI as you moved quite a bit to held to maturity, some of the higher-quality securities to held to maturity didn't offset the potential losses, I guess, elsewhere. Is that going to change the way you approach it going forward, or do you stick with the plan as you have it now?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Jim, it's Eric. Let me give you a little perspective. I think overall, we were pleased with CCAR in the sense that we wanted to take the dividend up 11%. We wanted to return $1.4 billion of capital through buybacks and the review proved supportive of that. So I think we were pleased. I did say in my call text that we continue to look for transparency and try to understand the models because it's multiple models at the Fed. There are credit models that we were trying to make sure we understand. There are PPNR models, right, and sort of different levels of PPNR for different banks and then for different banks within the same kind of cluster or same category. And then like you say, there's the OCI models, which seem to move and create a larger stress than we expected.","I think the first part of our reaction to CCAR is always just to manage our business and balance sheet carefully, right. And I say that in two ways. One is you're always trying to do your best with earnings. You give some of that back to shareholders, but some of that accretes on the balance sheet and you see our capital is up year-to-date.","The second part of that is we're always trying to manage the balance sheet in a tight way. We talked about deposits and the balance sheet being tighter year-to-date. And part of that is because we want to run with a leverage ratio that's got the right levels. And you see that in 4Q 2016 on page 12 of our earnings deck, our leverage ratio was 6.5%. We're now at 7%. And what is that? That's actually the earnings accretion into the capital count as well as the tighter balance sheet, which has gotten us there. So just over the first six months of the year, we got 50 basis points more cushion when it comes to a step off.","So that's where we're at. After that, we're always going to look at the models and ask questions around are there refinements that we could make on our mix of assets, mix of securities, et cetera. But I think you can expect us and every bank to be doing that.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Right. Okay, well, thanks. And any update on the timing and impact from the movement of the custody assets to BlackRock? Thanks.","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Yes, Jim, this is Jay. No, no update. Sometime in 2018, probably an elongated transition would be my best guess.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks guys. First question, just on the foreign exchange and the trading; you guys had a good quarter definitely versus peers and I know the platform is a bit different. But just what was maybe environmental driven versus strategically? It seems like there's more of a focus on growing that business than there has been, and so just over the next year or two years, where do you see that opportunity on that side of the business?","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Sure, Mike, I'll start that. This is Jay. As you point out, we do have a different foreign exchange franchise than some of our peers and that it's pretty broad-based and it's supported by some pretty intriguing research. So I would say that we compete at a different level with regard to foreign exchange.","I referenced in my comment, the Euromoney survey, I don't know if you're familiar with that, but it's the \u2013 kind of the go-to survey in the industry. And we moved up by quite a few paces \u2013 places in that survey, which to me means market share gain. And I think we've got a broad foreign-exchange offering.","We added a number of new clients this quarter, which is not unusual. We to continue to add new clients. Environmentally, I'd say the global and EM trade helps. But I would say generally, gaining share, which has driven higher volumes, a little help by EM, and just broad-based participation across all aspects of the foreign exchange market.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","And Mike, it's Eric. I'd just add that the market share gains and kind of deepening our relationship with individual clients is what drives the kind of sustained year-on-year performance. The piece that's a little more volatile is whether you've got the flows going into EM and in to Europe and Asia like you did this quarter.","I think that was a nice uptick, but that's not always going to happen. And so what we found is having a broad-based franchise, because that's what we are. We're well distributed around the world with these global clients, actually is the way to build this business sustainably over years and years.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up. On the asset management side, just given the outflows this quarter, I don't know if you can put some perspective on it in terms of just kind of industry trends and some of the pressures that we're seeing there, maybe on the equity side. But in terms of the \u2013 some of the other maybe buckets like alternatives, can you just \u2013 what was maybe some one-offs versus how do you see that business growing going forward?","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Yes. Let me start out, Mike. I'll just decompose a little bit the flows and then make a few comments and invite Eric to make comments he wants. We had the flows of $28 billion, $22 billion of that was kind of institutional low-revenue outflows, the ETF story which is one that we've been focused on.","The quarter was a little bit unkind to domestic equities and therefore, we saw almost $10 billion in outflows of our big spike, S&P 500 fund. Take that out, we had $5 billion in inflows. So I would say, if I step back, we weren't thrilled with the quarter. We thought it was a little disappointing.","Over the last four quarters, our ETF flows have been at $56 billion net inflows. So a little softer on the ETF side, a little bit of it in environmental. We are \u2013 we continue to invest in distribution as well as new product introductions. We introduced nine new products in the second quarter, some in the smart beta space, which we think is an attractive and natural space for us. European ETF sales were good. It's a smaller market, but we really punched above our weight in Europe. So I would say that's kind of the broad-based commentary. The only other thing I would reference is if you look at the SSGA franchise, very global institutional ETF on a retail basis. We're focused on the ETF marketplace and also broadly solutions. And I referenced that we completed the GE Asset Management acquisition, which gives us a prominent position in the outsourced CIO marketplace.","We were able to add some incremental business from GE, the Alstom business, and I think that just builds a little momentum in the outsourced pension space. We're also doing pretty well on the outsourced \u2013 or the solutions for retail 401 (k)s, target date funds. So I'd say, my summary would be not a particularly great quarter for SSGA. I think the trends are intact. Our focus on ETFs and solutions would be my summary.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","And Mike, it's Eric, I'd just add. This is an attractive business for us. ETFs have good price realization relative to the overall price yield in asset management, and that's what's actually been supporting the revenues. And so incumbent upon us to predict \u2013 to continue to invest and make sure those investments bear fruit in ETFs, because not only in the U.S. but around the world, they're here to stay, we have to do is just pick our spots and make sure we do that in areas like smart beta or high-yield fixed income that are more fragmented where we feel like we can build share and the scale at pace to earn good returns.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I know you touched on this before, but the enhanced custody business really feels like it's becoming a pretty meaningful driver of securities finance. So, can you elaborate a bit on how meaningful that is in terms of the overall securities finance contribution and the growth and where you'd like to get it to?","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Sure. I'll start that, Geoffrey. You are right to pick up on that. We've seen steady and consistent growth in our enhanced custody business. I think this quarter it approached 50% of the overall revenues. And as I say, that's been steadily climbing. And I think it's a business that plays right into some of the capital constraints that traditional prime brokers have. And as our clients take on enhanced custody, they tend to deepen relationships over time, pretty stable, pretty steady. So I would see that business continuing to gain share in the credit intermediation space for funds.","Some of that is in the kind of the long, short type portfolio is probably where it's most prominent. But good business, I think we were a clear innovator four or five years ago and we're now reaping the benefits of that investment.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","And apart from the traditional prime brokers, is there any other competition there?","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","No, I'd say that's the typical competition. It's \u2013 you see funds diversifying their credit exposure, which is how we pick up business, new funds being created. No, it's mostly the prime brokers are the other alternative.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jay for any closing remarks.","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Thanks, Victoria, and thanks everybody for participating this morning.

On our call today, our Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, will speak first. Then, Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our Third quarter 2017 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit your questions to two and then re-queue.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include operating-basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measures are available in the appendix to our 3Q 2017 slide presentation.","In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.","Now, let me turn it over to Jay.","Joseph Hooley","Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I'd like to take a moment to thank Anthony Ostler, who has moved into a business line role and also to welcome to State Street our new Head of IR, Ilene Fiszel Bieler. Ilene recently joined us and has over 15 years of experience in the financial services industry and is reaching out to those of you she doesn't already know.","Now, to my remarks, we have delivered another very good quarter. Our third quarter results, including EPS growth and a meaningful increase in return on equity reflect continued strength in equity markets and strong business momentum. We are continuously advancing new product solutions to support our client success, which in turn has helped drive new servicing commitments of $105 billion.","Importantly, new business opportunities remain robust across both our asset servicing and asset management businesses. We remain well positioned to achieve our 2017 financial goals, including objectives associated with State Street Beacon. Through Beacon initiatives, we are focusing on delivering what matters most to our clients and their clients in less time and with less risk. By improving speed, adding data and analytics capabilities and upgrading client-facing technologies, we are enhancing the end-to-end client experience. While we continue to invest in our business, returning capital to our shareholders remains a key priority.","In 3Q 2017, we purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock and declared quarterly common stock dividend of $0.42 per share. Now, turning to Slide number 5, I'd like to review some of the progress we made on our strategic priorities and key achievements this quarter. Our core franchise continues to grow. Strength in equity markets and new business lifted our assets under custody and administration to record levels with growth of 10% from third quarter of 2016 to $32.1 trillion.","And for the first time, we've also exceeded $1 trillion in assets under administration in each of our two offshore businesses, in Luxemburg and Ireland. And as I mentioned, the pipeline remains strong. Our total new business yet to be installed at quarter end was sizeable at $390 billion, which we expect to onboard over the next 18 months. SSgA finished the quarter with $2.7 trillion in assets under management, a 9% increase from the third quarter last year, primarily driven by market appreciation as well as follow-on wins from the acquired GE Asset Management business and higher yielding ETF inflows. It's come primarily from institutional investors.","Continuing with our focus on new products and solutions, we recently announced the launch of a suite of low-cost SPDR portfolio ETFs, targeted at a new distinct channel to registered investment advisors. To focus on the separate distribution segment, we have partnered with TD Ameritrade, the number-three registered investment advisor platform as their sole distributor or 15 low-cost commission-free ETFs.","Across the industry, approximately 60% of ETF flows are being directed to this fast growing segment and partnering with a top distributor allows us to expand our delivery through this new channel. Beacon continues to drive scale across our business as we optimize and automate our solutions. For example, in our core U.S. mutual fund segment, which is approximately $7 point trillion in assets, Beacon has enabled us to accelerate the development of capabilities to allow clients to respond to the upcoming SEC modernization requirement, as well as improve the end-of-day pricing process by 20 minutes to 30 minutes.","In closing, we're committed to achieving our financial goals as reflected by our third quarter operating base year-over-year 27% EPS growth, positive fee and total operating leverage, as well as improving pretax margins, all while turning capital to shareholders and improving our ROE by 2.3 percentage points to 13.4%.","Now, let me turn the call over to Eric, who will review our financial performance for the third quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2017 and following that we'll take your questions.","Eric Aboaf","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6, where I will start my review of our operating basis results for 3Q 2017.","EPS for 3Q 2017 increased to $1.71 per share, up 27% from 3Q 2016. Return on equity for the quarter improved to 13.4%, a 2.3 percentage point - 2.3 percentage point higher than last year's third quarter.","3Q 2017 results reflect continued strength in equity markets and new business activity in both our asset servicing and asset management businesses. 3Q 2017 results also benefited from the rising interest rate environment and disciplined liability pricing, resulting in an expanding NIM and strong NII, which I'll discuss further in a moment.","3Q 2017 expenses continue to be well controlled, the weaker U.S. dollar added 1% of expense growth relative to 3Q 2016. As a reminder, the currency impact associated with expenses is largely offset in revenues.","3Q 2017 results also benefitted from a lower than expected tax rate of 28%, primarily due to a higher share of lower tax, foreign earnings, which was worth approximately $0.04 a share.","We delivered positive operating fee leverage relative to 3Q 2016 as we continue to focus on calibrating expenses relative to the revenue environment. Importantly, pre-tax margin improved meaningfully to 32.9% increasing 2.2 percentage points from 3Q 2016.","And on a year-to-date basis, we continue to see good progress against our financial goals demonstrated by delivering EPS growth of 21% and 2.7 percentage points of positive fee operating leverage.","Now let me turn to Slide 7 to briefly review growth of two key drivers. Both, AUCA and AUM increased again this quarter. AUCA of $32.1 trillion, increased 10% from 3Q 2016, growth was driven by a combination of market appreciation and good business momentum. New business activity was particularly strong in EMEA.","At State Street Global Advisors, AUM increased 9% from 3Q 2016 driven by market appreciation, new business related to the higher yield in GE Asset Management operations and ETF inflows as we continue to expand our franchise, partially offset by continued outflows from lower fee institutional mandates during the quarter.","Please turn to Slide 8, where I'll primarily focus on 3Q 2017 fee revenue results relative to 3Q 2016. You'll also find additional detail on the appendix with the sequential quarter comparison to 2Q. Overall, fee revenues increased 5% from 3Q 2016, driven by higher equity markets and new business activity. On a sequential basis, overall fee revenues were flat given the usual summer seasonality end markets activity.","Servicing fees increased 4% and 1% from 3Q 2016 and 2Q 2017 respectively, reflecting higher global equity markets, new business wins particularly in EMEA and the U.S. middle-office services, and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. These were partially offset by continued outflows from hedge funds, which caused us more than 1% of servicing fee growth on a year-on-year basis, as certain large players in the industry continue to see lower balances. We have seen some signs of this trends starting to moderate.","Management fees demonstrated strong growth for 3Q 2016 increasing 14% reflecting higher global equity markets, and cash, and ETF flows. Fees were up, excluding the market impact, as lower fee institutional asset outflows were more than offset by better fee ETF and cash inflows as well as new wins from the GE Asset Management operation.","Trading services revenue decreased from 3Q 2016, primarily due to lower foreign exchange volatility than what we experienced after last year's Brexit vote, partially offset by higher client volumes. We gained market share and real - with Real Money investors moving from number seven to number five in the most recent Euromoney survey.","Securities finance fees increased from 3Q 2016, primarily due to continued growth in our Enhanced Custody business.","Moving to Slide 9, NII was up 20% and NIM was up 29 basis points from 3Q 2016. As you can see from the graph momentum in NII continued in 3Q 2017, driven by higher U.S. interest rates and disciplined balance sheet management across major currencies in which we operate.","On a sequential basis, 3Q 2017 NII and NIM benefitted from realizing a full quarter of the June rate increased and disciplined liability pricing. Notably, U.S. interest bearing client deposit betas remain relatively low around 25%. Deposits decreased sequentially, as we continue to reduce higher cost CDs and non-USC [ph] deposits, and saw the slow rotation of client deposits from non-interest bearing accounts to interest bearing.","U.S. interest bearing client deposit costs increased by only 5 basis points sequentially. Overall, we're pricing deposits carefully and reducing wholesale CDs, which were down $15 billion year-over-year to manage the size of our balance sheet in line with our January guidance have down 0% to 5% for 2017.","Now I'll turn to Slide 10 to review 3Q 2017 expenses. 3Q 2017 expenses increased approximately 4% from 3Q 2016 with approximately 1 percentage point of that increase related to foreign currency translation. Excluding the FX impact, the increase in expenses was driven by new business, annual merit and performance based incentive as well as additional investments in technology, partially offset by Beacon related savings and lower professional fees.","Compensation and employee benefits increased from a year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting increased costs to support new business, annual merit and incentive compensation and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by Beacon savings. Notably, almost 2 percentage points of the year-over-year increase in compensation benefits was related to a sizeable mandate and which we lifted out a portion of the clients' employees. This is an example of the increasing expenses that we expect during the on-boarding period for some large clients.","Compared to 3Q 2016, information systems, transaction processing and occupancy costs increase the result of new business and Beacon related investments, other expenses decreased from 3Q 2016, primarily reflecting lower professional services fees.","3Q 2017 GAAP results also included a pre-tax $33 million Beacon restructuring charge, which will provide payback on average within the next five to six quarters. As compared to 2Q 2017, expenses increased only 1% and were flat excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.","Let me now turn to Slide 11 to review our progress on State Street Beacon. Beacon remains on track to achieve $550 million in targeted program savings, including at least $140 million in 2017. On the left side of the slide, we show the year-over-year growth benefits and investments related to Beacon. Each quarter we carefully pace the level of investment to consider multi-year initiative, support immediate opportunities and calibrate this to the external environment.","The net benefit varies each quarter. And in third quarter 2017, we've recognized approximately $35 million in year-over-year expense savings. On a year-to-date basis, we have achieved approximately $100 million in pre-tax expense savings relative to our $140 million target.","On the right side of the slide, we've broken out the key initiatives and percentage of the relative benefit approximately 70% of the projected growth benefit in 2017 comes from driving scale across our global platform. The balance comes from improving our technology and driving Beacon deeper into our organization. Each year the mix of benefits will change as we identify opportunities for improvement.","And as I mentioned last quarter, we continue to make good progress expanding Beacon across the organization. We're getting traction with both the corporate functions and SSGA, while we also centralize our procurement and real estate processes.","Now let's turn to Slide 12 to review our balance sheet and capital position. We continue to maintain a high-quality balance sheet, our investment portfolio is well constructed and diversified, but we've chosen to modestly reduce our credit securities to make room for direct client lending, and to better prepare for our internal stress test and the annual CCAR process.","We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases, including buying back $350 million of common stock and declaring in dividend of $0.42 in the third quarter. At the same time, we continue to strengthen our capital ratios by retaining income and by optimizing the size of our balance sheet. Specifically, you can see that our Tier 1 leverage ratio increased 90 basis points from last December to 7.4%. Our SLR also increased nicely.","Moving to Slide 13, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our original and updated financial outlook for full-year 2017 and for fourth quarter. In summary, strong 3Q 2017 and year-to-date results have us well positioned to exceed our 2017 financial target. Year-to-date revenue growth of greater than 8% and fee operating leverage of more than 2.5 percentage points reflect our focus on driving top line growth, while calibrating expenses against the revenue backdrop. This balanced approach in 2017 has resulted in a year-to-date pre-tax margin of almost 31%.","Based on the strong results, let me provide a brief update on our 4Q 2017 outlook. First, we expect higher 4Q servicing fees to be offset by muted trading revenues compared to third quarter, as we continue to see less market volatility. Overall, we expect to exceed our 2017 full year guidance of 6% to 7% fee revenue growth, and even excluding the gain on a couple of divestitures, we expect to be at the high-end of that range.","Second, on the expense front, we expect a slight 4Q 2017 increase over third quarter, largely driven by expenses associated with new business activity. 4Q 2017 expenses will also be dependent on the revenue backdrop in the quarter and the onboarding of new clients. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to be at the high end of our full year fee operating leverage guidance of 100 to 200 basis points.","Third, we expect to see continued NIM expansion 4Q of a few basis points, from bit more asset re-pricing and continued liability management. We also expect a slightly smaller balance sheet as we continue to build capital ratios and prepare for CCAR. We thus expect NII to be relatively flat to 3Q and anticipate that this will put us at the top-end of our full-year NII guidance.","Lastly, as I mentioned earlier, we expect our 4Q tax rate to increase relative to the third quarter, resulting in a full-year operating basis tax rate near the low-end of our full-year range of 30% to 32%.","In summary, we're very pleased that both our strong 3Q results and year-to-date performance sets us up well to achieve the higher full year 2017 financial guidance that we discussed in July. Now, let me turn the call back to Jay.","Joseph Hooley","Thanks, Eric. Victoria, we will now - we are now available to handle questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks, good morning. Hey, Eric, I was wondering if you could just talk us through some of the balance sheet permutations. I know you've been purposely trying to get the leverage ratio up going into CCAR 2018 versus where it was a year ago. Going into the fourth quarter at 7.4%, can you just talk to us about how you're trying to still hold back the rate of growth in the overall balance sheet and what we should expect for the mix going forward?","Eric Aboaf","Sure, Ken. Let me give you a little context. I think a year-and-a-half, two years ago, we made a - decided choice to reduce the size of the balance sheet and bring deposits down to the tune of $20 billion to $25 billion. I think it's an ongoing process and we saw a little bit of a tick up towards the end of last year during third quarter and fourth quarter, which is why we signaled in January that we wanted to bring the balance sheet to trend it back down.","And I think we're making good headway. You saw that fourth quarter last year our balance sheet was about 5% higher than it is now. So we feel like we made good progress, our tier 1 leverage, which tends to be our binding constraint under CCAR and some of the stress test, was that 6.5%. And the kind of the work that we've done, both with clients and then with non-client deposits, including the CD book that, that we had built several years back has really positioned us well now with a tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.4%.","Going into the fourth quarter, I think those efforts continue. Nothing dramatic, but we continue to expect a mild trend downwards as the - as we continue to unwind the CD book, as we continue to compress the current - a couple of higher cost deposit areas. And our view is that, it will set us up well for the coming year. And then it's - to be honest, it sets us up well for growing naturally, right, over the course of the coming years, as AUCA grows at a nice pace between market and new business wins, clients expect to be able to leave a little more deposits each year with us and I think we'll kind of get back into more of a business as usual mode at that point.","Ken Usdin","Got it. And my second questions, just on the U.S.\/non-U.S. point, you've had the benefits of the currency mismatch and then you have the swap that kind of works that out. Can you just help us understand if the BOE and ECB, who have been getting more hawkish start to hike rates? How will that actually flow through the NIM and net interest income?","Eric Aboaf","Hey, Ken, it's certainly something on our minds, right, because the U.S. has clearly moved 4 times over the last year, which we're quite pleased to see. The Bank of England is starting to signal and market expectations are probably a bit better than half that they'll move. It's been moving around. And the ECB is really talking about - at some point slowing down their expansionary policy. I think for the way to think about it, is about half of our net NII interest rate exposure to rising rates within the U.S. and the other half is in international markets which is primarily sterling and euros.","You saw us take up NII just from rising rates in the U.S. by $20 million to $25 million a quarter. So it's sizable and if you think about - sterling will help a little bit if it moves and euros even more. But you could see, as and when that happens, I think some more NIM expansion, which would be a good result.","Ken Usdin","Got it. Thanks, Eric.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell","Hey, good morning. Maybe we could just talk a little bit about the fee rate. I appreciate the color on hedge funds. I think even if we think about adding the 1% drag back, AUCA was up 10%, fees were up, say, normalized 5%, if normalized for hedge funds. Do we see - I know ETFs have been a growth area that's probably lower margin. But is there some sense that we could start to see those move more in tandem at some point going forward?","Joseph Hooley","Hey, Jim, this is Jay. Let me start that one. I'll let Eric jump in. So the one thing I guess I'd just reorient you to is the third quarter 2017 versus 2016 up 4%, year-to-date up 4%. Third quarter little bit of a softer quarter from a service fee standpoint. I'd say, I'd point to a couple of things, one, the mix which you mentioned is mixed and you see - in the U.S., you see U.S. fund outflows offset by ETF inflows, almost one for one if you look at the industry.","And then if you - we reference hedge funds, which continue to see outflows, although industry data would suggest maybe that has hit the tipping point. We haven't yet seen that in our book, but were - a pretty good reflection of the overall hedge fund industry. And if you go outside the U.S., I'd point to, Eric mentioned that in his comments, EMEA, or more specifically Europe played out through the offshore centers of Ireland and Luxembourg, continue to see very strong flows, which is a mix of long-only product hedge and ETFs as well.","So I would say the mix has been pretty consistently like that. I wouldn't read anything into the quarter itself. I look more on the year-on-year to look at the reflection of kind of the service fees. The only thing I would add before I ask Eric if he wants to add to this is the - the pipeline is good. It's good. It's well diversified. And it's probably proportionately a little heavier in big deal activity, which you know for me is a reflection of more folks looking to consolidate work among fewer custodians, and an interest in doing a deeper level of outsourcing, think about middle office is one component of that. So I'd say, generally, pretty steady as it goes. I don't know what you'd add to that.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah, Jim, I'd just add on the fee rate. Just remember, this isn't the - the servicing business is a little different than the asset management business, in asset management the fee rates are linear, right, as you add more assets you get automatically higher revenues in services. You kind of get 10% higher market. AUCAs is only 3% in equity. It's 10% [ph] and 1% [ph] in fixed income. So you kind of have that denominator effect. And then you have the mix of whether it's hedge funds, whether it's emerging markets are at higher rates than the U.S. and so on and so forth.","So I think the way we think about the fee rate is it's something to track, because the question is, as Jay described, are you doing more business with clients, more business with existing clients and the more business you do with existing clients tends to offset the mathematical reduction you'll get in fee rates just from the way the numerator and denominator work through.","James Mitchell","Okay, well, that's all helpful color. And maybe just my second question, Eric, you've been now at State Street for a little while. What's your sense of Project Beacon? Do you feel like there is - are there any more opportunities as you look into this more over the course of the next few years or do you feel like it is good target or an easy target, trying to get a sense of - your sense of the expense line as you dig into it?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah, Jim, I think the - my perspective on Project Beacon, like you say, I've dug into it now. I've dug into it at a couple of levels of details as you'd expect and it's something that Jay and Mike initiated a couple of years back and really was a follow on to that original ITOT effort. I have a lot of confidence to be honest that there is a lot to do. And why is that, because we run a servicing process and system that has become more and more automated over time.","But you remember, we take on very large mandates from very large asset managers, pension funds, insurance companies. And they usually hand them over to us in a fairly bespoken customized manner. And they like it when we execute on them in that basis. And so, there is a lot of work to do as you march across one large client to the next large client, to the group of medium sized clients, as you march around the world to continue automate and digitize and simplify those processes over time. And so, as I looked underneath, Beacon isn't one effort, right, it's actually dozens and dozens of effort.","So there is a lot there. And I think it will be something that we keep at. We originally announced it as a four, five-year program. I think our view is Beacon will continue, right, because it's got to be part of our DNA and how we manage the business. And then I think I did say in my prepared remarks, there are also new areas of Beacon that we continue to push on, whether it's the corporate functions, right. We spend a $1.3 billion or so of our $8 billion expense base in the corporate functions and so that needs to be under scrutiny as well, carefully, but under scrutiny.","Ron O'Hanley is driving Beacon into the asset management business. So there is always more to do and I think we see good opportunities in the coming years.","James Mitchell","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thank you. Quickly on the assets under custody and administration, the insurance and other products is down another 5% in the quarter. The markets have been doing good, something unique in the quarter to point out?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah, Glenn, it's Eric, and I think for the others on the phone, I think you're pointing to the supplemental information package on the assets under custody are on Page 7. There is actually nothing significant going on with the insurance clients. I think the line you're looking at, which is the fourth one down, is actually - has three sub-lines, got insurance, got private equity and it's got other - insurance and private equity are actually flat sequentially, so some upticks offsetting some - just the usual movement.","And then the other line which you kind of can see underneath the surface is more volatile and that's due to timing of installations. What effectively happens as we bring on new business, right it gets categorized in other and then you need to do a detailed categorization up into the lines above and that just plays over a couple of months. So you've seen this - I think we've seen this volatility a little bit before and just think of it as classification volatility, nothing more than that.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, okay, and then quickly on balance sheet, I noticed, the rate paid on your U.S. deposits is down the last couple of quarters, which is also in a raising rate environment. I'm just curious if you could talk towards how you manage that dialogue and what type of clients that is.","Eric Aboaf","Sure. Glenn, there's a couple of things in the U.S. deposits on the average interest earning balance sheets, right? There is the - I'll call core client deposits and then there is the wholesale CD book that we had built up to the tune of a bit over $15 billion year-and-a-half, two years ago. So what's happening on that line is you actually see a mix effect. As the CD book comes down, the overall rate paid on total U.S. deposits is coming down.","And that's offsetting the slight increase that we're seeing quarter-on-quarter, as we adjust rates up a little bit every time the Fed has moved. If you wanted to unbundle that the cost of deposits for just the U.S. client deposits is up 5 basis points, right, against a 25 basis points move in at the Fed and that's where we - that's how we quote the beta of 25%.","So kind of it's moving up exactly as we would have expected at this - given the external dynamics.","Glenn Schorr","Awesome. Thanks, Eric.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah. My pleasure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein","Hey, good morning, everybody. So I had a follow-up around just the servicing business either for Jay or Eric. Totally get the fee rate dynamic, obviously more of an output and as we've learnt over the years. But I guess taken a step back given the mix shift dynamic with hedge funds. The BlockRock issue coming up, I guess, next year with some of the loss business, but then clearly some positives on the non-U.S. side, et cetera. Holding kind of market's effects flat, what do you guys see as a reasonable organic growth for the servicing fee revenues over the next couple of years?","Eric Aboaf","Alex, it's Eric. It's hard to tell precisely, which is why we have - we've stuck to our general view that we should focus on overall fee growth, we said 6% to 7% now that was up from 4% to 6%, there is obviously some market movement in there. You see the - I think, if you want to dive down into servicing fees specifically, you see those were up 2% on a currency adjusted basis year-on-year, and up 4% year-to-date, right. And so the - in our mind 4% for a little more representative.","Now clearly, there's a number of factors in there, right. There is some market appreciation, there's some inflows and outflows, and we called out more than a percentage point from the hedge fund business, there is some amount of new business activity, and then there's a very important amount of expanding activity with existing business, and then there's a little bit fee headwinds, more or less than we've seen before, but it's always been a little bit of that over the last couple of decade.","So it's - I think, it's hard to be precise and part of what we're trying to navigate through is, we're always looking at what business can we bring on, at what fee rate. But in particular at what margin, right, because it's the margin that really matters at the end of the day.","And then, as we think about new business at the right margin, and then, we kind of get to fee operating leverage, and we feel like we have a business system that is remunerative. So anyway hopefully that's enough guidance to start.","Alexander Blostein","Got it. Thanks. And just quick follow-up around the NIM and the balance sheet dynamic. So clearly, very nice job on kind of remixing the funding and optimizing the strategy a bit, it sounds like there is a little bit more to do here in the fourth quarter as well. But also taking to step back kind of assuming the composition of the funding structures in place more or less so in the U.S. now, how should we think about the kind of NIM sensitivity to next - to near future funds and hikes given kind of changes we saw on the funding side now?","Eric Aboaf","Sure, Alex. Let me - it's Eric, let me continue. I think, we're comfortable with our NIM sensitivity and in particular the position where we expand NII in the rising rate environment. I think, we've done - we've captured that benefit in the U.S. for the first three or four hikes, and that's been quite positive for us, and has helped us buoy NIM, but also margins and ROEs, that's important.","I think, we'd like some amount of NIM sensitivity for the U.S. going forward, if we got a December hike, then we might as well stay open, right on from a rate position. And I think the Fed has signaled they want to get to - maybe not 3% terminal Fed funds, but two and three quarters. And we feel like, there is a big distance between now and then. And you remember the opportunity cost of running an open sensitive position to rising rates for us. As a custody bank is not very high, because at the front end of the curve, right? The front end of the curve is not particularly steep. So anyway long way to say that I think we'd like the open position in the U.S., we talked on one of the earlier questions being open in sterling and in euros, is helpful. It doesn't mean that if the 10-year doesn't spike up or we see some volatility where we have some nice uptick. We invest a little bit, but I think directionally we like the open position to rising rates.","Alexander Blostein","Got you. I understood. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So first, Glenn had asked about the U.S. deposit costs, which you walked through nice, Eric. Thank you. On the non-U.S. side though, I think, if we adjust for the FX swap costs, we saw pretty decent pickup in the deposit costs there. Could you - number one, is that right? And then, if it is could you maybe walk through us going on there? Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah, I think on the international - what we've called the non-U.S. deposits on the interest bearing schedule, which is the Page 13, the math you'll want to do is to isolate the FX swap, which we put in the footnote, because remember the currency swaps, while they're tied the deposits from an accounting standpoint are offset on the interest earning asset size primarily they're in the deposits of the banks or in securities that we hold.","If you were to, though - and if you do that math and we're happy to follow-up Brennan, as a - to help out with that. And you were to strip out the currency swaps, the change on the international side is, I think, literally 1 or 2 basis points, so it's relatively flat and within the scheme of what you'd have in any particular quarter. So we're not seeing much there, and we don't expect to see much there until either the Bank of England moves or ECB moves. And what I think it'd be a good day when that happen to be honest.","Brennan Hawken","Sure, sure. Thanks. I'll follow-up on the math there. Another question on the deposit front would be non-interest bearing, we saw that decline. I think, you spoke about how there was some remixing and some clients that were rotating out of the non-interest bearing and into the interest bearing side. Do you guys have any view about ultimately where that might end up shaking out with the mix or look like non-interest bearing to interest bearing. How should we think about that going forward? Thanks a lot.","Joseph Hooley","Sure, Brennan. I think, you are - what you've seen so far is actually even better or kind of within expectations or even a bit better, right. We saw a pretty slight $2 billion move out of non-interest bearing, which actually all ended up in interest bearing, when we actually did the detail tracking. And that's well within the bounds, it actually continues to positively surprise, how little has actually moved. And in truth if it moves, it's not that big of a deal. A couple billion a quarter would not be - is kind of well within, in fact it continues to be below expectations.","In terms of terminal questions sort of where does it go, I got to say really hard to predict, I think, we don't see a fast move. So the question is, what's the - how much does it move and at what pace. And you've seen some - you've our results here, which are down just $2 billion quarter-on-quarter and about twice that year-on-year. I think, you've seen some of the industry results, which are probably a little bit more than that, but I think we fared well.","And so it's hard to say, what that's going to be, I think you can look at the long range percentages of non-interest bearing to what the interest bearing. That's said, I think, pricing is different in this cycle, because we are pricing more adroitly for different types of deposits, right. Deposits that our LCR valuable, those that our non-LCR valuable. So I'm not giving you a sharp answer, because I think there is a range of results, and our view is, we should just work closely with our clients and to the extent they have a little bit in those pools. We'll help them, adjust them if they'd like to at the right time.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks for the color, Eric.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Lynn Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Joseph Hooley","Good morning. Go ahead, Betsy.","Betsy Lynn Graseck","Hi, good morning. Hi. Question on the outlook. I know that on Page 13 of the slide deck, you reiterated the guidance you gave in 2Q 2017 call. But then at the end of this call, you were highlighting that you thought you would exceed the 6% to 7% total fee growth range. Can you just give me a sense as to whether or not you're anticipating that full year could actually come above the high end of the range you've got here? Maybe you could speak a little bit to the operating leverage that you're looking for in the quarter.","Eric Aboaf","Sure. Betsy, it's Eric. Let me start. I think, we feel good about the results overall on fee growth year-to-date. A little bit - bounce around a little bit quarter by quarter. But the way we've described this is that we feel like, on a full year basis for fees, which have been running about 8% year-to-date, we're going to be over the 6% to 7%. I think, I also said that if you wanted to put aside the BlockCross sale and the other first quarter IFDS, BFDS transfer agency sale, that if you put those ex slide, you're closer to the top end of the 7% range. And so it just gives you a little bit of data by which to calibrate what we expect.","Betsy Lynn Graseck","Okay. So your Page 13 is more organic versus - the results will be obviously organic plus some inorganic activity. Is that fair to say?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah, that's a good way to frame it.","Betsy Lynn Graseck","Okay. And then, the follow-up is just on the SLR in the prefs. If the rule changes with SLR and we're - you are able to eliminate cash or reduce cash in the denominator of the SLR, is there any action you can take on your outstanding prefs? Or do you have to wait for them to mature?","Eric Aboaf","It's Eric again. There - each of the series of prefs that we have out there, and there are several have a call date. The call date was typically five years out from the original issuances. So I think, there is some calls coming through over the next 12 to 18 months. And it actually gives us, I think, a nice bit of flexibility. So I think what we put out there was good at the time. And if the rules change, we can always adjust a bit.","Betsy Lynn Graseck","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","Hi, I have one question about a negative trend and one question about a positive one. So the negative would be foreign exchange. It stays - it's staying very low. And do you see any change in that? And if volatility were to increase, say, 10%, what's the sensitivity of those revenues? And also, I - just on the topic of foreign impact. Emerging market asset values were up 8% quarter-over-quarter and I thought that would have had more of a positive effect on your custody fees.","Eric Aboaf","Sure, Mike. It's Eric. Let me start on both of those. So first, on foreign exchange trading. I think there's just some evolution here given the volatility that we're seeing in the marketplace, right. And that's primarily what we attribute the changes to. If you recall, we had a particularly strong second quarter as we saw a very large shift to emerging markets. Emerging markets have typically much higher volatility and much wider spreads wider spreads, and I think we took full advantage of that in 2Q.","And then a year ago, obviously, we had the backdrop of Brexit. So we're just seeing a lower level of volatility, and I think we're cautious. Underneath that market-driven kind of environment, though, we're seeing good volume growth - we're seeing good volume growth in developed markets. We've been drilling down. We've seen good volume growth in emerging markets. You see some of the results from the Euromoney survey, which isn't perfect, but it's indicative.","And so we're actually, I think, quite pleased, and our view is if volatility comes back, we'll see some uptick. Hard to give you a percentage uptick. I'd do more of - 2Q was a standout. You can look at how much volatility spiked and kind of do some math, and we're happy to kind of be a sounding board for you as you do that. So I think what we're focused on is building that franchise. The franchise has been building. It feels like it's - by our estimate, it's picking up 0.5 point to a percentage point of market share over the last year or two, which in FX is actually significant.","Maybe to the second question, on servicing fees, yeah, the equity markets were up nicely. Remember, bond market is not so much, alternative markets were kind of still are relatively flattish. So you got to do a weighted average kind of math here on the market indicators. That's why in the press release we actually give you a table of six different indicators, because it's a mix of those that really affect our business.","And then, over and above that, there is the mix, how much are we taking on in ETF versus mutual funds, how much in the U.S., emerging markets. And so, the math kind of just moves around quite a bit, which is why we're focused both on a quarter but also on a year-to-date basis. And just we're kind of navigating through as we go here.","Mike Mayo","And then the other question, management fees are up quite nicely linked quarter and year-over-year. What's happening in asset management and with the GE acquisition? And would you consider more asset management acquisitions?","Joseph Hooley","Let me start that one, Mike. This is Jay. It's a factor of really shifting out of lower-revenue-generating assets and into higher-generating revenue assets. So if you look at SSgA in the third quarter, which had a net $25 billion in outflows, $40 billion, went out of largely passive institutional mandates, which has been a bit of a trend. And on the other side, you saw $12 billion into positive flows into cash, and $2 billion, positive flows into ETF. It's out of the lower revenue into the higher revenue, which results in management fees up 14% and AUMs up 9%.","And that's not a one-quarter trend. We continue to see that, and it's been part of our strategy to focus on the higher-revenue-generating asset pools. I don't know if you'd add anything to that.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah, I think it's a good result and you mentioned GE. Even there, we've bought it on. We've gone to accretion sooner than expected by a quarter. So that was, I think, good work by the team. But we also added some of the - some additional mandates, in particular some of the GE UK pension, the OSRAM [ph] pension and so it's been a nice platform and a good result.","I think you also asked about acquisitions. Let me maybe start there, Jay will probably weigh in, too. But we like this, the kind of tuck-in asset management space, it's attractive. The accretion works out pretty well. Given the relative PEs of ours versus the asset management space, that was a nice size deal. And so clearly, they've come up from time to time, but it's certainly a good use of capital from our standpoint.","Joseph Hooley","Yeah, I'd agree with all that, Mike, and I would say that if you look at where the gaps are and our asset management capabilities, we've got a bunch of gaps on the fixed-income side, a little bit on the equity and alternatives side. So to the extent that we can backfill those gaps, it makes us a more relevant player on the solutions space. I might just go one other place, Mike, on the asset management, which is, we recently announced that we were entering the low-cost ETF marketplace, and organically, although with a partner.","The ETFs, 60% of ETF flows over some period of time have been on this low-cost ETF space, and State Street really hasn't participated because we haven't had the access to retail distribution. And so, we think it's a good move to enter a new distribution channel by taking 15 of our ETFs, translating them into low fees in concert with the TD Ameritrade partnership. TD is the third largest retail distributor. So it takes the ETFs, repurposes a handful of them, very low revenue give-up and positions us into this part of the market that's driving 60% of the flow.","So not acquisitions we made there, but we do think that fills out a segment of the distribution market that we haven't been present in, and we think this enables that.","Mike Mayo","Well, we'll watch that. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Oh, good morning, thank you for taking the question. Maybe the first one on the operating basis EPS number. Perhaps you could remind us the logic for stripping out the restructuring charges, which feel like they occur to a greater or lesser degree most quarters but not stripping out something like the BlockCross gain on the business sale.","And then any thoughts about whether it makes sense to continue posting operating EPS or switch away to GAAP, which is what most banks do?","Eric Aboaf","Geoffrey, it's Eric. Let me take that and I think you and I talked about that, and I certainly got a lot of feedback as I started back in December and January. I do agree that over time, GAAP results are something that we want to move towards. I think as you know, we've run a mix of both operating and GAAP results, we show them both so you can kind of see them both ways, so there are no surprises.","I think what you've seen me do this year so far is actually narrow the difference, and we've done that both on some positives and some negatives together. And I think you can always kind of find one thing or another to add back. But I think what we'd like to do is move to a more standard presentation, and you'll see us doing that in the coming time periods. I just need to make sure that we're all - we design that well and we also do that with you all in mind so that it doesn't fluctuate with your models.","I will say that we will want, though, to continue to be able to identify some of the restructuring charges not because we shouldn't include them in the GAAP results or the final tally of how we do. But one of the reasons we have carved them out and carved them out of operating is actually just so that you can see the underlying momentum of the business and expense management and not color that with whether a charge is $35 million or $70 million in another quarter.","And so, we're just conscious that. I guess, the way I'd say is either way you are going to need to see the information. But because we are going to continue to optimize the business and drive Beacon, right, where are going to take a series of - I don't think it will be - well, series of expected charges. And we just want to make sure those are out there and everyone's expecting those.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thanks, very helpful. And then, on the Ameritrade partnership, I noticed a few of the ETFs there are shifting to self-indexing. Do you think there is a longer-term trend there towards self-indexing to reduce the cost of ETFs? Is that going to be something that we see more of?","Joseph Hooley","Geoffrey, this is Jay. Yes, I do think though. I think that in a world of low cost ETFs where every expense line matter to the extent that you can internalize or create some synthetic of an index or create your own indexing. I do see that as a trend, not just for State Street, but for others.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, guys.","Joseph Hooley","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","Hi, Jay. I had to jump off the call for a minute, so I apologize if I you had addressed these questions. But the first question is, obviously, you've started to restructure the liability side of the balance sheet, as you mentioned. I noticed the non-interest-bearing deposits in the quarter fell to about $39.7 billion on an average basis from $42.2 billion in the prior quarter and about $44 billion last year.","Aside from the obvious, interest rates are higher, were there any other factors that drove the non-interest-bearing deposits down.","Eric Aboaf","Gerard, it's Eric. No, it's literally an interest rate effect and clients are conscious of what accounts they have. They typically have multiple accounts, right, sometimes for the various fund family, sometimes geographically and sometimes just for operational purposes or preferences. But this is the moment that we've seen, which is kind of 5%, 6% in the quarter, we think, it's pretty modest given that the Fed moved, in effect, 25 basis points here. So nothing more than rates and kind of all within the bounds if not even less of a move than we would have expected at this point in the cycle.","Gerard Cassidy","If the Fed continues to raise rates, should we expect this line to continue on this kind of rate of decline? Or should it slow down, accelerate?","Eric Aboaf","Very hard to predict, right. We - the kind of the structure of what exists out there for clients to hold in terms of deposits versus money market funds versus prime money market funds, right, they're kind of options that has changed since the last set of rate increases more than a decade ago. I think for kind of a general view, I think this pace feels about right for the time being, but there could be a range of results around that. But this pace feels realistic as we see rate raises play through.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then my second question, I know this is not a significant part of the balance sheet, but in the other interest earning assets for the quarter of $23 billion, you had a nice jump from the second quarter yield from 76 basis points to 118. Okay, any color behind what drove that nice improvement.","Eric Aboaf","Yes, the other interest earning assets will include the Enhanced Custody activity, right, which is part of the sec finance business. And so as that - as we expand that business, we get paid both on the interest rate line as well as in fees.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question. Eric, just on that last one, maybe if you can differentiate what's happening with the repurchased securities line. I think that went up 97 basis points on a core basis. And then the Enhanced Custody dynamic on the other interest earning asset line, and if you can sort of parse out the Enhanced Custody contribution to that other line, that'd be great.","Eric Aboaf","Sure. Yeah, let me do those in reverse order. I think the - in interest earning assets - or other interest earning assets, which is about $23 billion, I think the large majority is Enhanced Custody and then you have a little bit of derivative balances and some of the other knits and gnats there. And so that's what's happening, and kind of underneath that in other interest earning assets, you'll find that derivative balances move around, but Enhanced Custody has actually been just moving up at a regular pace.","And I think we can expect some amount of expansion there as we continue to grow the business at a modest pace, and you saw it up 8% year-on-year on revenue side, and I think we kind of - we think about the balance sheet scales accordingly. In terms of the securities purchase for resale agreements, right, the repo line, I'll just remind you that what you have in there is the on-balance sheet repo and reverse book.","And then, the piece that is run through that FIC [ph] program or the - effectively sponsor a client, but it's the client's actual position and risk. We disclosed that in the footnotes and pretty well. I think what you'll see, as those rates continue - will continue to tick up in line with prevailing interest rates. So as the Fed moves, you've got movement in Fed funds, you've got movement in general collateral repo rates. And so what you're literally seeing is just the movement in market rates play through that activity.","Brian Bedell","Okay, okay, thanks. And then, maybe just to go back to the security servicing. I know, it's been asked - and I appreciate all your detail on it. But if we just think about sort of how the new business trends are coming forward, and maybe if, Jay, you can chime in on this as well, but with the shift towards ETFs, and I think, Jay, you mentioned some larger pieces of new business in the potential pipeline.","How should we think about that fee rate going forward? It looks like, of course, it's kind of dropped down sort of in a trough level in the third quarter. I was just trying to sense if that's a little bit of an abnormal drop. And - or do see that rates sort of being a good sort of go forward?","Joseph Hooley","Let me start that one, Brian. Let me start with your question about - I interpret it as being pipeline and activity in the marketplace, which, as I would say, quite good, quite diversified, proportionately more kind of big deal activities, and as I referenced a minute ago, I think that to me, it stands for firms in the asset management industry that are looking to get more efficient, looking to create more front-to-back straight through processing, and therefore consolidating with fewer providers.","There's a - it's rare that these big deals don't happen today without middle office, something that you know well as a component of that, we view that as all quite positive, because the deeper you get into the middle and front office, the more differentiated we are, particularly if you had to that multi-geographies. And therefore pricing - better pricing goes along with that.","So I would say that deal activity, deal pipeline quite good. I'd also call your attention to we've got a little bit higher pipeline of deals committed, but not yet installed at just under $400 billion, which we'll roll in over the next 18 months. I'd say that when I add all that up, I look at 4% kind of year-to-date service fee revenue growth, 4% quarter-on-quarter. That feels to me more like a number you should focus on in the quarter itself and the sequential effects of that. And would you had anything to add, Eric?","Eric Aboaf","I just add that we do feel good about the momentum of business. We're trying to be clear about that notwithstanding the lumpiness that you get quarter-to-quarter. And so we have some confidence, because we do have some visibility. Obviously, in what's the backlog, what's coming from the pipeline, and so forth.","On the fee rate specifically, I'll just remind you that as we add new wins, right, if we add - if we had the custody business for a big firm, and remember we have 40% share in the U.S. asset managers and the mutual fund business, right, if we had a custody and we're adding the accounting, right, you get fees with no incremental AUCA.","So you kind of get a positive effect on the fee rate. If instead what we're doing is, if we had half the book and somebody consolidating it, right, and had half of the custody book, and now you're adding the other half of the custody book. You're actually adding both a numerator and a denominator. So there's a lot going on there, which is why I think the fee rate's indicative.","But I'll just - it's indicative, but I think there's a lot going on in terms of whether you're expanding new clients, share of wallet with existing clients, and then all the ins and outs of geography and product type.","Brian Bedell","And then you mentioned you focus on the profitability, obviously, and improving that. For the some of these new deals that are in the pipeline, and how should we think about the on-boarding expense run rate? Should that be a little bit lumpy and high initially before we get to bring those in or more sort of this the same pattern?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah, it's Eric. I think, it depends on the deal sizes. So I think the small and medium sized deals, you kind of just roll into, and there's nothing particularly significant. I think with the larger deals, it depends how they're structured. And so we called out one from the middle of last year, and what regionally came over was literally a lift-out of business activity with rent costs, and people costs, and technology.","When you get them that way, you often get them with a TSA, because they literally can't move all the sub-pieces. And so it comes over as a step change. And then what happens is that you then convert from the TSA to the actual line items, right. But as you're doing that, you're effectively digesting. So you might take on 400 people, which is kind of a percentage point of additional headcount.","We know that we won't operate it that way in the subsequent years, but that's how we need to take it on. So kind of the bigger the deals, and I guess, we'll describe as we have big deals or - from time-to-time, we'll describe whether there are step changes, I don't think they are - they're enough to disrupt the full year expense growth story, but on a - and kind of trend. But on a quarter - a one quarter basis, there may be a little more or a little less.","And so I point to this quarter. Sequentially, we had no growth in expenses when you adjust for currency, right, and that's because there wasn't any big deals just coming in, in a lumpy way. In another quarter, you might easily put in for a percentage point of expense growth, because they were a big enough deal in a particular quarter. And so it's that kind of dynamic or range that we're talking about.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. I had a one very particular question, one big picture question. But Eric, first, the tax rate dropped off considerably this particular quarter to one of the lowest levels we've seen in several years. The explanation really doesn't talk about discrete benefits, but says it's really mix and energy investment. How would that cause a temporary kind of downdraft? Those things seem more permanent, whereas if you look at the guidance, you're saying it's going to bounce back up to the 30% kind of level?","Eric Aboaf","Marty, it's Eric. I've learned to love taxes over the years given how they come in and the lumpiness versus the non-lumpiness. What happens during the year, if you remember, is there are also re-forecasts of expectations with regard to the full year, because you have to set your tax rate based on the full-year expectation of your earnings. And so what happened this quarter is, as we saw more foreign earnings than U.S. earnings in the current quarter and expectations for that to continue into fourth quarter, you effectively have to reset your tax rate to that amount and effectively do a version of what feels like a catch-up.","So I think that's probably the best way to explain it, and I'm happy to take a little time off line. But it was - it creates a lumpy catch-up in the particular quarter there. I think on a year-to-date basis, we're running a little north of 29% on the tax rate, and I think we're - we still think we'll end up somewhere around the low end of the range - near the low end of the range that we've described.","Marty Mosby","So more of a permanent improvement as you move forward, putting it at the lower end of the range that makes that consistent. And then Jay and Eric, I have a bigger picture question in the sense that there's been a lot of talk over - since the financial crisis and recession that the trust business model was just broken. There was things that were falling off, and that you would never recreate profitability like you did it back in the golden days. If you kind of look at what you're doing, as soon as rates are starting to come off the floor, your returns are returning to, if not the highs, pretty close to that.","So you're getting within reach of - now you're well into the middle 13s, 14, 15 is kind of upper end of that range. So you see rates driving you back to that. So was there really anything broke about the model other than just interest rates are really low and now we're getting that benefit back?","Joseph Hooley","Yeah, I would say - This is Jay, Marty. I would say that nothing was broke, but a lot has changed. When I think back 10, 12 years, and I look at the upward slope of things like mutual fund flows, ETFs weren't even in the frame yet, I looked at a time when there was a fair amount of revenue generated in the market base revenues, foreign exchange, securities lending, net interest revenue, as you talk about, I think that from then to now, the business of asset servicing, asset ownership has become more challenging. Returns are a little bit more difficult.","So as we being a downstream - having downstream effect of that, we've had to change our operating model to be much more focused on creating efficiencies, creating straight-through processing, which - and also moving our business model from the back office to the middle office, heading to the front office, I might add. The value that customers see and what we provide on the servicing side today is much more around the data and analytics, which is why we're investing so deeply into Beacon because it's moving to a place where our ability to aggregate custodian data, inform it with data and analytics allows our customers to compete more effectively.","So I think that another backdrop comment I would make is that, if you look at the world as we see it, which is not a North American, but a global world, our estimate is gross assets are growing in the 6%-ish range. So the asset pools are up, but they've shifted from traditional products to ETFs, solutions, all of which requires a higher level of sophisticated technology to support our customers' needs in the future.","So I'm as bullish as I've ever been about our prospect and outlook from a standpoint of meeting our financial targets, but the underlying business has changed. And I think it provides a firm like State Street with a clear path to further distinguishing and differentiating ourselves as we move to middle, front office data and analytics informed by Beacon.","Marty Mosby","I guess, Jay, what I'm looking at is if you do all those changes what you've done in the operating model and expenses, and then you look at really at the bottom line, 80% of the your bottom line comes from net interest income. So everything else kind of nets out and it reminds me much of what we used to have in mortgage servicing where we did a lot of work. There is a lot of fees. The business always changed, always adapted to that. But at the end of the day, escrow balances was where we got our profitability.","So I'm just wondering if at the end of the day that those deposits really are where the value comes and it produces a majority of what you see in the actual pre-tax income.","Eric Aboaf","Marty, it's Eric. I'd just be a little cautious about going as far as you're going. But remember, you didn't have a custodial asset. There will be no reason for client to hold deposits with you. If you didn't have a custodial asset, they wouldn't hold your current - foreign currency trade with you. If you didn't have a custodial asset, you couldn't do custody accounting administration, front office data analytics, so highly inter-dependent business.","And does how you get paid adjust and evolve over time? Maybe, but our perspective I think is we should make sure we need - we understand well how we get paid in that business and make sure we get paid fairly. I think you saw returns on equity north of 13% this quarter, you've seen us do that a couple of quarters here.","Return on tangible common equity, which is a traditional bank measure is like in the 19% range. I mean, pretty - I don't know what the golden era was like that you refer to, but it's pretty attractive returns for an institution here with very nice EPS growth.","Marty Mosby","Now, on you returning to those golden age kind of return is what I was getting at as all it took was rates. But, yeah, I appreciate the time you spent on it. We'll talk about it little bit more offline.","Eric Aboaf","Good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier","Thanks, guys. Just one quick one here. Just on the servicing, maybe the overall relationship. Thanks for the color on the quarter, just on the products and asset classes. But it does seem like the clients are under more pressure, whether it's them facing fee pressure, new regulations. I just wanted to get an update like when you think about the other like offerings that you have, we look at one line item, but obviously you can generate revenues in other areas.","So I don't know if you have any update on how that shifted over time with the clients, the number of products and services that are being used. And then probably most importantly, given what you guys are doing on Beacon, like the incremental margin on clients today versus maybe three or four years ago before you went down this path, just so we can kind of get more of a holistic view versus just the one part of the business.","Joseph Hooley","Yeah, Mike, this is Jay. Thanks for the question, the - it's a good question, because in addition to the traditional packaging in the servicing business of accounting and custody, augmented by foreign exchange, trading and securities lending, more recently Enhanced Custody. I would say the package has been enhanced recently with - I mentioned, middle-office, which is where almost 24 years into middle-office, we were the pioneers and still the market leader by a long stretch.","As clients, as you rightly point out are faced with more pressure. There is more consolidation of providers, but the value they see is, now into the middle-office, our ability to aggregate custodian data and provide them a platform for front-office analytics. All the other stuff are still relevant, with the trading, the lending. But increasingly, the value proposition is in that middle and front office data aggregation, which is why we talk about Beacon.","And rightly, we're all focused on Beacon as an efficiency play, but it's much, much more than that to the extent that we can get our data, the $32 trillion in assets that we hold on behalf of clients or a specific client normalize, made available on a real-time basis, aggregate it with other custodian's data. It's a huge differentiator. And so, I think that that's what we're playing for and we think that long-term the big global asset manager is going to look for partners like that that can span global locations, that can move from the back office to the middle office, into the front office, all the while keeping all those other revenue pools intact, the trading, the securities lining and Enhanced Custody.","Eric Aboaf","And, Mike, it's Eric. I'd just add that to support that effort and those trends and those - that progress, we have fairly intense performance measurement that we do, sort of number of products, number of products per client for asset managers versus pension funds versus insurers. And we actually shared some of that at the early September conference just so you have a little bit of kind of tactical feel, but we generally think about 30 products or so that are out there that we offer.","And the performance measurement gets us at that level so we can target and grow kind of at that level.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot.","Eric Aboaf","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.","Vivek Juneja","Hi, Jay, Eric. I want to get back to the servicing fee question. So if you look at constant currency versus year to date, in 2Q you were running at about 5% growth year on year. Now, you're running, again, constant currency year to date about 4% and you said you're comfortable with that. So there's been a little bit of slowdown there. What is causing that? Is there something, can you give some color on that?","And what gets us to be - what's causing the slowdown and what gets us comfortable that it's staying at 4% and not going a little bit slower?","Eric Aboaf","Sure. Vivek, it's Eric. I think I just caution on individual quarters just like I would on individual months, because you got a fair number of small things going on. You got accruals, which are occasionally little lumpy. You've got new business that you install and which kind of has to tip in. You may have an old deal that is winding down that comes out. So - or a little - we just want to give a little caution to a particular quarter's results.","And if you think about the little lumpiness that you might get in one quarter, if that lumpiness went the other way in the previous quarter, then you kind of get a little more than you might expect, which is I think what happened this quarter, so just a little kind of cautionary note to take it in perspective.","In terms of why we had some confidence for the fourth quarter and the year is, we put aside new business pipelines, but we have a backlog of business that needs to be installed and when it gets installed, we begin to accrue for. We obviously have good visibility into that. And so, that's off of which we're doing some of our modeling and off of which we gave guidance for fourth quarter. And we think that will play through.","Vivek Juneja","So, Eric, keeping that in mind, do you think we're better off going back to where you were running first half of the year? Or is that too fine - cutting it too fine to go from where that's four or it's five or is there some kind of range in that - between those two?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah, I'd keep it in the range. This is a business that you win over quarters that become years, that become multiple years. You saw what year-on-year was 1Q, year-over-year 2Q, year-over-year 3Q. I think the year-to-date is a good indication and is our expectation for - is our expectation.","Vivek Juneja","And the FX swaps, Eric, for you, that you mentioned earlier that caused some of that impact on the deposit costs, was that because of the weakness in the dollar versus the pound or the euro or any color on that?","Eric Aboaf","No, the FX swaps and the reason why the FX swaps which are linked from an accounting standpoint to the deposit, cost more in the third quarter than the second quarter is because the interest rate differential, right, between U.S. markets and European markets. And so as the Fed moved, but the ECB did not move, the cost of the swap goes up. That said, when you invest in dollars you can invest at higher rates than you did in euros, and so it neutralizes, but the accounting shows it on two different lines.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, great. Thank you.","Eric Aboaf","Yeah.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","So now, you mentioned earlier that you were reducing the credit securities and adding direct loans. Can you just size what the ultimate goal is of that strategy and the timing of it as well?","Eric Aboaf","Sure, Brian, it's Eric. We're gliding the balance sheet. I think you saw us glide a bit on deposits in a very purposeful way and we think that that's accretive to ratios and for the annual stress tests. And then on the asset side, on the investment portfolio side, I think you've seen that we have a kind of broad diversified mix of securities. You've seen us adjust by about $2 billion, $3 billion this quarter.","And we have a capacity to continue to do some of that to the extent that we want to create room. I think if you step back, what we're trying to do here is optimize multiple ratios, right? Right now, tier 1 leverage is the binding constraint, since you see a lot of activity there. As tier 1 leverage becomes less of a binding constraint, then we have to think about the SLR constraint and the RWA constraint.","And what you see us do is in a kind of in a forward thinking way, begin to tailor the balance sheet for those as well. So I think I describe the investment portfolio as a modest adjustment. We have the capacity to do more because we have a little more of a high quality, credit-intensive portfolio than others. And if there's good client business to be done and we want to grow that a little more quickly, it's a natural part to say should we do both or should we offset a little bit.","I tell you, both changes are accretive on earnings and both are positive in our stress testing and so that's - that was some of the logic and something we'll continue to work on and refine.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And just a second question, yeah, I heard you mention the impacts of the sale of BlockCross on the processing fees, but didn't hear the dollar amount. Did you give the gains on that sale?","Eric Aboaf","Yeah, the pre-tax gain was just around $25 million and it's in one of the footnotes. The - what I will remind you is it's in processing fees, which this quarter we're $145 million. A year ago, processing fees were $139 million, so there is - that's the fee line where we have lots of small items. We have software fees. We have loan fees. We have BOLI. We have tax-advantaged investments. It's a little lumpy.","But - so BlockCross didn't have a significant move on a year on year basis. It does have a - it is, it does have a pre-tax effect in an absolute way in the current quarter though.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Good, thanks.","Operator","And there are no further questions. Are there any closing remarks?","Joseph Hooley","Yeah, just quickly, Victoria. Thanks everybody for your time. And good questions this morning and we look forward to getting together in January to discuss our fourth quarter results. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

Good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Our second quarter earnings materials include a slide presentation.

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street\u2019s 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC.

Any such forward looking statements speak only as of today, July 22, 2014. The corporation does not undertake to revise such forward looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Jay Hooley.","Jay Hooley","Thanks, Valerie and good morning everyone. Our strong second quarter results reflect growth in core servicing and management fee revenue driven by both, higher global equity markets and net new business.","With respect to our market driven revenues, we experienced a typical seasonal uplift in securities lending, as well as increased demand in our enhanced custody program which has been a driver to growth over the past few quarters. Additionally foreign exchange trading performed well with higher volumes in both direct and indirect trading execution methods despite extremely low volatility for the industry. And IR [ph] also performed a bit better than we expected due to a higher level of interest earning assets from new business and higher client deposits.","On the expense front, we continue to be focused on controlling expenses across the organization. While we continue to perform as we anticipate on operating expenses, we are experiencing increased pressure from regulatory compliance costs.","Now I would like to provide a brief economical view on review of the second quarter global equity market performance for trading environment and how our revenues were impacted. The U.S. economy bounced back solidly during the second quarter following a very weak first quarter, lower employment, increased household wealth and improved credit conditions are combining with a still very accommodative monetary policy to support an improving outlook for the U.S. economic recovery.","Global equity and fixed income market performance was strong during the second quarter. The S&P 500 daily average was up nearly 4%, the EAFE daily average was up 2.5%, and the Barclays U.S. aggregate index was up 2%. The Federal market committee\u2019s June policy statement affirmed that the economy was rebounding, and as such, an outset of Fed would continue tapering its asset purchases each month with a view towards ending them in the fourth quarter. We expect the Fed to leave administered interest rates unchanged at a very low level, direct of the year, and begin to gradually increase in the middle of next year.","The Euro zone continues to lead U.S. recovery in the remaining weak and uneven, even as rise in political attentions and a potential re-intensification of the debt crisis continue to present downside risk. With growth persistently weak and unemployment still extremely high, inflation is uncomfortably low and is expected to remain low for a prolonged period. Against this backdrop, the ECB took action in early June to ease its monetary policy stance. As widely anticipated it reduced administered interest rates, including a cut to the deposit facility rate paid on excess reserves to below zero. We\u2019re closely monitoring market conditions including market interest rates which have generally remained positive, SWOT markets, and client deposit behavior. On the positive side, EU [ph] continues to be the global growth it will reaccelerate over the next few years as growth picks up in advanced economies and stabilizes in developing economies.","With respect to the trading environment, State Street benefited from higher global equity markets. During the second quarter we saw an increase in investor risk appetite which was favorable to our asset mix. Clients increased allocations to both, emerging market and maturing market equities and reduced allocations to money market funds. As a result we saw a slight pickup in U.S. transaction volume, reversing a low transaction volume trend we saw over the last few quarters. Both dynamics were positive contributors to our servicing fee revenue.","As reflected in this quarter\u2019s results, we continue to see strong and steady demand for our products and services globally. Our second quarter 2014 new asset servicing wins totaled approximately $250 billion, representing a range of clients and sectors. 58% of those assets were from outside the U.S. which is an increase from prior quarters, perhaps signaling improved confidence in the global economic outlook, and a result of willingness of clients, particularly in Europe, to change service providers. Also included in our new business wins are 26 new alternative assets servicing mandates. New assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods totaled $243 billion and our current pipeline is strong.","In our asset management business, we experienced net inflows of $18 billion for the second quarter which was the best quarter of flows since the third quarter of 2012. The flows were driven primarily by net inflows of $10 billion into ETFs, $12 billion into institutional mandates, and money market funds of $1 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $5 billion from short-term collateral pools. We intend to build on this new business momentum for the rest of the year.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year.","Mike Bell","Thank you, Jay and good morning everyone. This morning, I\u2019ll start my review on slide 9. While we\u2019ve noted several financial highlights for the second quarter, and for the six months ended June 30 which I will refer to as year-to-date. Unless noted separately, we\u2019ll reference only the non-GAAP operating basis results in my comments today.","By wins summary, second quarter results were improved in what remained a challenging operating environment. We plan to continue to focus on our top priorities, driving core revenue growth, investing in growth opportunities, controlling expenses and managing our strong capital position. Regarding the first half of 2014 EPS increased approximately 8% from the first six months of 2013. Year-to-date however revenue increased approximately 4% compared to the year ago period. Importantly, year-to-date core servicing and management fee revenue increased approximately 7% compared to the same period in 2013, primarily reflecting the benefits of higher equity markets, net new business, and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar.","EPS for the second quarter 2014 increased to $1.39 per share from $0.99 from the first quarter of 2014, and from $1.24 in the second quarter of 2013. As a reminder, our first quarter 2014 results included the seasonal affect of $146 billion of deferred incentive compensation expense for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. Second quarter results also reflect the seasonal increase in our securities finance business that typically occurs in the second quarter. Compared to the second quarter of 2013 the increase in EPS was primarily due to a strong increase in core servicing and management fees, a lower operating basis tax rate, and the impact of our share repurchase program. These positives were partially offset by lower market driven revenues and higher expenses.","Compared to the second quarter of 2013, total expenses increased approximately 4% primarily due to the higher compensation and regulatory compliance costs, including the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Our second quarter 2014 pretax profit margin was 32%, down slightly from the second quarter of 2013. The operating basis effective tax rate was lower than normal this quarter due to some one-time items. We do expect a higher operating basis tax rate in the second half of the year.","Turning to slide 12, I\u2019ll provide additional details of our operating basis revenue for the second quarter of 2014 primarily focusing on the notable variances to the second quarter of 2013. Second quarter 2014 servicing fees performed very well, up approximately 7% compared to the second quarter of 2013. The increase primarily reflects stronger global equity markets, net new business, and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Second quarter asset management fees increased 8% from the second quarter of 2013, primarily due to stronger global equity markets. Money market fee waivers were $10 million in the second quarter, flat with the first quarter and up from $8 million in the second quarter of last year.","Trading services revenue increased modestly compared to the first quarter, primarily due to higher foreign exchange trading revenue as a result of higher volumes, partially offset by lower volatility. Compared to the second quarter of 2013, trading revenue was lower primarily due to lower FX volatility. Compared to the second quarter of 2013 securities finance revenue increased primarily due to new business and enhanced custody. Enhanced custody represented 25% of our second quarter securities finance revenue and more than 100% of the growth compared to the prior year quarter. Enhanced custody also benefited from the seasonal increase in our securities finance business.","Processing fees and other revenue increased from the second quarter of 2013, including higher revenue associated with our tax-advantaged investments. Our net interest revenue decreased from the second quarter of 2013 primarily due to lower yields on interest earning assets, partially offset by lower interest expense and a higher level of interest earnings assets. Average interest earnings assets increased from the first quarter, primarily driven by a higher level of client deposits. In addition, year-to-date net interest revenue has benefited from higher short-term Euro market rates than we had expected. Offsetting these positive factors and placing pressure on net interest revenue are factors that include the sustained low interest rate environment, the recent reduction in Euro market interest rates, and our portfolio\u2019s reinvestment in the higher quality liquid assets to meet the new liquidity requirements.","The many of you have had questions regarding the impact of the European Central Bank lowering the open deposit rate to negative 10 basis points and the related impact on our deposit pricing. While overnight rates have come down since the June 5 announcement which is placing pressure on our net interest revenue, market rate still remains slightly positive. We continue to evaluate our options and are monitoring the actions of other market participants. Based upon our current assessment of market conditions, we now expect full year 2014 operating basis net interest revenue to be in the range of $2.25 billion to $2.28 billion assuming the client deposits and market interest rates continue at second quarter levels through the remainder of the year.","Now let\u2019s turn to operating basis expenses on slide 13. Our second quarter 2014 compensation and employee benefits expenses increased approximately 6% from the second quarter of 2013 due to new business support, higher incentive compensation, the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, annual merit increases, and higher regulatory compliance costs, partially offset by savings associated with the Business Ops and IT program.","Information systems and communication expenses increased from second quarter 2013 due to higher infrastructure costs. Transaction processing expenses increased from the second quarter 2013 reflecting higher volumes and higher equity values in the investment servicing business. Occupancy expenses of $115 million increased compared to the year ago quarter. Occupancy expenses in the second quarter 2014 included a one-time recovery of $5 million. Compared to the second quarter of 2013, other expenses decreased 3% primarily due to a $9 million credit associated with Lehman Brothers-related recoveries in the second quarter of 2014, and lower legal and sales promotion expenses, partially offset by higher regulatory compliance expenses.","Now I\u2019ll provide you with some details on our June 30, 2014 balance sheet. As you can see on slide 14, our overall approach to managing our investment portfolio has not changed and we have maintained a high credit quality profile. Our interest rate risk position was also in line with our position at last quarter. Additionally, the after-tax unrealized mark-to-market gain as of June 30, was $456 million, which improved from last quarter, primarily due to narrower spreads and a decline in longer term interest rates in the second quarter. And I will turn to the next slide to review your capital position.","As you can see we maintained a strong capital position and that strength has allowed us to deliver on our key priority of returning value to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. As we have previously announced, we completed our Basel III qualification period, our parallel run in the first quarter this year. As a result, beginning with this quarter, we are now calculating and disclosing our actual regulatory capital ratios under the advanced approach framework of the Basel III final rule. As of June 30, 2014 our Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III advanced approach was 12.8%. Under the Basel III standardized approach, which will not go into effect until 2015, our estimated pro forma Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 11.3%. We estimate that our pro forma Basel III supplemental leverage ratios under our interpretation of the U.S. proposed rules issued on April 8 are approximately 6.1% at the holding company and approximately 5.8% of the bank as of June 30, 2014. These leverage ratios about the holding company and the bank are down slightly from last quarter due primarily to an increase in average assets from higher client deposits.","As we continue to focus on returning capital to our shareholders, during the second quarter of 2014 we purchased approximately 6.3 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately $410 million, resulting in average fully diluted common shares outstanding of approximately $435 million for the quarter. As of June 30, 2014, we had approximately $1.3 billion remaining on our current common stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1.7 billion of our common stock for March 31, 2015.","Now before I wrap up my comments, I would like to review our current outlook for the remainder of 2014. For revenues, our results this quarter include the positive effect of the foreign dividend season which significantly benefited securities finance revenues. We expect both agency securities lending and enhanced custody revenue to revert to lower levels in the third quarter due to the end of the seasonal activity. In addition, from my earlier remarks, we expect net interest revenue in the second half of 2014 to be below the first half of the year due to current market conditions.","Overall, for the full year 2014, we continue to target 3% to 5% revenue growth compared to full year 2013. I\u2019d now like to address a question which I suspect is on investors and analysts minds, which is the outlook for operating leverage. Due to expense pressure from regulatory compliance, it will be more challenging for us to achieve our goal or positive operating leverage for 2014 unless we experience an improvement in multi-driven revenues. Specifically, it\u2019s important to highlight that regulatory expectations for GSAB like State Street have continued to increase. Importantly, it\u2019s not just related to compliance with new rules, it\u2019s across all areas of the company, including list data aggregation and reporting, mismanagement and governance, recovery and resolution planning, client onbaording and transaction monitoring systems and documentation requirements. The amount of effort to fully comply with these expectations is higher than what we previously expected. As a result, we currently expect 2014 regulatory costs to be higher than our earlier expectations.","In the meantime, we continue to focus on managing other elements of our expense base to offset some of the impact of the higher regulatory expenses, this includes continuing to execute on the severance program announced in first quarter. In aggregate, we currently estimate that our operating expenses for the third quarter of 2014 will be approximately $20 million higher than the second quarter levels, primarily reflecting increased regulatory costs offset to some extent by other savings. We also currently expect fourth quarter expenses to be approximately in line with third quarter expenses.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Jay.","Jay Hooley","Thanks, Mike. And Stephanie we\u2019re now available to answer questions. So you might open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. Hey, good morning guys.","Jay Hooley","Good morning.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So first question on expenses. I guess what\u2019s changed since the prior \u2013 I mean, what did you guys learn over the course of the quarter that led you to believe that expenses on regulation will exceed that kind of the $40 million number that you provided in the past? And then secondly, I guess more importantly the question I think a lot of investors will have is, once you get through this how should we think about these level of expenses heading into 2015; i.e., is this a catch-up bet for whatever reason that you guys didn\u2019t really anticipate in the past and not just a ramp that we\u2019re seeing this year. And then we\u2019ll see some easing into 2015 or how should we think I guess about expenses on regulation beyond this current period?","Mike Bell","Alex, it\u2019s Mike, I\u2019ll start regarding your question around 2014. The main thing that is different from what we talked about say at the Investor Day \u2013 it\u2019s now clear to us that expectations, really across the board by all regulators are higher than what we had previously anticipated. And, just as a reminder, I mean \u2013 we are a global company obviously, and what we have found is that expectations across the globe are higher for GSABs [ph] than we had previously anticipated and it\u2019s really very important to us Alex that we maintain good relationships with our regulators, particularly with the Fed, and we think at this point, it\u2019s prudent to plan to spend more resources than we had originally budgeted here for 2014. I mean as it relates to 2015, I think that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a little early to try to comment on that. Obviously, as we get closer to the end of the year, we might have some additional updates, but at this point I don\u2019t see any indication that the expectations are going to wretched back, but again, I wouldn\u2019t try to comment on spending at this point.","Jay Hooley","Alex, let me just add just a comment on the longer term outlook \u2013 call it 2015 or whatever. With regard to regulatory compliance expectations, be it capital, be it liquidity, be it any other number of things that we\u2019re focused on; we\u2019ve organized internally to make sure that we not only comply with but also get organized around aggregating data, sources internally so that we create something that\u2019s sustainable and overtime I would expect that the cost would ramp down. Now there is an effort to get things organized and effective but efficiency is also a friend of mine for instance we go through this process.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Understood, thanks for that. And my second question is just around the balance sheet. When I look at the balances, big \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the similar trend with the other trusted banks this quarter as well. I guess, how sticky [ph] do you think these are \u2013 I mean it looks like a lot of it actually came from \u2013 in the U.S. side, so maybe you can talk a little bit to the sources of this excess cash, it just kind of keeps coming in. And then if you guys given any thought to potentially reposition the balance sheet and buy in some securities with all those excess cash that\u2019s sitting on in with the Fed right now.","Mike Bell","Sure. Alex, this is Mike, I will start. You\u2019re absolutely right that we did see a significant increase in client deposits in Q2 relative to Q1. Unfortunately, most of that is in really the category of excess deposit, so we estimate that there was approximately 50% increase in excess deposits from Q2 relative to Q1 on average for the quarter. And our policy is basically to take excess deposits and place them with the central bank. So at this point there hasn\u2019t been any change in our philosophy and we don\u2019t think it would be prudent to turnaround and invest those excess deposits and longer term securities at this point. But again, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re monitoring, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re very cognizant of \u2013 particularly as it relates to the new liquidity coverage ratio requirements which will be effective January 1, 2015. So, more information to come there.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Understood, thanks so much.","Mike Bell","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","Hi, good morning everyone. Mike, can you elaborate a little bit more on the offsets against the higher compliance costs. First of all, just relative to that, up 30 to up 40, can you size what the new increased expectation is? And then, do you also have plans to \u2013 given that this isn\u2019t different versus original expectation, are there plans to offset those costs in either salaries, incentive compensation plans for management or other parts of the business?","Mike Bell","Sure, Ken. First \u2013 let me talk first about the $20 million increase that we expect, Q3 relative to Q2, and then when we come back to the first part of your question. First, I\u2019d emphasize Ken that the $20 million is obviously a current estimate so it\u2019s subject to change, and it\u2019s subject to some one-offs, some of our expenses, either plus or minus can be lumpy. But with that caveat out of the way, I\u2019d point to several pluses and minuses in Q2 just along the lines of what you were alluding to. First of all, the \u2013 we did have $14 million of expense recoveries in Q2 that dampened our overall aggregate expenses in Q2 that we don\u2019t expect to recur in Q3, so that was $14 million. We also have an extra payroll day in both, in Q3 relative to Q2 and that end up \u2013 we had the same number of payroll days in Q4 and Q3. So \u2013 but it is an increment of approximately $5 million going from Q2 to Q3.","Then the other pluses and minuses that I would highlight here, first, as we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect that regulatory compliance costs will be higher in Q3 than Q2. We also anticipate that we\u2019ll continue to have net new business over the course of Q3 that will likely require some expense to service that revenue. And then importantly, we\u2019ve got a couple of areas of offset, we\u2019ve got the savings Ken from the Q1 severance actions that we took, and again we expect a large amount of those savings to come in Q3. And then, we\u2019re also looking at some other savings opportunities along the lines of what you described, and that could include redeploying existing resources to the regulatory compliance areas so that it\u2019s not incremental expense, it\u2019s just a redeployment of existing resources, we\u2019re working hard at that. As you mentioned, the management incentive comp \u2013 unfortunately adjust automatically for the higher expenses so that that will represent some partial offset as well.","So basically, that \u2013 those are the pluses and minuses that we\u2019re really focused on as it relates to Q3 and Q2. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019d expect Q4 to be in line approximately with Q3 as being our current outlook. On your question on the overall level of regulatory compliance expenses, we are in the process \u2013 kind of working through those detailed plans, and I don\u2019t know that it would be very meaningful to you to give you an updated number, I think it would denote [ph] false precision and since we are reviewing the opportunities to redeploy existing staff, the gross amount of spending would not be the amount that I would expect to fall to the bottom line. So I think the more meaningful number would be to focus on the plus 20 sequentially.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. And Mike, my second question is with regards to LCR compliance, can you tell us where you are? You had earlier in the year mentioned considering making changes \u2013 potential changes to the way that the balance sheet is structured and your investments are \u2013 where you\u2019re investments are heading. So you can just talk to us about LCR compliance and any anticipated changes to that?","Mike Bell","Yes. So Ken, first of all, at the end of Q2 we estimate that we would have been in compliance with the new requirements for LCR level one [ph] 2015, and that was the result of diverting more of our assets on our balance sheet to the level one high quality liquid assets that were required. Now I would anticipate that there will be a little more migration in the second half of the year to a higher level of level one\u2019s and so therefore there is a little bit more dampening of NIR coming in the second half of the year, but that was reflected in the NIR estimates that I gave you for the full year.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, I\u2019ve got it. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Hi, thanks. On the \u2013 obviously, you have the DVARB [ph] season driving the securities on loan balances higher and producing the seasonality in the quarter. Is there anything else in there that helps drive the revenue be it like better spreads, higher interest and hard to borrows, or anything like that?","Mike Bell","Glenn, its Mike. A couple of other things helped us out here in Q2 that I would highlight. First of all, in terms of the core servicing fees, we benefited from a couple of things that Jay emphasized in his prepared remarks. First, we did see a sequential increase in transaction revenues of approximately $5 million, Q2 versus Q1. And so that was a welcome change from the decrease that we had seen in the prior quarter, and \u2013 again, there are several moving parts there but we think some of that reflects the fact that there was some index rebalancing that took place in second quarter which again led to our clients generating more transactions. So that helped us.","And then the other one was the change in the mix of flows. We saw some additional risk on behavior in Q2 relative to Q1, specifically with some cyclical rotation, back into emerging markets which was a welcome change. And then beyond core servicing fees, as I said in my prepared remarks Glenn, the \u2013 we did benefit from short-term market rates being higher than we had anticipated for the first half of the year in Europe, unfortunately that abruptly changed here in the early June with the ECB action. So \u2013 but the bottom line is, we got some benefit from first half of the year in IR that we don\u2019t expect to repeat. And I would think of that as sequentially Q2 to Q3, us losing approximately $10 million of NIR with the change in the European conditions, those would be the ones that come to mind.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Okay, I appreciate that. I was trying to get towards that but this will be a bigger sequential drop than normally just because of the bigger sequential output.","Jay Hooley","Let me pick that up \u2013 so, in securities lending, is that was your\u2026","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Correct.","Jay Hooley","Comments were focused. Let me just describe what the quarter looked like and then we can talk through the second quarter, third quarter transition. Spreads were less than a factor, the level of M&A has helped the specials within securities lending but the overwhelming biggest factor in \u2013 other than the seasonality of the dividend season was the enhanced custody which is kind of the alternative direct to hedge fund lending program that we invaded couple of years ago and continue to invest in, we\u2019re starting to globalize that, moving that to Europe and Asia, is our current plan. Mike referenced in his remarks, it was 25% of our revenue in the second quarter and most of the uptake. So I would expect that we would see the drop of second quarter and third quarter but enhanced custody is a factor in us \u2013 what I believe is gaining market share in the overall securities lending business.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","I appreciate the extra color Jay.","Jay Hooley","Thanks.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","On the \u2013 I know we want to look at expenses in aggregate but can\u2019t particularly \u2013 you called out some stuff last quarter like the merit increases but we\u2019re looking at 6% year-on-year for the quarter, maybe something more like 8% or 9% for the first six months, honestly doesn\u2019t match up with what we\u2019ve seen on the revenue side but to your point, the fee businesses are growing, the assets are growing. Just \u2013 I guess, the question is, how do you balance all that because it speaks out to all of us when we rip in through the numbers and contributing to the lack of operating leverage?","Mike Bell","Sure, Glenn. I mean you\u2019re absolutely right in terms of year-over-year \u2013 the items that you described certainly have had a impact. I mean specifically, if we look at Q2 2014 versus Q2 2013, in terms of comp and benefits, you know first and foremost, I would highlight the fact that we have had growth in the quarter fee business and therefore, we\u2019re in the service business that requires additional expense to service that higher revenue. And then the other items or the items that we\u2019ve talked about previously which is, we did have a merit increase, saw that kicked in April 1, up 3%. We did have higher deferred management comp this year versus what we had a year ago because the performance year that we had in full year 2013 was higher than the performance we had in full year 2012 which meant that the deferred comp awards that were granted earlier in 2014 were higher. And then as we talked about last quarter and also at the Investor Day, we\u2019ve had higher regulatory compliance expenses, some of that has manifested itself in higher staff clause, and also then in the other operating expenses around consulting expenses.","And then, the final thing I would highlight Glenn would be the growth initiatives that we highlighted at the Investor Day, those continue to be key priorities for us. I\u2019d point to something like enhanced custody where \u2013 it was a good thing that we invested in enhanced custody last few years because that\u2019s been more than 100% of the year-over-year growth in securities finance revenues. And so, not every initiative will be a success like enhanced custody but the point is, it is important for us to invest in these growth initiatives, so we\u2019ve remained innovative in terms of the value added services.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee \u2013 KBW","Thanks, good morning. Can you \u2013 maybe Jay give us a little bit more color on the asset servicing lends, I mean how should we be thinking of that \u2013 maybe from a potential revenue impact? When you look at that anyway kind of sizing it or more of color on kind of \u2013 begin more of than the mix than how flow through revenues?","Jay Hooley","Yes, the $250 billion of which \u2013 we also said $243 I think was the number as yet to be installed. As the real mix got a little bit more of a non-U.S. tilt to it, it continues to be colored proportionally more on the alternative space and the traditional alternative hedge but also liquid off \u2013 we\u2019ve had a couple of nice wins that are factoring through the revenue line, things that we\u2019ve reported over the last several quarters. So I would characterize the quarter as a pretty strong quarter from a standpoint of new business committed. I\u2019d also characterize the outlook from a pipeline standpoint as a strong \u2013 and probably stronger than it\u2019s been in a while and a little bit more with an international spend to it. When you look at the translation into the service fee line model, I thought I was pleased with the second quarter service fee growth and it \u2013 you know, it factors in obviously the equity markets, the \u2013 pretty positive re-risking environment from the customer standpoint and this layering in of the new business. So, I think if anything tremblized a little more positive than we\u2019ve seen from the standpoint of the quarter\u2019s results and the outlook from the pipeline standpoint.","Robert Lee \u2013 KBW","Okay, great. And then maybe just as a follow-up, just a little \u2013 maybe a little bit of modeling question. But the tax rate in the quarter was a little low and I apologize if you addressed this before, but \u2013 and I know the guidance is that all, kind of comeback I think in the second half of the year. Can you maybe talk about what simply drove the lower tax rate in the quarter?","Mike Bell","Sure, Rob. There are two primary items that impacted the Q2 operating tax rate. The first is that we did have some favorable settlements related to prior year tax returns, so that helped us in the quarter. And then the other factor that helped us in the quarter is that the Q2 operating tax rate is impacted by the rules \u2013 the accounting rules that govern the quarterly timing of the recognition of our tax advantaged investments. And so the net impact of that was that the Q2 rate was lower than what we estimate for the full year average, but we expect the second half of the year operating tax rate to be higher than that full year average. So that was the cause of the temporary favorable in Q2.","Robert Lee \u2013 KBW","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks, good morning.","Jay Hooley","Good morning.","Brian Bedell \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Just \u2013 maybe Jay, just to go back to the servicing line \u2013 and thanks Mike for outlining the transaction impact. Can you also outline that the U.S. or the impact from these U.S. dollar weakening \u2013 and then Jay, if you can talk about to what degree are you seeing the next shift of new business, so \u2013 into alternative, helping that core fee ratio. Should we be thinking about that as an improvement in the core fee rate going forward, given you\u2019re seeing more assets in that area [ph]?","Jay Hooley","Yes, I\u2019ll start and then Mike can pick up to currency effect. I think \u2013 to your question Brian, I think the bigger factor in the quarter with regard to the nice uptick and service fees was probably the asset mix, the re-risking from a client standpoint. I would say that the new business layering in, it\u2019s hard to characterize any meaningful difference. I think alternatives have been a theme for several quarters and as I spend time in the marketplace, it\u2019s pretty clear to me that there is a converges going on between the traditional loan only managers that are getting into all, liquid all, and the alternate managers going downstream until the traditional distribution channels. So, I would say if there was a sweet spot, prospectively that would be the sweet spot. It\u2019s alternative is moving into the traditional, the traditional moving into liquids, more of a U.S. and Europe phenomenon but growing in Asia as well. And if you believe that story, I would think that we\u2019re well positioned for that given the work we\u2019ve done on alternatives and given the penetration we have in the traditional asset management space where the liquid also being generated.","Mike Bell","And so Brain, it\u2019s Mike. Regarding your factual question on the FX impact on GS revenue, we estimate Brain that on a year-over-year basis, so Q2 2014 versus Q2 2013, it helped us by about a percentage point, so specifically about $11 million of benefit in that year-over-year comparison on $1.2 billion of revenue. And then the sequential quarter was much smaller, it was approximately $3 million benefit in the Q2 versus Q1 comparison for GS revenue.","Brian Bedell \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. And listening both of your comments it sounds like we have some sustainability but basically \u2013 principally on the re-risking more than anything \u2013","Jay Hooley","That\u2019s \u2013 I mean that your business commitment, pipeline, and re-risking are the three real pluses in my mind in the quarter.","Brian Bedell \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yes, great, thanks for that. And then, just my follow-up question would be, you were talking about sort of the market environment for generating positive operating leverage in the second half. If you can mainly characterize what type of market environment do you think you would need to do that?","Mike Bell","Sure, Brain. So \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s been a challenging first half of the year, on the other hand we continue to believe that our full year expectation is for revenue growth of 3% to 5% and as I said, the first half of the year it\u2019s been 4% on a year-to-date basis but we benefited by about a point from the weaker U.S. dollar on a year-to-date basis, we\u2019ll call it 3% on a constant currency basis. And then the mix has not been particularly helpful regarding operating leverage, the core revenues, the core servicing fees and management fees are up approximately 7% versus a year ago but the market driven revenues where we have the highest profit margins have actually been down year-over-year. So that mix has put pressure on us in addition to the fact that we have been at the lower end of that 3% to 5% range on a constant currency basis. And then on top of that as I said in my prepared remarks, the operating expenses, we\u2019ve got some additional pressure there because of the regulatory expectations. So the bottom line Brain is, we would need to see a year-over-year increase in the market driven revenues and in particular, the \u2013 some rebound in FX volatility and some help from our market interest rates in all likelihood to be able to achieve that result.","Brian Bedell \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. So if we just assume your current NIR forecast for example, maybe isolating that, is it fair to say that we would need to see an improvement in FX volatility to some extent and then a continued improvement in the equity market levels and continued pace of re-risking, and that\u2019s what you would describe as a positive environment?","Mike Bell","Yes, I think it\u2019s there [ph].","Brian Bedell \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","I think last quarter you pointed a processing fees of $125 million to $135 million per quarter, and then you were below that this quarter and it looks like you also restated the first quarter result. So, maybe if you could review the moving parts with the taxable equivalent adjustment and update us on your expectations there?","Mike Bell","Okay, sure Luke. So, first of all we did have a product reclass, specifically we provide a currency management service to our transition management clients and that revenue of $13 million in the quarter was reclassed out of processing in other and into the trading services line item. So if you added back that $13 million, then we initiate [ph] the processing fees in other would have been rate in line with what we had talked about previously. So it was that product reclass, it just moves revenue from one bucket to other that caused the lower reported number in the processing fees and other line. In terms of your question on the outwork for processing fees and other, we do expect that the second half of the year will have a higher tax equivalent adjustment, particularly driven by a higher volume of tax investments than what we had in the first half of the year. So including the higher tax equivalent adjustment in the second half of the year I would anticipate that processing fees and other would be in a range of \u2013 call it 1.15 to 1.20 for the third quarter, again that\u2019s subject to change, obviously with different one-offs, but that would that kind of range that I\u2019m currently thinking at this point.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay, very helpful. And then, I wondered if you could comment on the proposal around brokerage commission sharing agreements which the regulators are calling inducements, how do you anticipate that might affect your European operations, either in your capacity to broke or \u2013 or in the investment management side of the business?","Jay Hooley","Well Luke, this is Jay, I\u2019m not sure I can answer that one. I\u2019m roughly familiar with reclaim [ph] and it shouldn\u2019t have a big effect on any brokerage because that\u2019s something we don\u2019t do directly, probably I\u2019ll have to come back to you on that.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay, fair enough. And then, I just wanted to circle back on the regulatory spending commentary. I mean, it seems like you began communicating this pressure a little bit later than other trust banks and so many assets managers, at least one of them is that peak spending now. So, I don\u2019t mean to just not comparative but a skeptic maybe could be a little bit later at the timing here given that you were the only one of your peers last year that posted material operating leverage and beat expectations. So maybe you could just comment on why there seems to be a delayed effect in your case and why you relied on recognizing the need to increase that spending?","Jay Hooley","I can\u2019t speak Luke to other folk\u2019s representations. It\u2019s pretty clear to me that regulatory expectations are moving targets. I think that whether it\u2019s capital, liquidity, different levels of reporting that are required; the bar gets raised all the time. And so, I think for somebody today to say that the regulatory expenses has topped out or peaked, that sees inconsistent to me with what I\u2019m hearing from regulators. So, I think from our standpoint we are addressing the requirements and trying to do it in a way that\u2019s durable and sustainable and looks at building internal data models so that we can aggregate information more easily and fluently going forward. So we\u2019re trying to put in place an infrastructure that can continue to respond to what I believe will be an ongoing and increasingly challenging level of regulatory requirements. So, for us we\u2019ve been focused on this all along, and we\u2019re continuing to focus on it. I can\u2019t speak to what others point of view is on this.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay, thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning. Mike, going back to the LCR, are you able to size what the revenue drag was this year? And just for a context, where were you at the beginning of the year and in terms of being comply for 2015, do you mean 80% or higher?","Mike Bell","Okay, so actually several questions there. First of all I do anticipate that we\u2019ll be well higher, well north of 80% at year end. And again, we estimate that we\u2019re north of 80% here at Q2. So \u2013 again, our expectation is not to be close to that 80% minimum line but instead to really demonstrate that we have ample liquidity, relative to the Fed expectations in particular. And in terms of sizing it \u2013 surround numbers by the time we get to the end of the year, I would anticipate that the higher level of high quality liquid assets represents a drag of approximately $10 million a quarter for Q4 2014 relative to what we might have been pro forma without that higher level of Level One high quality liquid assets.","Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. So when we think about 2015 we should think about \u2013 maybe drag possibly half that size going forward or is that too aggressive?","Mike Bell","Serrao [ph], I think that\u2019s in the ballpark. I mean, again it\u2019s really early for us to be giving guidance around 2015 but I think you\u2019re sizing it approximately right, to the nearest half it would be about a half.","Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And then I had just a follow-up question on funding this quarter. The rate on other short-term borrowings was negative, any color there? This is supposed to reverse going forward?","Mike Bell","Sure. Ashley, the \u2013 what that really reflects is an accounting reclass, basically this relates to a block of newly assets and a product that we use for tax free money market funds. So specifically we hit an accounting reclass that pointed now the interest rate swap to the asset side of the balance sheet rather than the liability side as indicated on the average rates page. So specifically, if you looked up at that state in political sub divisions, line item, you can see that that went down for the quarter and that\u2019s the accounting reclass where the impact of two quarters were \u2013 of this interest rate swap got reflected in Q2 in that line item. So I would expect in all other things equal that Q3 to jump higher than the 3.3%, something closer to call it the high three\u2019s in Q3 as the accounting reclass \u2013 disproportionate impact in Q2 gets changed. And that had been an equal offset to the other short-term borrowing rate. So I would anticipate the other short-term borrowing rate in Q3 to be something just north of zero, it would be sort of the average 1.57% in Q1 and a negative 1.2% in Q2, it would be something \u2013 about a small positive in Q3.","Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse","Alright, thanks for the color there. And just \u2013 moving onto sec lending and enhanced custody offering, it seems to be gaining a lot of fraction. I was just curious who is your incremental customer there today, is it just \u2013 are they switching just from the AGC program that you have? And how do you envision your competitors responding to this because this is pretty impressive growth that you\u2019re putting on?","Jay Hooley","Yes, Ashley, let me take that. So I think we all know how this works. The \u2013 as opposed to lending securities to a prime broker who might lend them on to a hedge fund, we\u2019re lending securities directly to the hedge fund on a book entry basis so there is less folks in the chain, more efficient process, attractive from a hedge fund standpoint. So most of the activity would be bypassing the client broker I think is probably a fair way to look at it, and interestingly, I think many of the prime brokers out there are evaluating with the backdrop of the new capital requirements, how much and what type of prime broking they are looking to do. So it seems like we\u2019ve hit the market at a good juncture.","Competitively, we were way out ahead of this, we were working on this for three or four years, and the last couple of years it\u2019s really started to hit its stride. So, the traditional competitors are focused on it but quite a way is behind. I also might add that our deep penetration in the alternative servicing marketplace positions us ideally for this because we\u2019re dealing with those kind of prioritize [ph] hedge funds, and even the liquid \u2013 place or the low leverage 1.30 funds are also used as of this enhanced custody. So that\u2019s gives you a little color on how it came to be and what the competitive landscape looks like.","Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse","Alright, great. Thanks for all the color, and thanks for taking my questions.","Jay Hooley","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CAS [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, I have two questions, one easier and one, I think harder. But the easier question is, why did the balance sheet grow as much as it did, up $20 billion? And the difference between period end assets $280 billion versus average assets $235 billion, I mean those are big numbers, so is that risk-off? Is that a bunch of client wins or some other change, and do you think those funds will be sticky?","Mike Bell","Mike, it\u2019s Mike. First of all, as we noted in our prepared remarks, the vast bulk of that balance sheet growth, Q2 versus Q1 was in fact an increase in excess deposit, so we estimated that the excess deposits were up, approximately 50% or $14 billion Q2 versus Q1, and that\u2019s on average for the quarter. On your question on the spike at the very end of the quarter, again, we have seen that, the Trust banks have seen that pretty consistently, really over the last year where as funds are looking for a Safe Haven at the quarter end reporting date, we\u2019ve been treated as that Safe Haven. I don\u2019t anticipate that the spike that we saw at June 30 is a [indiscernible] of things to come here in Q3. I would note that the vast bulk of those excess deposits left at the beginning of July just as we\u2019ve seen in prior quarter ends, and in terms of the excess deposits that we have, even on average for the quarter \u2013 we would anticipate that the majority of those excess deposits would likely move to a different place as short-term interest rates go up. Obviously we haven\u2019t tested that hypothesis yet because short-term interest rates have been particularly sticky and particularly well.","Unidentified Analyst","And then my other question relates to \u2013 how much is the negative operating leverage for 2014, a statement on statutory [ph] versus the environment? It\u2019s been 3.5 years since you had the IT and Ops program and 3.5 years later we\u2019re hearing negative operating leverage. In your defense that I\u2019ve heard you say is, look interest rates are lower if longer that hurts NII, the regulatory environment is tough for that hurts the expenses. On the other hand, I note that headcount is kind of flat year-over-year, at least in the first quarter at 29,500, and I\u2019m just wondering how much you have left of $575 million to $625 million of savings?","Mike Bell","Mike, on that last question, we do anticipate the \u2013 getting the stub expense saves of $50 million in 2015 as we fully capture the rest of the run rate from IT and Ops translation. The other headwind that you didn\u2019t mention that I would add has been FX volatility, I mean FX volatility is at historic lows, that has certainly been fund helpful to us in terms of ability to generate favorable operating leverage because as we talked about the Investor Day, since market driven revenues like FX and like NIR are our highest margin revenues and it\u2019s tough to generate positive operating leverage in that current environment.","Unidentified Analyst","So how much have you actually achieved of the IT and Ops of the $575 million?","Mike Bell","In terms of the run rate, we\u2019ve achieved on a run rate basis for the savings that we anticipated for 2014. So I \u2013 we\u2019ll obviously capture the saves in Q3 and Q4 but they are already in the Q2 run rate. So again, we anticipate the stub of $50 million in 2015 but at this point we\u2019ve achieved a run rate savings for 2014.","Jay Hooley","And Mike, I would just try to raise this up a level. The \u2013 you know, we\u2019ve had some success with operating leverage. We\u2019ve got a little bit of expense headwind that we talked about with regard to regulatory but if you look at \u2013 I\u2019d say a real positive as the service fee, management fee, and if you look at the sustained \u2013 that kind of recurring headwind, it\u2019s really the net interest revenue. I mean, if you look at the impact that has had on a Trust bank, as for us the percentage of revenue and the fact that that\u2019s been grinding down over the last couple of years. We really need a turn in that, volatility would help and then I look at the health of the core service fee line, and that makes me feel pretty good. So I think in that grinding down interest rate environment, we\u2019ve been as you\u2019ve pointed out, becoming more efficient, that doesn\u2019t go away, that\u2019s embedded into who we are. Little bit of help on the rate side and the volatility side would turn operating leverage pretty quick, we\u2019re trying to get there without that.","Unidentified Analyst","And then last follow-up, just \u2013 the headcount, it was 29,530 in the first quarter, what was it this quarter or if you don\u2019t have the exact number, how are you thinking about headcount because with all the initiatives that you\u2019ve undertaken it\u2019s hasn\u2019t really gone down.","Mike Bell","Mike, I don\u2019t have that headcount number rate at my finger tips but I think importantly, one of the things that we\u2019re looking at carefully is around the headcount for regulatory compliance costs, relative to that trade-off with outside consultant. So we\u2019re really trying to manage the overall velars [ph] as opposed to artificially trying to push the headcount number down which would likely show up as higher consulting expense.","Jay Hooley","The other thing I would say which I don\u2019t think we look for but I look at intensely internally is where that headcount is located, and it\u2019s been a steady migration of that headcount from higher cost locations to lower costs locations. So while the FTEs maybe the same, the cost per FTE is continuing to go down on a conscious basis.","Unidentified Analyst","And they keep one regulation, maybe that\u2019s the different stroke \u2013 and more in regulation and less elsewhere, maybe that\u2019s being masked?","Mike Bell","Yes, Mike, again I wouldn\u2019t try to give you a specific number at this point because again, I mean, we\u2019re \u2013 in effect virtually all of us are spending more time on regulations that are trying to do a precise analysis of the FTEs related to regulatory compliance, other than saying it certainly is up, I would not try to quantify that number, I think it be past precision.","Unidentified Analyst","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffery [ph] with Autonomous Research.","Unidentified Analyst","Hello. When you think about the Feds stuff in next year, how do you think the mechanism of tightening, whether it\u2019s raising interest of reserves, reverse repo rates, doing something else is going to impact customer behavior than NCL, balance sheet [ph]. Do you think it matters what option they go for?","Mike Bell","Sure, Jeffery, it\u2019s Mike. First, we do expect that we may see some Fed tightening next year which ideally would lead to higher short-term interest rates, that certainly has the potential to help out our net interest revenue for next year. In that kind of situation as I said earlier, we do anticipate that perhaps a large chunk of the excess deposits that we had on our balance sheet at Q2 would migrate off the balance sheet and find a different home. And while there would be a small negative impact from that in IR, I would remind you that we\u2019re only earning approximately 20 basis points of net interest margin on those access deposits, so that impact I would expect to be manageable and probably more than offset by the favorable impact of an increase in short-term market interest rates. And of course, longer term Jeffery, that\u2019s also helpful \u2013 some shrinkage in the excess deposit is also helpful in terms of managing our capital ratio. So again, net-net I would view that as a positive impact if that happens in 2015.","Jay Hooley","I think there \u2013 it\u2019s an insightful question because you\u2019ve heard from the Fed \u2013 I think they signaled pretty clearly that it could be different this time around with regards to using other tools other than just rate tightening, paying more in excess deposits, using repo. I mean, I think Mike\u2019s right which is \u2013 as rates go up, funds will find better uses for their excess deposits than State Street. On the other hand there is a point at which if the Fed increases the rate that they pay in excess deposits, it will depend on where overall rates are, that could be a real positive for us if given the excess deposits we\u2019re holding if the rates go up on that.","Unidentified Analyst","And then how does those deposits are actually seeing impact on LCR, is there any impact or is it just a wash because you lose the high liquid assets or those deposits are assumed to go out anyway under the LCR calculation?","Mike Bell","Yes, we would expect that to be a wash Jeffery because as you said, the excess deposits are assumed to run-off at 100% in the calculation.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America.","Cynthia Mayer \u2013 Bank of America","Hi, thanks a lot. You mentioned some costs associated with installing net new business in 3Q and I\u2019m just wondering is that more than normal and why you would call that out. And I guess bigger picture question is, do some types of wins like alternatives require more upfront costs than others, and what is your mix shift mean for your upfront costs of installation?","Jay Hooley","I think to the first question Cynthia, we always call it out, I think the nature of \u2013 I think what Mike was getting at is the nature of, when the revenue is driven by service fees it comes with certain amount of cost, generally implemented at business but supported on an online basis. With regard to the amount of upfront cost, it really is probably less relevant to \u2013 whether it\u2019s a traditional alternative or a pension fund and more related to the size, sophistication, or the implementation itself \u2013 I would say in a more simplified traditional implementation is called a quarter \u2013 a two quarter which is probably 70% of the new business. This tends not to be an extraordinary upfront \u2013 there is some lead expense. In that 30% where you have large sophisticated multi-jurisdictional implementations, DFA comes to mind, most recently \u2013 there is a little bit more upfront cost which would precede the implementation.","Cynthia Mayer \u2013 Bank of America","Okay, great. And then, more big picture question on regulatory costs. I think \u2013 way back when you guys used to talk about regulatory pressures as also a business opportunity because you\u2019re clients are seeing it too, and it seems like the commentary has really shifted too. You guys are getting hit by a lot of regulatory costs but we\u2019re not hearing so much about whether you\u2019re still seeing it as a business opportunity for your clients. I mean just wondering, are you still seeing it as an opportunity or is it the type of regulatory costs that are just really different lawyers [ph] etcetera from the type of services you provide. Do you still see that as an opportunity?","Jay Hooley","Yes, absolutely Cynthia. And in fact, I would summarize that the banks are ahead of the investment managers in the pension funds with regard to what I call a regulatory tsunami that\u2019s coming. But when you look at our investor services business that have requirements for risk management, for compliance, for reporting, for data aggregation, it is extreme. We organize in the last year a new set of activities under what we call global exchange which is designed to focus on that opportunity and it\u2019s been very active. Customers in the investment management and the asset owner segment are really struggling with their ability to get their arms around that data that feed compliance regulatory risk management system. So, I would say the opportunity is ever present and it\u2019s probably bigger prospectively because of this lag effect of banks that are being first through the pipe here.","Cynthia Mayer \u2013 Bank of America","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Hey, good morning. I\u2019m just going to dive a little bit more into the custody fees. I think the sequential improvement was \u2013 or is the biggest we\u2019ve seen since the end of 2012, you highlighted the increased activity levels being about $5 million but the rest seemed to be from new business wins in market. Can you give us a little bit more \u2013 I think here you\u2019ve highlighted emerging markets as a big driver on the downside in the fee rate, it seems like we\u2019ve got a little bump on the fee rate this quarter. Is that the biggest delta X \u2013 the pickup in volumes or what else is driving that big sequential jump? And, I guess I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how we think about momentum into the third quarter.","Mike Bell","Sure, it\u2019s Mike. First, yes, the single biggest help in that ratio of fees to assets as you correctly concluded was the mix shift change into emerging markets that was particularly helpful to us in the quarter. Now \u2013 again, I would emphasize just as we have in prior quarters that we do think that ratio of fees to assets is relatively imprecise nature but to answer your question factually, yes, that mix shift plus the $5 million sequential improvement in transaction fees was the \u2013 what I would particularly highlight there.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on the deposit side, I mean, I appreciate your comments that most of the deposits is a runoff. But I think we\u2019ve said that for four quarters in a row and the average balance sheet is growing every quarter. So have you guys \u2013 is there any insight on what\u2019s driving this dramatic \u2013 sort of quarter-over-quarter growth that we\u2019ve seen over the last four quarters. And, what\u2019s your conviction level that it does run off and stay off because it seems like we\u2019re always continuing to raise our balance sheet expectations going forward?","Mike Bell","First of all, Jim, we are yet to see a period where market interest rates have increased, so we have to test the hypothesis that what happens to these excess deposits if short-term rates rise. We do have conviction that those deposits will likely find it more economic to find a different home in that environment but until we test that hypothesis with some real data, there is not much else we can do to prove it to you. And as a result, the Trust banks continue to be Safe Havens at quarter-end for a number of our clients.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Right, fair enough. And are you assuming \u2013 did you disclose that your assumptions are for the remainder of year on your balance sheet side in terms of your NIR forecast?","Mike Bell","Yes, it assumes that the range that I provided in the prepared remarks assumes a flat level with average Q2 levels. Now, again \u2013 there is going to be variance around that, I don\u2019t know whether it will end up being plus or minus but given that we only earn approximately 20 basis points of net interest margins on those excess deposits, I don\u2019t think that will be a significant overall factor NIR for the full year.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Right, okay. Thanks a lot.","Mike Bell","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawkins with UBS.","Brennan Hawkins \u2013 UBS","Good morning.","Jay Hooley","Good morning.","Brennan Hawkins \u2013 UBS","Just a quick question on the planned preferred equity capital raise that you guys have mentioned in the past, any change to your thinking around that or any clarity on timing?","Mike Bell","Sure, no \u2013 the short answer is, no change in our thinking around the prefs. We do believe that ultimately we will issue at least another $500 million of prefs in order to optimize the ratios under the Basel III risk based capital ratios. So \u2013 and in terms of the timing, we\u2019ll continue to look at market conditions and a number of other factors, at this point I wouldn\u2019t have anything else to communicate on when the timing of that ultimate $500 million.","Brennan Hawkins \u2013 UBS","Okay. And then a quick one, I know we\u2019ve sort of beaten the hell out of this dead horse but I want to give it another shot. I hear you that the environments been rough and it doesn\u2019t exactly bode well as far as the operating leverage, but we\u2019ve been saying that for a while and continuing to wait for the revenue environment to get better can probably feel like we\u2019re waiting for gondola [ph] here. So, what \u2013 do you all have something in mind where there is some sort of line to cross that would get you more aggressive to think about another cost cutting program? How much \u2013 how can we think about how much flexibility do you have in your expense base? I mean, from the color I would think you really don\u2019t have any but sometimes you find when push comes to the show that there is greater flexibility than you had previously thought off. Is there any way that you can help us think about that?","Jay Hooley","Brennan, let me give it a shot. The \u2013 we\u2019re trying to strike the right balance between investing and in spite of all this pressure that we have, we are investing. If you look at IT as just a proxy for that it\u2019s been pretty consistent throughout that and we think that this period will at some point change and rates will go up and volatility would change. In the meantime, we\u2019re trying to scrape along and extract some operating leverage plus still spending for the long-term. And, so there is always expense leverage but we\u2019re trying not to take away from the future. So we\u2019re trying to manage expenses to create operating leverage which is our goal for this year. And \u2013 that\u2019s how I respond to that.","Brennan Hawkins \u2013 UBS","Okay, thanks.","Jay Hooley","Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC","Good morning.","Jay Hooley","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC","You guys reported that the pretax operating margin improved in the quarter, I think you said to 32%. On the new business, how long does it take for \u2013 your new business wins to reach that type of operating margin?","Jay Hooley","It depends, Gerard \u2013 I\u2019d go back to my earlier reference to \u2013 let\u2019s say two-third\u2019s, three quarters of the business is more routine, somebody brings up a new fund, we convert a small mid-size pension fund for 30 to 90 days. It doesn\u2019t take long in most cases for us to achieve profitability \u2013 target profitability, you have some preparation at a time but it doesn\u2019t take quarters to get to profitability. In the case of the larger and more complex, that might let out a little bit just because of the implementation cost and getting things settled in. So that will be my response.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC","Okay. Mike, regarding the LCR, in the proposal there is some changes that apparently are coming to the calculation of the LCR. Have you guys seen or heard of any of those changes, and would they benefit you and that your LCR ratio would actually be greater than where you think it is now if those changes actually come to past?","Mike Bell","Yes, Gerard, it\u2019s like \u2013 we\u2019re obviously monitoring that situation very carefully. I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that having a major impact on the comments that I made earlier in terms of the impact but I don\u2019t want to try to speculate anymore than that until we see what the final roles are.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC","Okay. And then lastly, Mike, you talked in your prepared remarks about obviously what the ECD did with the interest rates overnight \u2013 overnight rate going to a negative number and you\u2019re exploring different options now or considering different options, as well as monitoring the competitors. What are some of the options that you guys are considering if that actually becomes more negative or just stays this way for an extended period of time?","Jay Hooley","Gerard, this is Jay.

Hooley","Thanks, Valerie, and good morning, everyone. This morning we reported third quarter operating basis earnings per share of $1.19. These results reflect the strength of our core asset servicing and asset management business, as well as the impact of seasonal declines in market-driven revenue, including the effect of low interest rates.","Total operating basis revenue grew about 3% as compared to a year-ago quarter, and total operating basis fee revenue increased by 9% over the same period, partly offset by the continuing challenging interest rate environment and investor caution in global markets.","I'm pleased with our performance year-to-date, highlighted by a 19% increase in operating basis earnings per share as compared to the first 9 months of 2012. We continue to focus on growing our core business in asset servicing and asset management while carefully managing expenses across the company.","On an operating basis, we achieved positive operating leverage for this 9-month comparison of more than 200 basis points and have positioned State Street well for continued success. Our Business Operations and IT Transformation program remains on track to deliver an additional $220 million of pretax expense savings this year and approximately $600 million for the entire program by 2015, while delivering a technology platform that enables product innovation and growth.","Turning to new business. Our third quarter 2013 new asset servicing wins totaled $200 billion, which compares to $201 billion and $211 billion of new wins reported last year and in the third quarter of 2012, respectively.","Additionally, I'm pleased to report that just after the quarter closed, we received a significant commitment from a new client to service assets totaling $137 billion. On a year-to-date basis, new business is $624 billion as compared to $573 billion in the same period in 2012. Of the $200 billion in third quarter new asset servicing wins, 42% were from outside the U.S. Also included in our new business wins are 47 new alternative asset servicing mandates, a client segment where we are a market leader and continue to see above-average long-term growth potential.","I'd now like to share my insights on market performance and the effect on asset flows we saw during the quarter. Equity markets were up during the quarter, and we did see some flows out of fixed income into equity funds, but we also experienced significant flows into money market funds, reflective of a cautious investment environment. This environment has also led to lower trading volumes from our clients.","Leading up to the debt ceiling deadline, we experienced a surge in excess deposits and a marked slowdown in trading activities. Since the temporary debt ceiling resolution of last week, excess deposits have receded and trading activity has improved.","Turning to asset management. In the third quarter, we had net outflows of $15 billion, principally from institutional passive equity funds, as well as securities finance cash pools, partially offset by inflows into money market funds and ETFs.","With respect to ETFs, the industry experienced significant volatility during the third quarter. However, we ended the quarter with $5 billion in ETF net inflows, principally into U.S. equity products. Fixed-income investors moved into our shorter-duration products, likely anticipating tapering by the Federal Reserve. During the quarter, we saw $5 billion of inflows into money market funds, which coupled with low market rates, led to an increase in money market fee waivers.","And finally, our new business pipelines in both asset servicing and asset management continue strong and well diversified.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike, who'll review our financial performance.","Michael William Bell","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our results, I'd like to reiterate how pleased I am to be a member of the State Street team. I'm also looking forward to meeting with many of you in the upcoming months.","This morning, I'll start my review on Slide 4, where we've noted several financial highlights for the quarter and for the 9-month period ended September 30, which I'll also refer to as year-to-date. Unless noted separately, I'll reference only the non-GAAP operating basis results in my comments today.","Year-to-date results were strong despite a difficult operating environment, including low short-term interest rates. Our results were driven by strong revenue growth in our core asset servicing and asset management businesses and continued focus on controlling expenses, which has driven an expansion in our operating margins.","Fee revenue growth and expense control remain key priorities going forward. Our year-to-date operating basis earnings per share has increased 19% to $3.38 compared to the same period in 2012. Year-to-date, our pretax operating margin was 30.2%, which is approximately 160 basis points higher than the same period in 2012. Our year-to-date return on equity was 10.4%. Our year-to-date total fee revenue of $5.8 billion increased 8% compared to the same 2012 period, primarily due to equity market appreciation, net new business, the revenue contributed by the GSAS acquisition and increased volumes related to foreign exchange trading. We are pleased with our year-to-date growth.","Third quarter 2013 earnings per share of $1.19 decreased 4% sequentially and increased 20% from the third quarter of 2012. Total fee revenue for the third quarter increased 9% versus the third quarter of last year. Third quarter 2013 fee revenue was sequentially lower, primarily due to the seasonal decline in securities finance and a summer slowdown in trading services.","We continue to benefit from good execution in managing expenses, which remains a top priority. We achieved 229 basis points of positive operating leverage on a year-to-date basis compared to the same 9-months period a year ago. Success in our Business Operations and IT Transformation program has contributed to this result, and we remain on track to deliver the expected $220 million of additional pretax expense savings for the full year.","On Slide 5, you can see that our third quarter 2013 net interest revenue decreased on a sequential basis, as assets that matured or paid down were replaced with lower-yielding investments in the current low-interest rate environment. Our third quarter net interest margin declined to 1.27%. Our capital position remains strong, and return of capital through common share stock repurchases and dividends remains a top priority.","During the third quarter of 2013, we repurchased approximately 8.2 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of approximately $560 million, resulting in average fully diluted common shares outstanding of approximately 452 million for this quarter.","We have approximately $1 billion remaining under our March 2013 common stock repurchase program, authorizing the purchase of up to $2.1 billion of common stock through March 31 of 2014. We also declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.26 a share. In addition, we declared a noncumulative, quarterly perpetual preferred stock dividend of $0.33 a share, which amounted to approximately $7 million.","Now I'll discuss additional details regarding our operating basis quarterly revenue, as outlined on Slide 12. Unless otherwise noted, my comments here will focus on the comparison of the third quarter of 2013 to the third quarter of 2012. I believe this is more relevant since a sequential quarter comparison includes the effects of the seasonal pattern in securities finance and the summer slowdown for trading services.","Servicing fees increased 10%, primarily due to stronger global equity markets, the GSAS acquisition and net new business. Management fees increased 10%, primarily due to stronger global equity markets and net new business. Third quarter management fees were negatively impacted by $12 million in money market fee waivers, and this compares to $5 million in the third quarter of 2012, primarily due to the very low interest rate environment.","Total trading services revenue increased 10%, primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange volumes and volatility. Securities finance revenue decreased approximately 19%, primarily due to lower spreads. Securities on loan averaged $316 billion for the third quarter of 2013, a decline from $321 billion in the third quarter of last year. Processing fees and other revenue increased approximately 23%, primarily due to an increase in fee revenue associated with our investment in bank-owned life insurance. Net interest revenue and net interest margin continued to be pressured from a persistently low interest rate environment.","On a sequential quarter basis, NIR was lower due to both lower yields on the portfolio and the lower level of average earning assets. This was partially offset by lower premium amortization on the U.S. mortgage portfolio and by lower rates on our liabilities.","Now as we've discussed previously, we do not expect the recent rise in the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield to have a noticeable impact on NIR this year because we're primarily investing in shorter-duration maturities, and short-term rates remain very low. We would need to see a larger increase at the shorter end of the curve to achieve a significant NIR benefit.","Our third quarter 2013 operating basis net interest margin or NIM was 127 basis points, down from 131 basis points in the second quarter of 2013 and down from 144 basis points in the third quarter of 2012. We continue to expect operating basis NIM for full year 2013 to be slightly below 130 basis points. This assumes that interest rates globally and client deposits remain at or around current levels for the remainder of the year, which would drive the growth in our earnings assets to approximately 5% on the full year 2013 average versus the full year 2012 average. That means that operating basis net interest revenue is expected to be approximately $170 million to $180 million lower in 2013 relative to 2012, taking into account the assumptions that I just noted.","Now let's turn to expenses on Slide 13. Our expenses were well controlled in the third quarter. Our compensation and employee benefits expenses decreased approximately 1.5% from both the second quarter of 2013 and the third quarter of 2012. This quarter's results benefited by approximately $12 billion from some adjustments to employee benefits, which we do not expect to repeat next quarter. Additionally, we had an increase in expenses related to support for new business installations.","Our Business Operations and IT Transformation program continues to be on track. For full year 2013, we expect to achieve approximately $220 million in additional pretax expense savings, resulting in approximately $418 million of pretax expense savings since the inception of the program. Our nonrecurring expenses related to our Business Operations and IT Transformation program were approximately $25 million for the third quarter of 2013.","Now other expenses decreased sequentially to $251 million, primarily due to a third quarter 2013 gain of $19 million from the sale of a legacy Lehman Brothers-related asset; lower litigation costs, including the Lehman recovery; and lower professional services fees and sales promotion costs. Also impacting the third quarter 2013 other expense line was an increase of $7 million for the new Federal Reserve supervisory assessment, which represents approximately 2 years of fees.","Now as a reminder, the other expense line is comprised of many items, including professional services fees, securities processing costs, regulatory expenses and legal costs, and can vary quarter to quarter.","Now let me provide you some details on the investment portfolio. As you can see on Slide 14, our overall approach to managing the investment portfolio has not changed. We've maintained its basic size, high credit quality and composition during the quarter. The mark-to-market improved at quarter end compared to the second quarter end, mainly due to slightly tighter spreads. Our interest rate risk position was similar to the second quarter, with a sensitivity in economic value of equity or EVE in the up-200-basis-point shock scenario at minus 14.5% of total regulatory capital. The duration of the portfolio was 1.9 years, consistent with the prior quarter. Additionally, assuming a hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in interest rates across the curve, the unrealized impact on capital is approximately minus $1.3 billion after tax.","Now we're monitoring and managing our interest rate risk position using a variety of risks measures, including EVE and the potential impact of a rise in rates on the mark-to-market and on NIR. These metrics are well within our risk appetite. Maintaining a strong capital position is very important to us. Particularly in this evolving regulatory environment, we continue to identify opportunities to optimize the capital efficiency of our balance sheet. Utilizing similar credit experience that we have from investing in corporate bonds and collateralized loan obligations, we've begun to invest in senior secured bank loans, targeting BB and single B-rated issuers, all subject to our credit underwriting standards. These loans provide attractive risk-adjusted returns and additional diversification to our balance sheet and are not mark-to-market.","Our current exposure is under $1 billion, and while we expect to grow it over time, we've planned for it to remain a relatively small portion of our overall balance sheet. We will continue to look for other ways to optimize the balance sheet that are well aligned with our core competencies and within our risk appetite.","Now let's turn to the next slide to review our capital position. As you can see from Slide 15, we remained focused on maintaining our strong capital position. This capital strength allows us to deliver on a key priority of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.","Importantly, the regulatory capital rules in the U.S. continue to evolve. As we discussed last quarter, the Federal Reserve released the Basel III final rules in July. Under the final rule, the lower of State Street's Tier 1 common ratio calculated under the Basel III advanced approach and under the Basel III standardized approach, will be State Street's effective Tier 1 common ratio in the assessment of its capital adequacy for regulatory purposes.","As of September 30, 2013, our estimated pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 10.2% under the standardized approach and 11.3% under the advanced approach. In addition, both the Basel committee and the U.S. regulators published proposals for the new Basel III supplementary leverage ratio. The U.S. proposal includes a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 5% at the holding company and 6% at the bank level. We estimate that our pro forma supplementary leverage ratios are approximately 5.4% at the holding company and approximately 5% at the bank as of September 30, 2013.","Now these proposals are still subject to change. If enacted as proposed, these ratios would take effect January 1, 2018. Assuming the rules go into effect as proposed, we believe that we have a number of levers which would enable us to comply with these requirements in advance of the 2018 effective date.","Both changes in the rules and the market could impact our anticipated supplementary leverage ratio, for example, if we're permitted to exclude central bank deposits from the calculation, or if our deposit levels were to return to historical norms. Based upon our current balance sheet, we estimate our pro forma September 30 supplementary leverage ratio would increase by a little more than 0.5%. In the meantime, we recently received clarification for the Federal Reserve regarding the incorporation of Basel III into the upcoming 2014 CCAR process. Our capital planning process already incorporates Basel III compliance standards, so this guidance is consistent with our expectations.","Importantly, in addition to the final rule on Basel III and the proposed supplementary leverage ratio, a number of regulatory initiatives that may impact our capital position and structure and the funding of our balance sheet are still open.","For example, we expect the proposed rules may be released in the coming months regarding minimum long-term debt requirements for the holding company and the capital buffer for global, systemically-important banks. Of course, we continue to carefully monitor these and the other potential regulations in development and their aggregate impact upon our business.","We remain focused on executing our capital plan that we submitted in conjunction with the 2013 CCAR, which includes our authorization to purchase up to $2.1 billion of our common stock through March 31 of 2014, of which approximately $1 billion remains available.","Now to recap our results. Our strong year-to-date fee revenue growth of 8% and our positive operating leverage are indicative of good progress on our top priorities. We expect our net interest revenue to continue to be under pressure until short-term interest rates begin to rise. We remain focused on executing our capital plan through March 31 of 2014.","Now before I conclude, I would like to briefly address the question, which may be of interest to many investors and analysts, regarding our expected capital return in 2014 in light of the evolving regulatory environment.","At this point, it would be premature to try to estimate our return of capital beyond our current plan through March 31, 2014. While we remain focused on optimizing our capital position and returning capital to our shareholders, we do not know how capital regulations will evolve nor do we yet know all of the parameters for the next CCAR process.","However, we continue to believe that our share repurchase program, combined with dividends, is the best way to return value to shareholders. And this remains a top priority for us.","And now I'll turn the call back to Jay.","Joseph L. Hooley","Thanks, Mike. Let me close our call by briefly reiterating our continued focus on creating value for our clients and shareholders by growing revenue and diligently controlling expenses. Returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends remains a top priority.","Now Mike and I are available to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","One clarification question. You had mentioned that you are -- I think last quarter, you were kind of conservative in terms of the reinvestment. The duration stayed at 1.9 years, and you had maturities run off and replaced with lower-margin assets. I think that's all consistent with what you've been saying, but I think the net interest income came a little lighter. So I guess, I'm curious. I heard you loud and clear on some of the things you're doing on the asset side. But with no change to the rate environment, should we expect a little more of the same, meaning conservative reinvestment and a little more rundown?","Michael William Bell","Sure. Glenn, it's Mike. Look, a couple comments. First, I would remind you that the second half of 2013, our outlook is still in line with the estimates that Ed had provided at Q2. Now in terms of the moving parts, a couple of comments. First, around Q3, the NIR was impacted by a couple of different things relative to the NIR in Q2. First of all, the earning assets for the quarter were down $5 billion relative to the same average in Q2, so that impacted the NIR. In addition, as you correctly noted, the average yields did decline for the average yield for the full quarter because of the turnover in the book. And again, we had anticipated that, given the low-interest rate environment, as a general rule, replacing the higher-yielding stuff that's running off with lower-yielding new purchases. And then just for completeness, I'd also remind you that Q2 had a onetime benefit of $7 million in NIR from a paydown of one particular loan. So relative to the Q2 comparison, there were a few different moving parts there. On your question on the outlook, it does depend upon a number of factors. But our current estimate at this point would be that we would see a small uptick in Q4, and that would be driven by a couple of things: First, we do anticipate a small uptick in average earning assets in Q4; and we expect an additional benefit in Q4 relative to the slowdown in prepayments on the U.S. mortgage portfolio. So those are the couple of things for 2014 that -- I'm sorry, for fourth quarter of 2013 that I would expect helping us.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Appreciate that. And I guess the second question is on the expense side, I think there's a lot of good trends. Obviously, you pointed to the operating leverage and controlling what you can control. It's just interesting how comp -- and I hear you on the onetime benefit, but comp, directionally, very well contained. And the info systems and communications lines, still up 11% year-on-year, even included in the program. So I guess it's A-B question of a, are the comp trends, as a general comment, can we connect -- we expect that to continue? And b, is this type of growth rate on the info systems line what we could expect as you continue to invest in the platform?","Michael William Bell","Well, Glenn, first of all, I appreciate your comments on expenses. As we've talked about, controlling operating expenses is a significant priority for us, as is generating a positive overall operating leverage. So that has not changed. On your specific question of info systems and communications, those have been relatively consistent here this quarter versus last quarter. And I would anticipate a relatively consistent, maybe up a little bit in Q4. Again, that's all part of the long-term IT and ops. So where we've gotten additional savings on the operations side, sometimes that has entailed incremental IT expenses. But I -- again, I wouldn't read anything into the year-over-year info systems because it is all part of the combined IT and ops program.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mike, just a follow-up on the expenses. You're continuing to drive a lot of positive operating leverage through the bank. Putting aside market factors, are there any specific reasons you'll give some of that 230 basis points back to finish the year? And just looking a bit further out than that, can you and Jay just broadly talk about your confidence to drive more operating leverage, just given the fact that you've done a lot already, markets are up a lot and the rate environment's not improving?","Michael William Bell","Sure, Howard, good morning. First, on the remainder of the year operating expenses, there are several moving parts here. First, on the comp and benefits, I don't expect, for example, that $12 million favorable expense adjustment that we had to employee benefits to repeat in Q4. So I just would suggest you be cognizant of that plus $12 million pressure. I wouldn't try at this point to put a number on Q4 for comp and employee benefits because there still are a lot of decisions that we need to make, including, for example, incentive comp for the full year. That true-up, whatever it is, will show up in Q4. And at this point, it's too early to try to put a number on it. The other comment I would make is around the other expenses. Again, the other expenses do bounce around a fair amount quarter-to-quarter. It's got things in there like litigation expenses. Well, those are basically impossible to predict with any confidence. So again, difficult to try to estimate the other expenses for Q4. Ed had commented last quarter that he would expect a normal run rate for the second half of the year to be in the $270 million to $280 million range for other expenses. That's still reasonable, but it doesn't count on anything in terms of unusual items flowing through there. So other than those 2 sort of macro points, I wouldn't expect the other line items for Q4 to look a lot different than Q3. And in terms of how that translates to positive operating leverage, obviously, that will depend in large part on the market-driven revenues. And there's several points, both plus and minus, of uncertainty out there, so that would be difficult to anticipate. Let me ask Jay if he wants to add in terms of the longer term.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, Howard. The only thing I would add is I think, consciously, we've been doing a good job of creating operating leverage in this, I would say, less-than-normal market-driven operating environment. And that's largely IT and ops and trying to become more efficient in all parts of the business. I would expect over time, as Mike points out, in a more normalized market-driven revenue environment that we should continue to have good operating leverage. The higher the revenue growth, the higher the operating leverage, is a general theme. But that's the general strategy.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And Jay, my second question. You've spoken a good bit about the alternatives servicing opportunity. I was just hoping you could just take a step back, help us place that 47 new mandates in context and talk a bit more about what you're seeing out there today, as the fundraising environment for these folks seems like it's improving, how the competitive landscape and profitability of that client segment is progressing?","Joseph L. Hooley","Sure. Happy to do that, Howard. Just to remind everybody, we got into the alternatives business early and have not only gone global with it, but have diversified across not only hedge but private equity and real estate. So we're pretty confident across the landscape of the alternatives assets. As a general theme, when we talk to our institutional asset owners, pension funds and the like, there continues to be greater allocation into alternatives. You can look at some of the alternative returns and question that judgment, but that is the trend. And so we see more assets flowing to alternatives, point one. Point two, you see more demands on the alternative asset classes for a higher level of compliance and risk reporting, both regulatory and nonregulatory. So the level of outsourcing continues to move in our favor. We have referenced before that we think 70% of the hedge marketplace is outsourced to third-party providers, but only 30% in the case of real estate and private equity. And so we're seeing kind of across-the-board gains across the 3 asset classes, across the 3 geographies. And we don't see that letting up. The last point I would make is that -- I make the point that we get into this early because if you look at the league[ph] table of who we're competing with, there are some unusual names. It's not the typical trust bank names. So we think we're pretty well-positioned competitively, and continue to invest in the platform to differentiate our service offering.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess, my first question, maybe, Jay, this is for you. But I would like to maybe get -- if we could maybe get a little bit better sense within the asset servicing. I mean, you called out the alternative business, but maybe a little bit better sense of what other segments you may be seeing some relative strength or weakness in. And I mean, if I just look at your disclosure around AUA and AUC, and knowing that, that's not -- it's far from a perfect metric. But you do see things like insurance and other growing pretty slowly, whereas collective trust products growing pretty rapidly. So could you maybe give us a little bit more insight and color in terms of the moving pieces underneath there and where the successes are or aren't?","Joseph L. Hooley","Sure. I would say, Rob, the -- you got to look at it geographically and by product segment. Geographically, even though 42% of the new commitments this quarter came from outside the U.S., tilted towards Asia, by the way, North America continues to be a big driver in spite of maybe expectations a few years ago. Within the different subcategories, we have a preferred position from a market share standpoint. And the asset manager segment, we like it. We think it offers the most diversity as far as growth and product expansion. And we continue to do well there. We've had several competitive wins. We like the segment. The segment continues to grow. Pensions, a little bit flatter. Alternatives, up into the right. I see that continuing. So that's kind of the way I see it. I mean, the sovereign wealth fund marketplace -- we -- I was in Asia last week, we're very well-positioned with the sovereign wealth funds. Whether it's oil-driven or other commodity-driven growth, those funds are growing. They're getting more sophisticated. They're investing more in alternatives. Their needs in the middle and back office are increasing. So I'd add that as an additional segment.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Great. Maybe as my follow-up, I'm just curious, a couple of years ago, I mean, yourselves and your peers and everyone, it's clearly had a similar kind of pressures on top line. And it seemed like everyone had been focused on pricing, and maybe a little more rationality was creeping into the market. I'm just kind of curious what you're seeing now. I mean, maybe you've got some more competitors in Europe who are feeling their oats a little bit more, at least because they want more fee business, or just given that everyone is kind of still under the gun as it relates to revenue pressure. Are you seeing any kind of more, I guess, I'll call it irrationality creep into the market at all? Or is it still being reasonably sane?","Joseph L. Hooley","I would say, Rob, the -- a couple of things. That matters a lot by segment. So in an alternative segment, better than a U.S. pension segment, as a for instance, and who the competitors are. But directionally, I would say same, if not a little better. I think what you hear from me and other trust banks, at least the domestic, the U.S. trust banks, as people try to get a little bit more rational around fees and try to work the fee arrangements with their customers to a better place, given the market-driven revenue pressure. There's some movement I think we're all seeing on that. And I think that's brought in some maybe more responsible pricing. In Europe, which would be the other place where custodians live, there's an occasional crazy bid. But I would say, directionally, nothing really feels very different.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just picking up on the last question. When you look at the growth in your average assets under custody year-over-year, this year versus last year, you're up about 12%. When you do the same on just the total servicing fees, you're up about 10%. So it feels like there's still a bit of a lag between fees and asset growth. Is there -- I guess, a, why do you guys think that is? And b, should we expect that gap to close in some sort of a different market environment? Or should we think of the fees growing, I guess, at a slower pace than the assets?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I mean, assets, that's a tough relationship and there's a lot of things that go into the fee side of that, but if I just pick on the third quarter, just by way of example, I think that the third quarter equity markets performed pretty well, our service fees were up a little bit. What sits in the middle of that is a mix question. So there was, on balance, client de-risking, which brings less attractive -- well, makes it less attractive from a service fee standpoint. And the other thing was that transaction volumes were down, so that's another factor that drives the service-fee-to-overall-asset-growth relationship. So I would say, I'd just point to that as an example of how these things can shift quarter-to-quarter, year-to-date. I would say overall, in a -- whatever a normalized market looks like these days, but markets where there's investor confidence, where there's investment across the full spectrum of asset classes, including emerging markets, global, we'd expect to see a pretty good relationship, a pretty consistent relationship between assets and service fees.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then on your -- just going back to the balance sheet for a second, your point you make on de-risking during the summer. I guess I'm surprised to see the deposits come down as much as they did sequentially, so maybe a little bit of color on that and how we should think about the overall kind of balance sheet size heading into 2014.","Michael William Bell","Okay. Alex, it's Mike. The size of the balance sheet, of course, as well as the level of customer deposits, those vary based on a number of different factors. We've typically had seasonality in the past, where Q3 has tended to be a little bit lower than Q2 and Q4. We do anticipate the average earning assets for Q4 to be somewhat higher than Q3, which, as I mentioned earlier, is one of the reasons we anticipate a small uptick in NIR for Q4. But again, this is -- it is an unpredictable period of time. Obviously, the -- some of the noise in Washington around the debt-ceiling crisis led to a temporary increase in our customer deposits. Most of that has abated, but some has not. So it -- again, it's really at this point, difficult to predict with certainty where the average earning assets will end up for the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","First, a general question. As a new CFO, how are you looking to manage things differently than in the past? What are your few areas of greatest focus?","Michael William Bell","Sure, Mike. Well, I think it's a little bit early for me to try to put a stake in the ground on that particular question. I mean, I really have spent my first 100 days in the job just working to learn the business, learn about our issues as a company, learn the internal structure. So at this point, I wouldn't try to put a stake in the ground saying this is how my regime, hopefully, multi-year regime, will differ from the past. But we could certainly have ongoing dialogue in 2014 on that. But I think a little early at this point.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. And 3 very small follow-ups. Why did you guys report so late this quarter? You aren't usually last, the week after everybody else.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, it's a quick one, Mike. The -- we had our board meeting off-site in Hong Kong last week. We usually -- and we have a strategy session. We decided to do it in Hong Kong. Calendars could only be coordinated for the last week, so really that's the reason we put it off a week, simply.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And then a detailed question. I mean, like, if you look at the bottom of Slide 13, the bottom right-hand corner, the bullet, where it talks about unusual items that helped the third quarter, the gain of $19 million from the sale of a legacy Lehman Brothers-related asset and then the Lehman Brothers-related recovery of $11 million, that's a pretty big onetime benefit for the quarter. So if you take that out, then it would have been an earnings miss for the third quarter. I know this is in the eyes of the beholder, but are there any unusual items that would have offset some of those onetime benefits a little bit? And, I guess, I ask you, Mike, welcome to the job as CFO, here's an earnings miss, or maybe that's the wrong conclusion.","Michael William Bell","Well, Mike, first of all, as you said, the underlying run rate, as you try to scrub onetime items, is really in the eye of the beholder, so it is really a term of art, not science. I mean, I'd make the same comment like what you just said on some of the global market-driven revenue. I mean, because FX volumes were down and as part of the seasonal slowdown, I would also think of that as not necessarily the long-term run rate as well. But I would just -- since you cited the Slide 13, I would also reference the $7 million assessment that we got from the Fed for the supervisory fee, and that wasn't there at Q2. So there were several different moving parts. I wouldn't try to put my number -- my finger on an underlying number at this stage, but just to say that we think the underlying fundamental trends for 2013 continue to be good. We're pleased with the progress we're making on our highest priorities. And to me, those are the most important headlines for the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Guys, I just want to take another stab on the operating margin. I think you were targeting 400 basis points of expansion with the efficiency initiative. I think that was off a 2010 base of 28% or 29%, and that assumes all else equal. I was wondering if you might discuss what hasn't been equal, so to speak, in terms of expenses and how that affects your outlook on the level of the margin. It seems like you're saying now that we need a change in the operating environment -- revenue environment, really, to exceed a 30.5% margin, but I thought perhaps the projection of 400 basis points really didn't depend on that.","Michael William Bell","Okay. Luke, it's Mike. First, just to recap what Ed said again last quarter and what he has said pretty consistently in the past. The starting point for 2010 is 27.5%. There were some nonrecurring items that he had spiked out in there. So you really want to think about it as 27.5% plus 400 basis points to get to an overall pretax margin of 31.5%. Now on a year-to-date basis, we're at 30.2%. At this point, we expect to achieve in 2014 and beyond another $180 million of ops and IT transformation savings. Bottom line is we still think we can get from the 30.2% to the 31.5%. Now again, an important caveat, as Ed said many, many times, is that, that does assume all things equal. And as you indicate, all things are never exactly equal. And how our mix of business changes, things like the regulatory environment, where will our interest rates be, I mean, there are a number of other moving parts that can impact our longer-term margins. But at this point, we feel good about the savings we've gotten from our IT and ops transformation and feel good about our trajectory on the year-to-date profit margins.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. That was helpful context and a helpful reminder. And just a longer-term question on the balance sheet size. Could you remind us of what your estimate of excess deposits is currently, and then what impact, if any, do expect on your deposit balances if the Fed were to unwind its balance sheet and take excess reserves out of the system? In other words, like, how strong is the linkage between the amount of reserves in the banking system and the liquidity that's been aggregating, specifically on your balance sheet?","Michael William Bell","Okay. So the -- in terms of the excess deposits, Luke, at Q3, on average, we estimate that our excess deposits were $19 billion for the quarter. As the Fed -- if the Fed unwinds quantitative easing, assuming that interest rates would rise, I would expect that we would see those $19 billion of excess deposits move off of our balance sheet. Now again, the pace of that, the timing of that, what other alternatives are out there for clients to look at, their level of risk appetite in that scenario, those are all moving parts. Those are all factors that will impact the timing and the amount. But basically, we think of it as $19 billion of average excess deposits in Q3. The only other thing I would add is that they've been running higher thus far in October. But again, we would think that that's probably a temporary phenomenon because of the debt-ceiling crisis. But that's also something that we're watching.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions. One is on NIM, and you highlighted that there's an outlook for a little bit of an improvement as you go into 4Q overall. Could you speak to the discount accretion, because it looks like there was a fall-off maybe about half Q-on-Q, and I'm wondering if -- how you're thinking about that rate of change going forward?","Michael William Bell","Are you specifically referring, Betsy, to the discount accretion from the conduit program?","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Correct.","Michael William Bell","Yes, we did have a rather large paydown in Q2. I don't specifically have that number off the top of my head. Again, I think if you adjust for that, we wouldn't anticipate a major change. But again, I must admit I have not squirreled the legacy conduit program in detail to be able to answer your question with a lot of specificity.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. But would you expect that, that would just grind down from here, not increase, right?","Michael William Bell","Yes, that's correct.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, okay. And then maybe we could just touch base a little bit on the securities finance. I know industry-wide, there's been -- sec lending has been down Q-on-Q and year-on-year, but maybe you could just highlight if there's anything specifically that was going on in your program to drive the year-on-year decline that we saw.","Joseph L. Hooley","No, Betsy, I don't think so. Our on-loan balances are pretty consistent. They were off a little bit year-over-year, but a little bit north of $300 billion. Customers that are in the program, are staying in the program. Demand was off in the third quarter and spreads were compressed, and I think it's that simple. We would expect in a little bit -- in a better environment, demand would improve and hopefully, spreads. I mean, spreads are compressed quite a bit from where they were a year ago, but nothing other than that.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So that's more volume driven than, obviously, value driven in terms of the market, right? Because the market was up nicely.","Joseph L. Hooley","Correct.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then in the equity market environment that we got, I don't know, I would've expected that AUC might have been up a little bit more. And I know you spoke through earlier on the call where you're strong, and one of the places you are strong is in the mutual fund industry. So maybe you could square that a little bit for us.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I would say we tracked almost to the -- as far as our flows intra-quarter to the ICI. But we're a little bit different in that we had more of a -- more flows into money market funds, for instance. Equities, equity -- the -- out of bonds into equity funds, but proportionately more into money funds, which is a little bit off of where the ICI data would lead you. And so the mix was, on balance, slightly negative from a standpoint of risk-taking and related fees.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, so you say this is an unusual quarter based on how market participants were behaving relative to the volatility in the rates market and the [indiscernible].","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I mean, I would say equally important was the volume of trading. That is also a revenue component of the service fees. So I would weight that equally with the mix shift. And I would think the third quarter was an unusual environment, particularly the tail end of the third quarter. And we saw not only capital markets volumes down, but I think consistent with assets ramping up on our balance sheet, trading was down end of the third quarter. I would hope that's unusual.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Two questions. One, Jay, you mentioned you've had some pressure on the fee rate from de-risking, particularly in emerging markets. But over the last 6 weeks, we've seen a pretty big jump in emerging markets. Do you think that could begin to start helping you in the fourth quarter on the fee rate side?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, if it sustains itself, Jim, it certainly would. We've -- I would say, last 6 weeks, you're right, and even in the last couple of days, post debt-ceiling debacle, the -- it looks like risking has improved. But that's -- 2 days doesn't make a trend. But if that were to sustain itself through the quarter, that would be a good, positive factor for us.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Right, okay. And then just on the capital ratios, when we look at the difference between standardized and advanced, should we -- will that difference persist or should we expect to see that gap close, for instance, as you run off the held-to-maturity conduit assets? Is that the major difference, or no?","Michael William Bell","No. Jim, it's Mike. That is -- that's not really the major difference. The major difference is that the standardized approach has standard risk factors and haircuts, which are more punitive really in 2 areas. First, they're particularly punitive for the high-quality assets on our balance sheet, which is obviously the bulk of the portfolio. And then there are certain off-balance-sheet items, for example, securities finance, that the standardized approach is more punitive as well. So those are really the 2 primary differences. I would not anticipate that the runoff of the legacy conduit program to be a material driver of that delta.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","All right. It won't close the gap, but you'll get some RWA benefit for both?","Michael William Bell","We will get some RWA benefit for both.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just staying on the capital question. Can you remind us what is the constraining factor for you guys? Is it the Tier 1 common Basel III standardized or advanced in the CCAR process? Or is it now the SLR? How do you think about it? Or is it something else?","Michael William Bell","Sure. Good morning. The -- well, first, as it relates to this upcoming CCAR, Andrew, I think it's premature to give you a definitive answer because, in fact, we haven't seen the instructions yet. So we'll obviously know a lot more when we see the final instructions and the final parameters. But the way I'm thinking about it really is at 2 different levels. The first is the quantitative level, and yes, we do expect that the Basel III standardized Tier 1 common ratio would be an important ratio here for us, beginning 1\/1\/2015. We had anticipated that being the case, and again, believe quantitatively that will be important here for 2000 -- beginning 1\/1\/2015. I think, though, equally importantly would be the qualitative considerations. I mean, really what CCAR is about qualitatively is demonstrating that we do have a robust, long-term capital plan to be in compliance with the new rules. Now -- and so I think both will be important here in terms of the capital distribution plan. You asked about the supplementary leverage ratio. I think at this point, that would be premature in all likelihood. Although again, subject to the caveat that we haven't seen the final instructions yet for CCAR. I'd just ask you to remember that the SLR at this point is proposed, it's not final. And in prior years, we've not been held to proposed rules that are not yet finalized. So we'll learn more over the next coming months and give you an update. But what we're really focused on are the Basel III ratios, and again, that qualitatively having a long-term robust plan.","Joseph L. Hooley","And Andrew, just to add to that for a minute. The -- we, I think, just yesterday, put in our commentary on the supplemental leverage ratio, as did other big banks. The issue that's front and center for us is this whole excess deposit issue. We hold excess deposits for customers, we lay them off on central banks. For us to have to hold 6% capital against that, it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, given that, I think, the intent of the supplemental leverage ratio is that it's a backstop or a secondary ratio. So we're hoping that reason will prevail as they finalize that rule.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then maybe related, I mean, is it also premature to assume that you guys should keep to kind of what you've been doing the last couple of years of 100% combined payout going into '14, given these factors and other kind of -- the tough top line, but yet still[ph] expense leverage, et cetera?","Michael William Bell","The short answer, Andrew, is yes. It is premature to comment on that.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if I might, 1 second topic on just expenses. Can you remind us in terms of where you stand on the IT expense initiative? I know you're about 70% through that, I guess. Did you say that you were going to basically be at kind of the full run rate by the end of 2014? Did I hear that right? And then also, you had that additional expense initiative of $90 million savings that you have previously talked about, kind of being at 70% heading into this quarter or -- sorry, at the end of last quarter. Where do we stand on that as well?","Michael William Bell","Okay. Sure, Andrew. We would anticipate achieving our aggregate IT and ops savings of $600 million in the first half of 2015. So what that means is we've got approximately $180 million left. We've got $130 million that we expect to impact 2014, and then another $50 million that we would expect to impact 2015. And again, we're on track for the 2013 target. So I would not expect, for example, incrementally more expense saves in Q4 versus Q3 on the 2013 tranche. That -- those expenses at this point have been basically captured. On your question on the year-end 2012 program, at this point, we have captured those savings in the run rate. And so again, at this point, those have been executed on.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So with that, is it fair to assume that you can achieve positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis again, even in this tough top environment, if it lasts for longer into 2014? Is that a fair assumption?","Michael William Bell","Yes, again, it's a little early to comment on 2014 definitively. Again, I think the main question is really the market-driven revenues, what is that environment going to look like. If we saw a more return to normal, for example, with interest rates, as well as some of the market-driven revenues, we would anticipate a positive operating leverage. But again, certainly, at this point, that's a goal, but I wouldn't say that we could give you guidance at this point on 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, just to clarify on the improvement you expect for 4Q in NIR. Is there any reason that wouldn't continue into 1Q of next year and beyond? Is there anything particularly seasonal about the increase in earning assets you're expecting and the improvement?","Michael William Bell","Yes, Cynthia, it's Mike. The -- again, it's really early to try to give you thoughts on 2014. It will just depend upon a lot of different factors. Notably, I would point out, would be the view on market interest rates. I mean, if market interest rates continue to be static, then we would anticipate additional downward pressure on NIR and NIM next year. But again, early to try to put any numbers around it. On the deposit question, we do anticipate continuing growth in the book of business. But again, at this point, I wouldn't try to give you a definitive outlook for 2014.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up on the AUC. And I realize a few people have asked about this, so at the risk of beating a dead horse, it seemed like your AUC was up about 1% sequentially despite pretty strong markets and an asset mix which is pretty well weighted toward equities. So aside from things like fee rate, questions of fee rate and that sort of thing, just based on the mix of assets you began with, why wouldn't it have been up more just based on the market appreciation in the equity assets? And should we conclude that you had some net outflows that offset the $200 million or so -- or the $200 million of wins you mentioned? Or was there something lumpy beyond that?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, let me try that. We didn't have any big outflows or losses that contributed to that. It's really more a matter of our mix, which was more negative from a standpoint of client risking, meaning more into money market funds versus equities, which is a slight difference from where the market was, combined with, in our service fee business, transaction fees are an important component of the fee rate, and transactions were off quite a bit in the third quarter. So really, those are the factors.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, I was asking more about the ending asset level than the fees?","Joseph L. Hooley","Ending asset levels...","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Up only 1%?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, let me take a look at that, Cynthia. From $18.8 trillion to $19.2 trillion, is that the reference.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. You know what, maybe we can just pursue this off-line?","Joseph L. Hooley","Okay, great. Fine.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Jay, I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on the pipeline, the pace of potential wins across both servicing and asset management. I heard your comment about the big win coming in just after the end of the quarter. I'm just wondering if that's any indication that you're starting to see some potential chunk of your pieces of business up for bid and potentially landable.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I would say, Ken, pretty steady. I mean, that new business, the one that we committed after the quarter, was chunky. But I would say pretty steady. I am particularly pleased with our competitive win rate when we're in the not only alternative but asset management business. Our win rate is quite high. We've had -- and the pipeline is pretty solid and pretty diversified. So I wouldn't directionally say better or worse, but pretty steady.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","What about just underneath that granularity of, like, is the type of business you're bringing on higher or lower incremental margin relative to history or recent periods? Are you seeing better business? If the volume is static, what's the context of the type of new business you're bringing on?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I would say in a world of $200 billion a quarter, which is a lot of deals underlying that, it's a real mix. I would give you a few examples. We seem to have an addition to alternatives. The ETF servicing business is a real strong category for us. In the Goldman acquisition, the GSAS acquisition, we said we thought we could cross-sell. We have done a terrific job at not only cross-selling, but taking relationships that were thinly serviced and moving up into the back, middle office, 2 big deals there, which are very attractive from the standpoint of return. So it's -- without going through a list, Ken, it's hard to directionally say better or worse, other than very diversified and a good, solid pipeline.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And, Mike, you announced the $200 billion of new, but could you give us the left to convert on both the asset servicing and asset management side?","Joseph L. Hooley","I'll give you that, Ken. The -- on the asset servicing side, between everything we have committed up till now plus the $200 billion, it's about 185 that's in the pipeline waiting to convert. Is that what you're looking for?","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes, and that's as of the third, right? That's x the new win?","Joseph L. Hooley","That -- that's x the new win, correct. So the 127 plus 184 would be the to-be installed number.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then how about on the management side?","Joseph L. Hooley","I don't know that I could give you that number.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. Last really quick one, just one final one on the expenses. So you're at the run rate for this year's plan. This year, the bulk of the saves came in earlier in the year. Is that the same context we should expect from the incremental benefits for '14? Does it -- most of it come in early part of the year like it did this year?","Michael William Bell","Ken, I would say generally the answer is yes. I wouldn't say -- necessarily use the exact same percentages that we delivered on this year. We're still working through the specifics of the 2014 budget. But generally, it is right that we tend to focus on getting those saves in the first half of the year, but not necessarily all of them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you guys go over the loan portfolio, how you grew it, Mike, in the quarter? Can you tell us -- you said it was going to grow to a larger size. I may have missed the percentage of loans, but how big do you think that could get to the -- on the BB\/B credits that you mentioned earlier?","Michael William Bell","Yes, good morning, Gerard. At this point, we haven't specifically sized our capacity there, Gerard. It will be something that we'll continue to look at throughout 2014. I'd say to put an upper ceiling on it, I would not anticipate it, for example, reaching 3% of our total balance sheet. But other than giving you that as an outer ceiling, I wouldn't try to put a size on it for 2014 yet. It's still something that we're looking at.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And did that portfolio contribute to the drop in the average rates that you reported on your average balance sheet, which came in at 1.66% for loans and leases down from 2.29%?","Michael William Bell","No, that -- again, it was a relatively small number in terms of volume, Gerard, and that particular loan book is mainly -- actually, has mainly nothing to do with leveraged loans. Leveraged loans are only $0.5 billion of that number. The particular number that you're focused on is mainly the loans that we do, for example, to -- for closed-end mutual funds. And so again, apples and oranges there.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sure. What contributed then to the decline in the yield in the portfolio? Or was the yield unusually high in the second quarter?","Michael William Bell","Again, it's basically just a change in mix. We've been growing that particular loan book. We like the characteristics of that book. We think they're attractive risk-adjusted spreads. But the nominal yield in any particular quarter is going to bounce around based on the mix of those funds.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, in your interest-bearing deposit section of the liabilities, we noticed all year a steady decline in the U.S. accounts. Can you share with us what's driven that number down to about $5.8 billion from about $16 billion at the beginning of the year?","Michael William Bell","Oh, right. The -- Gerard, mainly that is the maturing of the wholesale CDs that we had, really, back in 2012. That's been -- those have been generally maturing off of the balance sheet.","Operator","Your final question is a follow-up from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","One question for you, Jay, is just when you benchmark your pretax margin, you're squarely in the 30s whereas your peers are in the mid- to upper-20s. And I'm trying to -- do you claim victory there? Are there business mix differences and is there a lot more to go once you finish this process with the IT and op transformation? But before you answer that, maybe for you, Mike, just to get clarification, how much in the IT and ops savings did you have in the third quarter for the total program? And how does that compare to the second quarter?","Michael William Bell","Let's see, Mike, the -- in terms of the IT and ops program, we are now at the full year run rate saves here at Q3. So again, we'll get another tranche in Q4. But incrementally, Q3 to Q4 is approximately 0, so we're already at the full year rate. I just don't quite remember Ed's number from Q2. So there was a small benefit Q3 to Q2. It was not particularly material in the grand scheme of things. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Mike, we're essentially offset by some of the incremental operating expenses from new business installations. So again, when you wash out those 2 together, it's approximately flat.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Yes, just -- so you have $180 million left or $230 million left for the entire program?","Michael William Bell","$180 million for 2014 and 2015.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay, $180 million total. So if you add that to the 30.2% year-to-date rate, then you're at already -- if you get that, that's 32% pretax margin, you'll be there.","Michael William Bell","Well, okay. Yes, but importantly, that's all things equal. There are any number of different things in terms of mix of business, regulatory costs, where will NIM be. I mean, again, I -- there -- your arithmetic is correct, but I wouldn't conclude then you should plug 32% into your model.","Joseph L. Hooley","And, Mike, let me just pick up the other question with regard of declaring victory. I mean, to me, the IT and ops transformation, everybody wants to focus on the expense saves, which are important. But equally important to me is transforming our IT operation to improve our operating environment, to reduce cost, to improve client service deliveries. So I think it's transformational, not only because of the efficiently but because of where it puts us relative to the introduction of new products and evolving the cloud. So it just seems like a natural for this kind of business to move in that direction.","Hey, Christie, before we end, let me just -- I don't know if Ken Usdin is still on the line, but I just wanted to reference that to his question of the SSgA, the uninstalled new business was around $25 billion, just for the record.

Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, will speak first; then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our first quarter 2018 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. [Operator Instructions]","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include adjusted basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our 1Q 2018 slide presentation.","In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements.

As you've seen in our announcement today, we started the year with strong business momentum across our asset servicing and asset management business, as we continued to deepen client relationships, win new business and advance our digital leadership.","First quarter results included strong EPS growth and improved return on equity. Importantly, we continue to see momentum across our core franchise. Strength in equity markets and new business lifted our asset under custody administration with growth of approximately 11% from first quarter 2017 to more than $33 trillion.","We announced record new servicing commitments of $1.3 trillion in the first quarter with total new business yet to be installed of $1.6 trillion. We're seeing strength across our pipeline, both geographically and by capability.","State Street Global Advisors finished first quarter 2018 with asset under management levels of $2.7 trillion, up approximately 7% from first quarter 2017, driven by strength in equity markets and ETF flows with continued traction in our low cost ETF products launched last year.","Furthermore, we continue to realize benefits from State Street Beacon, our multi-year program to digitize our business and drive new solutions and innovations for our clients as evidenced by this quarter's announced wins. Beacon investments are enabling us to go beyond traditional custody services and provide greater speed, scale and quality declines globally.","Additionally, our ability to deliver new tools and functionality is proving to be a meaningful factor, and from a differentiation in clients decision to expand their relationship with us across asset classes and funds.","But to conclude, I'm very pleased with our financial performance to-date. Revenue growth was strong driven by both fee revenue and net interest income, reflecting higher U.S. market interest rate, continued market appreciation, new client business wins and higher trading activity.","We really focused on expense management, while calibrating investment in our business with the revenue environment and prudently investing in new products and solutions. We also purchased $350 million of our common stock and declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.42 per share in first quarter 2018. And importantly, we continue to be well positioned to achieve our financial objectives in 2018, including delivering full year positive fee operating leverage.","Now over to Eric.","Eric Aboaf","Thank you, Jay and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 4, where I would like to remind you of a few items. Beginning this quarter, we are reporting primarily on a GAAP basis. We will continue to call out notable items such as restructuring cost to better provide investors insights on an underlying business trends.","As you can see in the right side of Slide 4, we did not have any notable items in 1Q, 2018. We have, though, listed the notable items for 4Q, 2017 and 1Q, 2017. As a reminder, 1Q, 2018 results reflect the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standards, resulting in an increase in both fee revenue and total expense by $65 million, which is EBIT neutral.","Now let me move to Slide 5. Most of my comments will focus on 1Q 2018 results compared to 1Q 2017, the year ago period. 1Q 2018 EPS increased to $1.62, up 41%, reflecting strength in servicing and management fees from higher equity markets and new business, continued momentum in net interest income supported by the higher interest rate environment and the lower share count.","We continue to prudently manage expenses relative to the revenue environment, as demonstrated by an increase of 3.4 percentage points in 1Q 2018 pretax margin. We thus achieved positive operating leverage of 5 full percentage points. Fee operating leverage was negative six-tenth of a point.","The elevated impact of higher FX swap cost, which we would have preferred to book in net interest income, amounted to a 1% headwind to fee operating leverage this quarter. Notably, return on equity increased approximately 3 percentage points relative to 1Q 2017.","1Q 2018 results reflected a 14% tax rate, albeit lower than our full year expectation, primarily due to a seasonal benefit of approximately $0.02 a share attributed to equity compensation.","Now let me turn to Slide 6 to briefly review AUCA and AUM performance. AUCA and AUM increased from 1Q 2017, benefiting both our asset servicing and asset management businesses. 1Q 2018 AUCA of $33.3 trillion increased 12%. Growth was primarily driven by a combination of market appreciation, client activity and new business.","Strong inflows continued in ETFs around the world in both on and offshore funds in EMEA and within our middle-office outsourcing business. Hedge fund outflows continued in 1Q 2018, albeit at more modest levels. Notably, as Jay referenced, we announced a record $1.3 trillion in new mandates for 1Q 2018.","In our asset management business, AUM increased 7% driven by market appreciation and higher-yielding ETF inflows, partially offset by outflows from lower fee institutional index mandates. Our new low-cost ETF offering continues to gain momentum and added $7 billion inflows this quarter, bringing us to $12 billion cumulatively over just 6 months.","Please turn to Slide 7, where I will review 1Q 2018 revenue compared to 1Q 2017. You will also find additional detail in the appendix with the sequential quarter comparison. Total fee revenue increased approximately 8%, reflecting strong performance across our businesses. Let me take you through some of the details.","Servicing fees increased 10%, reflecting higher global equity markets and new business, partially offset by some continued modest hedge find outflows. Adjusting for currency translation, which you can see at the table at the bottom, servicing fees were up 6%, which shows strong business momentum.","Management fees increased 24%, benefiting from higher global equity markets, as well as approximately $45 million related to the new revenue recognition standard. Trading revenue increased 11%, primarily due to strong FX client volumes and higher electronic trading activity as well as approximately $50 million in related to the new revenue recognition standard. The breadth and depth of our FX capabilities and platforms continues to differentiate our offerings.","Securities finance fees increased from 1Q 2017, driven by higher lending activity in the agency business. Processing fees and other revenue decreased from 1Q 2017, largely reflecting the absence of a one-time gain in 1Q 2017 from the sale of the business and the impact of elevated FX swap costs, which I mentioned earlier. We would expect lower FX swap cost going forward here, as more swaps qualify for hedge accounting and as we ship the currency mix of our balance sheet.","Moving to Slide 8. NII was up 23% and NIM increased 26 basis points on a fully tax equivalent basis from 1Q 2017. NII and NIM benefited from higher U.S. interest rates, disciplined liability pricing, higher client balances. U.S. dollar, interest-bearing, client deposit betas floated up during 1Q 2018, in line with our expectations.","Relative to 4Q 2017, average non-interest bearing deposits declined only slightly, while interest bearing deposits increased $5 billion on average, which demonstrated good client engagement. Relative to 4Q 2017, NIM improved 5 basis points driven by higher market rate and disciplined deposit pricing, partially offset by a smaller tax equivalent adjustment for our municipal bond portfolio and a modestly larger balance sheet.","As we said previously, we are comfortable \u2013 we are comfortable with modestly growing the balance sheet to accommodate client demand, and have even created more room to do so by adjusting our investment portfolio this quarter, which I will cover in a few minutes.","Now I will turn to Slide 9 to review 1Q 2018 expenses. Expenses were up 6% adjusted for currency translation, though this included $65 million in higher expenses related to the new accounting standards for revenue recognition, partially offset by the absence of restructuring cost this quarter.","When considering these two effects, underlying expenses increased only 4% for the year ago quarter. The components of the 4% underlying growth in expenses include, 3 percentage points of new business and volumes, 2 percentage points of merit and incentive compensation and 2 percentage points in technology spent, partially offset by a net 3 percentage points in Beacon savings.","From a GAAP line item perspective, compensation and employee benefits increased primarily due to increased costs to support new business as well as annual merit and incentive compensation, partially offset by Beacon savings.","Transaction processing increased relative to 1Q 2017 driven by higher sub-custody fees. Information systems cost increased relative to 1Q 2017 as a result of additional technologies spent. Occupancy costs were up compared to 1Q 2017, but have been relatively flat for several quarters. Finally, as compared to 4Q 2017, expenses were up primarily due to the seasonal deferred incentive compensation cost, which are described in the footnotes.","Let me now move to Slide 10 to review our progress on State Street Beacon. On the left side of the slide, you see some of the achievements which are enabling us to win with clients. We continue to digitize how we receive and process data from clients, using speed and scale as a way to differentiate service.","Key accomplishments include improving efficiencies from enhancing our global accounting platform and upgrading the functionality of our information delivery platform to better meet client needs. We're also continuing to realize enterprise-wide efficiencies as we automate internal processes through Beacon initiatives.","On the right side of the page, you can see that we achieved $58 million in net Beacon saves this quarter, through optimizing our core servicing business, transforming our IT infrastructure and by gaining efficiencies within the corporate functions and SSGA. We continue to expect $150 million in Beacon savings in 2018, including the $58 million achieved this quarter.","Now let's turn to Slide 11 to review our quarter end balance sheet and capital position. On the left of the slide, you will notice that we reduced the size of our investment portfolio from year-end 2017. We sold approximately $12 billion of non-HQLA securities during the quarter. Those portfolio sales reflect our strategy to prioritize capital efficient client lending, while prudently managing OCI sensitivity.","We chose to rotate out of thin spread credit securities and we will reinvest into interest earning assets over time. Trimming the portfolio, especially the dollar portions, will also have the benefit of reducing the size of our FX swap balances and the associated cost which I mentioned earlier.","Moving to the right of the slide, our capital ratios remain healthy and all of our ratios are flat to up, year-on-year. As compared to 4Q 2017, the only significant change was a decrease of 80 basis points in the standardized version of a common equity tier 1 ratio due to an increase in client overdraft balances, which has since been recovered by our clients and the impact has reversed. While we are mindful of our leverage ratios, recent regulatory developments make us even more confident, we can put our balance sheet to work for our clients.","To recap, moving to Slide 12, we saw strong business momentum, resulting in headline total revenue growth of 13% and servicing fee revenue growth of 10%. Our pretax margin increased by 3.4 percentage points from 1Q 2017, and we delivered EPS growth of 41%.","Before turning the call back to Jay, let me take a moment to provide you with some additional color relative to our quarterly outlook. We expect business momentum within asset servicing to continue. Although, there may be some variability within quarters as new business is installed. We expect securities finance, which includes the agency and enhanced custody businesses, to experience some 2Q seasonal uptick in relation to 1Q, albeit at muted levels relative to last year.","As I mentioned earlier, we expect swap cost to moderate as we adjust the currency mix of our balance sheet. As such, a typical quarterly range for processing fees and other revenue should be around $35 million to $45 million in 2018. We expect momentum in NII to continue in 2Q, consistent with our full year target range.","In summary, we believe that our strong first quarter business momentum positions us well to execute against both our financial and strategic priorities, including positive fee operating leverage, in keeping with our full year 2018 outlook range that we provided in January.","Now let me turn the call back to Jay.","Jay Hooley","Thanks, Eric. And then Sam, we should now \u2013 I'd ask you to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Eric, interested to hear a little bit more about the plan to shift up the investment and the earning asset portfolio. What types of loans are you looking to grow? And how should we think about that as far as a change, proportionally? I think it might be helpful to sort of base a little bit of that. Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Hey, Brennan. It's Eric. Let me describe a little bit of our intentions here. Clearly, as we enter this market with rising rates, it's a natural time for us to consider how much to keep on non-HQLA assets versus other interests earning assets. We've made a choice to continue to optimize that part of the balance sheet. And what you'll see us doing over time is shifting some of that into interest earning assets for clients, right? And I'll \u2013 some of that will be lending, as you've asked about come back that in a moment. Some that'll be support the enhanced custody business, some that'll support our other activities.","And then another portion, just we reinvested in interest earning assets that HQLA qualifying, and thereby, balance out the balance sheet. So I think you'll see us continue to design the balance sheet in a way that supports multiple objectives. In terms of lending, our lending growth, and you see mid-teen lending growth over the last year. It's been consistent over the last couple of years. We lend to 40 Act funds, we lend to the parent companies of some of our large clients, we do capital call financing for some of our private equity client.","And so, that's the kind of, I'll call it, near end lending that will be \u2013 that'll continue to be the core of what we do. And our perspective is that some of that lending is remunerative on its own. Some of that lending is actually positive, because it gives us an extra way to interact and to connect with our clients. And that's something that they value. And sometimes actually ask for as part of the servicing mandates for others that we participate in.","Brennan Hawken","Yes, thanks. That makes a lot of sense actually. And it seems like a good way to expand out the relationship. So another question on the balance sheet. And it seemed like you implied it in your prepared remarks, Eric, but please correct me if I'm wrong. It seems like the balance sheet and the average deposit balances grew here similar to the peers. But seems as though there is sustained appetite there. And so am I correct in implying that we shouldn't necessarily think about that reverting from what was a pretty strong growth rate here this quarter? And you think that, that could sustain, or at least the indication so far looks like it's pretty durable here?","Eric Aboaf","Brennan, yes, I think the way to think about our balance sheet growth is that you dial back three years, we needed to compress the size of our balance sheet and kind of focus of the most valuable part of the funding of the deposits that we had. And we did that like many other. I think last year, we felt like we had also seen another tick up in balances and some currencies and some overall balances. And we felt like we had to continue to trim and make it more compact and kind of more higher NIM generating.","I think we've gotten to a point over the last couple of quarters where we're comfortable with the size of our balance sheet and we signaled, as part of January outlook, that we're comfortable with modest growth. And so you saw a little bit of that, quarter-on-quarter. The trimming of the investment portfolio gives us an ability to do that. Deposits now, in dollars in particular, come in at healthy margins. And it's just another way to engage with all of our clients, whether it's the asset managers, whether it's the alternative providers, whether it's some of the FX kind of parties. They all value the ability to leave their cash with such a highly-rated counterparty. And our perspective is, that's part of what we can do and should do. And if you come full circle, that's a good service for them and provides good earnings and earnings growth for us.","Brennan Hawken","Great. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks. If you could talk about the new business wins. Talk about what they're engaging you on? Is it new versus existing clients, fee-rate relative to overall maybe you could go through a little bit of that?","Jay Hooley","Sure, Glenn. This is Jay. I'll start and then Eric can jump in. Obviously, an outsized quarter, this quarter for new business commitments, that the $1.3 trillion. And not surprisingly, there's a couple of big deals embedded within that. I would say, general themes, our clients consolidating with fewer providers. So if the two big deals, one represented that, a global player that operates in many different geographies and chose to consolidate with State Street, which is terrific. The other big deal represented a large client that decided for the first time to outsource fund accounting to the administration. Which I think just speaks to the ongoing challenge that the asset management industry is having and looking for ways to get more efficient, outsource more activities.","So that represent a little bit of the outlier growth in the quarter. I would say, maybe more generally, Glenn, the pipelines and the new business that we committed is pretty diverse. Little concentration in Europe, which continues to be an outperformer in the offshore marketplace. ETS, as a service provider to ETS, we think we have a very differentiated proposition. So ETS continue to be a theme. But across the geographies, well balanced.","Final point I'd make before I give Eric a shot is that in the two big deals that we \u2013 that were embedded in the quarter. They both went very deep in their diligence looking at, as you'd expect, State Street's capabilities. And Beacon featured very positively. As people get in and peel back the covers and understand the investments that we're making and how we view a future around consolidating back, middle, front office, it's really a differentiator. So in one of those in particular, I don't remember being examined the way we were examined by that perspective client. And the deeper they got, the better we looked. So I'd say that it's reinforcing, to me, the efforts of Beacon, not just to create more efficiencies, but when clients take a look at us, they've been \u2013 really understand that we are investing for the future. And we do have a vision about how this business is going to look over time. Eric, would you add anything?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, Glenn, I'd just add that, it showed some real positive momentum in the business. I'd just be careful. It's hard to model how and when that this. Some new business comes in right away. Some of the simpler activity. Some of the more complex stuff takes time. We're not going to, in any particular quarter, give guidance as to when stuff is going to get installed or not. I think we're just going to overdo it then. But there is a range, right? Sometimes you bring on an alternative mandate and you get 5 or 6 bps because of the fee structure. Sometimes it comes on as custody accounting administration, so you get what might be typical in terms of fee yield. And sometimes, you might just get custody because there may be other activities in discussion or possible down the road. And so you start with your foot in the door, so to speak. And that comes at a fraction of the typical or the average fee rate. So there is a mix there. I think it's a nice positive momentum from a business standpoint, which makes us feel a little good about the progress and successes today.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. One tiny follow-up, Eric, on the balance sheet. It seems like it got more fixed rate versus floating. As rates are rising, just not as intuitive as I would've thought. I'm sure it's much more involved than that.","Eric Aboaf","Yes, Glenn. Good observation, what the \u2013 the immediate change that you noticed, which is really just a quarter-on-quarter change on the asset side of the balance sheet. So we'll come back on the liabilities on the asset side as we sell down the Non-HQLA securities. You know the bulk of those were credit instruments. Credit instruments tend to be floating rate. So the mix changes just in kind of a percentage nature, not in a dollar amount. We've continued to maintain, though, the asset-sensitive balance sheet that we've had. And we feel good about that. That's paid out nicely over the last two years and \u2013 so our asset sensitivity still remains in the range where we'll \u2013 where we're positioned for a rising rates, in particular, in this short end of the curve.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. And Ken your line is open. Your next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hi guys, good morning. I want to start off with just talking about the operating leverage dynamic in the quarter. So I understand the FX swap dynamic. Obviously, Eric, you point tracked it about a 1 percentage point from operating leverage on the fee side. So adjusted modestly positive, but again albeit, very modest especially in the light of pretty strong equity markets and improving volumes. So maybe go through a little what's going on there? Anything that drove, in particular, sort of muted operating leverage on the fee side this quarter. I don't know, which is the sizable wins that might've suppressed some of that a little bit. So just help us understand how to think through the fee operating leverage through the rest of the year.","Eric Aboaf","Yes, Alex. Fair question. There's always variability quarter-on-quarter on both the revenue side and the expense side. You saw that on the revenue side with the FX swaps. And in that processing other line that we have, it's really the kind of all other line. Every bank has that somewhere in their books. And so you have the swaps. And then we had slightly better results from that a year ago. Slightly below average this year. And so the year-on-year actually got accentuated. You have other stuff in there. Small stuff. You have the mark-to-mark on the seed capital for a new asset management fund, which was positive a year ago. You've got the tax advantage investments and how much they run through revenue.","On the negative side, that was less negative a year ago. So you kind of have those puts and takes. And that's why in addition to the FX swap, we saw lower than typical processing in other line and that impacted the top line part of operating leverage by one point for FX swaps. And then there is another point but it's small stuff, which we don't like to get into, but just tends to play through.","On the expense side, if you think through expenses, you keep an eye on currency translation, keep an eye on the accounting, the revenue recognition accounting standard and then the absence of restructuring, underlying expenses were up 4%. That's the [indiscernible] given the revenue momentum in the business, but came in just a little more than it may in a typical quarter. So we had some of the ramp-up cost, as you mentioned, of new business, right? And that kind of has some ebbs and flows. But as you imagine as you bring on new business, before you bring it on, you've got to run in parallel. Before you run in parallel, you got to set up. Some of that is technology cost, which is typically expense. Some of that is people, some of that is underlying processing. And so there are periods where one quarter or even two quarters, we can pick up expense in advance of the revenues.","And then we also had, I noted, some higher sub-custody fees, if you noticed, emerging markets were up almost 30%. That's where sub custodians are. And so end up being a little higher than this particular quarter. So anyway, there is some variability, I think, in the revenue \u2013 on the fee revenue line, there is a little bit of variability in the expense line. We're pleased with the overall momentum. And as I said at the end of my prepared remarks, we're committed to our full year fee operating leverage within that range that we have provided at this point.","Alex Blostein","Okay. So no real change there. And then the second question for me, I guess, just around some of the NIR dynamics. I guess one, maybe you would \u2013 could hit on the deposit betas. Obviously, costing can be pretty well controlled in the U.S. side. For quite some times frankly as well. So Maybe talk a little bit about what were the deposit betas on the U.S. side and why they're so much lower than for your peers? And then maybe just to kind of round up the whole conversation around processing fee versus NIR. Do I hear you correctly that, I guess, if the FX cost go away, roughly $10 million-ish drag this quarter, so processing fees steps up about $10 million but then NIR goes down $10 million.","Eric Aboaf","Let me take those questions in the order that you asked. So betas came in reasonably well relative to expectations. So we've been signaling that they've been floating up. We had betas in the U.S. in the low 40% range, which is kind of right where we had thought they would come. That's up from last, I guess, the last rates hike we had. We had it about 25%. So we're kind of in \u2013 we've been moving up in line with our expectations. The part of the balance sheet that performs better than expectation was actually that transition from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing, was actually slower than we've continued to model.","And so if you think about interest-bearing betas are at expectations or even though a bit better. But total deposit betas, right? Because that's what really matters, that's come in better than expected. And I think if I step back, I think that's in the range of what we've seen in peers. I think you see some types of deposits are \u2013 that corporate deposit money, very high beta. Or the well management money, very high beta. The retail is very low beta and we tend to be in the middle as a custody bank. And so we've been pleased with those results.","And finally, just on the FX swaps, that's \u2013 you've got it right. They \u2013 instead of being in NIR, that FX swap cost, that ended up in processing fees. If they had qualified for hedge accounting, they would've been in the other line. I think going forward, we \u2013 our intention is certainly to put as much as possible into the NII line by making sure they qualify for hedge accounting. But even more importantly, our perspective is, we should bring down the volumes of FX swaps. They were up at the \u2013 the kind of $15 billion to $20 billion level. They're now in the $10 billion to $15 billion level. And actually trending at the lower end of that range. Our intention in the coming quarter is to bring down even further. And as we've trimmed the investment portfolio by trimming the dollar portion of the investment portfolio on non-HQLA side, that actually, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, can actually bring down the swaps further.","So our perspective is to align the balance sheet over time, so that it's as currency matched as possible. That'll bring the swap cost down. And in fact, it'll give us, over time, the ability to take advantage of swap dislocations and actually do a little bit better depending \u2013 one way or the other.","Alex Blostein","Got it, great. Thanks for taking all the questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Maybe just to go back \u2013 one more on the balance sheet. The end of period balance sheet, obviously, was a lot higher. As a big step \u2013 I mean a big difference from the average balance sheet. I know there's always a lot of quarter end noise. But maybe, Eric, if you can comment on whether you think that reverts and we should look at the sort of the trend line on the average balance sheet. And also on the non-interest-bearing side, that spiked up. It looks like about \u2013 by about $10 billion. So just want to make sure we're normalizing that. And then on the swap, I think that's out of the non-U.S. deposit side, the $22 million if I'm not mistaken. And would that make it more like an 18 basis point core rate instead of a 7 basis point core rate on that?","Eric Aboaf","Let me start on the balance sheet. And then I'd \u2013 actually to clarify the swap question a little bit more. On the balance sheet, we do get, on a daily basis and then a end of quarter basis, we do get higher deposit balances. And if you think about the very largest of our asset management and pension clients, that is quite typical. I don't think this quarter was any different than the other quarter ends other than it ended on a Good Friday. And that, in some cases, creates a little more cash on our balance sheet. But there's nothing \u2013 there was nothing unique about the quarter end which signals any changes really on the average balance sheet.","The average balance sheet, as I described, I think is moving in the right direction. I think we've got good client engagement. We've got a good sharing of the benefits of the rate rises with our clients and we continue to engage them in making sure that that's fair on both sides. And as I said earlier, our perspective is our balance sheet. If there is something we can put to work for the benefit of our clients, we're going to keep doing that. That's a nice way to supplement the fee revenue that we have in this business.","Do you want to just clarify a little more on your second question?","Brian Bedell","Yes, all I did was added the $22 million of the swap cost to the non-interest, I'm sorry, to the non-U.S. deposit line. And that would take that rate from 7 basis points I think you published in your average balance sheet to that 18 basis points to sort of establish a core rate. Is that accurate? Is that \u2013 am I \u2013 is the geography correct in where I'm putting now?","Eric Aboaf","Let me \u2013 why don't we have the IR team follow up off-line. I think you're \u2013 there is a two parts of the answer to that question. First, the FX swap cost were $15 million this quarter and they were a $7 million benefit a year ago. So the $22 million I called out, the delta year-on-year. So you've got to adjust for the absolutes. And then we can work with you on the line item part of the balance sheet. I think directionally, it should go against the non-U.S. domicile depositors. I'll remind you, this is a domiciled view of depositors, not the currency view. Sometimes, those are similar. Sometimes, those are not. So you've got to be careful there. And we do have some extra footnotes at the bottom of that average balance sheet page of the supplement to try to help. But why don't we just do that offline with you and help with the modeling.","Brian Bedell","Yes, sure. Perfect. And then the follow-up would be on backup to the wins, what the $1.3 trillion, sounds like the bulk of that is in two clients, Jay. Sometimes I know you \u2013 I don't know if you've announced the actual clients. It'd be great if you could say those. If not, the \u2013 just understanding, once again, the nature of that business. I think you mentioned one is a mutual funds accounting administration. And I forget, did you say the other was a mid-office? And effectively, from an AUC level or AUA level, it looks like it offsets the BlackRock loss and should we be thinking of this coming in, overall, as a higher yield than the BlackRock was?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, let me take that, Brian. We \u2013 we're not in a position to name the names. But you have it right that there are a couple of meaty transactions which make up the bulk of that $1.3 million. And they're both kind of multidimensional. I described one as multi-geographic of full custody, admin, middle-office. Both existing clients that we had a small piece of. And then the other really represents more of a custody fund accounting fund admin. Mostly U.S. And these will feather in over the course of the next year with component parts along the way till we get it fully implemented.","But I think, I would go back to my point, they do represent what I've been saying all along, which is the \u2013 we're getting more clients that are consolidating with fewer providers. And increasingly the pressure felt by the asset management industry on multiple dimensions, the active to passive, the regulatory pressure they're feeling. Both of these clients, by the way, took advantage of our new capabilities and liquidity, monthly liquidity reporting, which is a new SEC requirement. So I think it's more outsourcing. It's more consolidation. All good news. And we also had our typical range of new business as, I mentioned, across hedge, across ETF, offshore domiciles. So a really good momentum.","You mentioned the BlackRock offset, I mean, they \u2013 all of this kind of offsets, generally, the BlackRock outflow, which I think we said will kind of commence somewhere mid-year and that'll take a year to roll out as well. So it all \u2013 collectively, it gives us greater confidence in our ability to meet the guidance that we provided on service fee growth rates for 2018.","Brian Bedell","And is it fair to say it's a richer revenue yield than the BlackRock loss?","Jay Hooley","It's a real mix, Brian. It wouldn't be sensible for me to try to break that down.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Fair enough, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. Maybe just following up on that. I guess, Jay, what's your sense of sort of your active discussions or pipeline right now? Do you feel like it's stronger than it has been? Just kind of get a sense of the environment. Obviously, you had a very good quarter today on a couple of big wins. So how do we think about your pipeline and thoughts on it going forward?","Jay Hooley","I would say, Jim, it's been steady and quite positive. I don't \u2013 these two transactions maybe a little bit of an outlier. But we continue to see opportunities across the spectrum. And we'll continue to be positioned, whether it's the alternative world, the ETF world or traditional fund world. Folks consolidating, doing more. The more outsourcing piece, which Brian's question got into a little bit. There's more middle-office activity. There is increasing interest in having us wire together the back office and the middle-office. Through DataGX, we're offering new database analytics services. I mentioned the liquidity stress testing. So the environment is such that not only asset managers but also asset owners, big pension funds \u2013 our craving more outsourcing, more analytics, more ability to respond to regulatory requirements.","So you might say at, one level, it\u2019s may extent that there is a lot of pressure in our client set. And that with normal pressures back to us. But it's also \u2013 it also comes with pretty steady opportunity to do more for them. And some of the referenced spend on technology is designed to stay ahead of the new product opportunities, which are pretty vast as well. So strong, broad environment for new business. No real change. I don't see it leading up be there.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, that's really helpful. And then maybe for Eric, to be a dead horse on the balance sheet. But you guys were the only one of your peers to see deposits grow and grow pretty significantly quarter-over-quarter at period end. You're sort of signaling maybe continued growth in average assets when others are signaling declines. So is it \u2013 are you competing on price? I mean how do we think about what you're seeing and how you're attracting those deposits versus what your peers are seeing?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, Jim, there is some, I think, part of \u2013 there are a couple of things going on. There is the quarter-end spikes versus the averages. There is a natural seasonality in the deposits as well that I think some of the others have referenced, January, February, tends to be higher. And then March a little lighter. So there is that trend, which I heard mentioned outside and we obviously see some version of that are custody books are similar enough. So I wouldn't read too much into the end of periods or the monthly, I mean deposits tend to have and flow.","The discussions we've had with clients are not strictly on price. I mean they shouldn't be and we don't want them to be and in fact clients \u2013 if that's not the client that we are looking for and vice versa. Because that it ends up being hot money, I mean, we do tier pricing, right? Appropriately for larger clients versus smaller ones, we differentiate dollars and other currencies. There are relationships there that we engage in, but it's part of the relationship. It's part of all clients have immediate cash that move them around all the time. They have cash that\u2019s somewhat stable. There\u2019s some cash actually sleep into some money market funds, so we support to our asset management arm.","They all have a waterfall of cash and cash availability and our perspective is we should engage with them on that, but prices are result of a lot of other things. It tends to not be something we need it with and we won\u2019t need with it. And in fact, if you look at the underlying pricing and betas and so forth that we described in the U.S. market, which is easiest for all of you to take a look at it, we've actually been disciplined on that deposit pricing and our view as we should continue to do that.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, you're saying it's really just incremental demand for you guys. No change in how you're pricing the business? So that's great. Thanks.","Eric Aboaf","Yes.","Operator","Next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","Hi, I think, I\u2019m going to state of cognitive dissonance over your results. If you can help me out. On the negative side, I mean, you had project Beacon for a few years. And Jay, you've had restructuring all decade. And it's great to hear Beacon savings. But then you have all these expenses for the new business wins and compensation and tax spend. And I thought on purpose of Beacon was to able to put more business on more efficiently and headcount is up 7% year-over-year. That way surpasses its peered, experience growth, certainly at more than I think some had expected this quarter. So that's the negative feeling I have.","I guess on the other hand, the positive feeling is double-digit organic client growth in the first quarter, which is great. So I'm trying to reconcile those two thoughts, and I think the answer comes in what you said about the lag between adding new business and getting all the revenues from that. I can't remember when that's had this much of an impact before. So if you can at least quantify the extra expenses this quarter, what kind of revenues you expect or give a little bit of color on that, that would be helpful.","Jay Hooley","Sure. Happy to do that, Mike. This is Jay. And I'll quickly wrap this to Eric. We don't measure life by a quarter. We're confidently investing. We're bringing on new clients. Beacon is a multi-year journey. We're tracking against operating leverage goal as we said a few times, we are determined to achieve our fee operating goal in 2018. So things can come and go in a quarter. But we're investing in this business. And we're investing to bring on new clients. We're investing to make sure we have those products that ultimately will differentiate and allow us to continue to grow. And that's not just an asset servicing, that's an asset management.","So as Eric referenced and he'll go over again, he can get some episodic revenue and expense situations in a quarter. But we're thrilled with the 5% operating leverage. We're thrilled with our top line. We're pretty happy about our market based activity and the revenues that that's driving. And we're going to make sure that we spend what we need to spend in order to bring those clients in successfully and stay ahead of the pack with regard to completing in these businesses. But, Eric, you might want to?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, Mike, I might just add to that, as I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks both on some of the Q&A, right. The expenses do have a little bit of variability to them and we talk about the ramp up cost, those come and go and that's kind of the installation, right. And some of that can\u2019t be quiet, Beaconize the way, because it takes custom effort to plugs client in, and especially some of our largest clients, remember are acquired for spoke in unique, and so connecting them some effort. I mentioned the sub-custard fees, which were higher this quarter as emerging markets as we sell more flows in emerging markets. We ended up with more volumes there and the market levels take fluent in. And as you say, we continue to invest carefully on the tax spend line, you see us float up purposely because we see headroom on the revenues. We want to spend some on the \u2013 we want to spend some on for client functionality and product development and so forth.","I will remind you and the others that first quarter expenses typically are up relative to fourth quarter, right, by about $150 million because of that seasonal effect, the differed incentive comp which comes through, in one way, once a year. So just keep an eye on that as you think about the modeling, right? This is not the new run rate this is exactly not what it is. And then finally, you mentioned the headcount. It's something we actively manage. Overall headcount is up, as you pointed out, 6% to 7% range. High cost location headcount is actually down 3%, which is a purposeful movement from the \u2013 some of our geographies to others. We found the really strong capabilities in our global hubs, which we have around the world in China, India, Poland. And so that's another part of the Beacon effort. But you won't see that in the nominal numbers because of the transition in kind of bubble headcount that you create floats up.","Mike Mayo","So one more attempt, can you size at all the disconnect between the extra expenses in the new business? I mean, is it bigger than bread box, is it material? And also, did any asset management business come along with some of the custody wins?","Eric Aboaf","I think there's always going to be some expense and revenue variability. I think one way to think about it, Mike, is we gave an operating leverage range for the full year, right? That we committed to, 75 basis points to 150 basis points on a fee operating leverage basis. So on a full year basis, you can imagine there is 75 basis points of variability. On a particular quarter, there can easily be variability of 4 percentage point on expenses, right? One way or the other. And that's just the envelope in which we operate. And what we're trying to do is do the right thing by the business over time by quarter and by year. But we want to do that in a considerate manner.","Jay Hooley","And Mike, just on the \u2013 did any asset management business come along this. No, because most of these bigger deals were asset managers themselves as supposed to asset owners. They build us, applicable as a asset management prospect.","Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, Jay, good morning, Eric. Jay, can you share with us on these business wins that you had this quarter, which of course, were outsized? And you shared already that, as the customers dug into the way you guys are operating, they like even more of what they saw. Can you now extrapolate that to pricing? Are you able to price these types of products better or is it still \u2013 I know pricing has always been competitive for as long as you've been at State Street. Or of us are just as competitive as always?","Jay Hooley","Yes, let me try to unpack that, Gerard. I think that as a general theme, it's always been true that the more complicated the transaction is, the better the pricing. And that may sound counterintuitive. But I think when you have commoditized activity throughout the bid, there's a lot of people that can compete. And when there is a lot of people, pricing gets more difficult. The \u2013 I'll just give you a couple of it been yet, the one deal that we talked about crosses three different geographies. And it's very complicated. It's a very involved service model where you've got a trading desk in the couple of different locations.","You've got product servicing capability in other three locations, it's middle office, back office. So that narrows the field as far as the number of folks that can compete. And as a result, pricing gets better. And I'd say that's the theme generally holds. I think in other vignettes would be \u2013 when someone's doing this work on their own and they're making a decision through outsource it, which is another one of the situations that I had referenced. And that gets a little bit more complicated because try to understand what once internal cost are becomes a factor.","But I would say, in that case, it was really less about cost, more about the \u2013 they wanted to go with the risky business of doing fund accounting globally at scale across a number of different products. So I think it still holds true that the more involved the activity is by geographies and bilayers of service moving back to front office, generally the better pricing gets. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful.","Gerard Cassidy","No, no. That is. Thank you. And then, Eric, you gave us some good color on your capital ratios and you mentioned about the RWA growth due to higher client overdrafts. A couple of questions of that. Do you know what drove the client overdrafts since they appear to be pretty material since the CET1 ratio did fall sequentially by a fair amount? And then second, when you look at your net interest revenue numbers, the incremental growth that you saw, how much was due to those overdrafts?","Eric Aboaf","Sure, Gerard. The overdraft, that totaled about $5 billion on our undrawn committed lines. That\u2019s not a large number. But it\u2019s large relative to what\u2019s typical. We\u2019ve had spikes in overdrafts. You always have them when there are either \u2013 sometimes \u2013 when you have storms and weather events, when you have holidays. This one in particular, if you remember we had Good Friday at the end of the quarter. The markets aren\u2019t \u2013 half the markets are open, half are not open. And so what happens is you kind of have a little bit of a discontinuity for clients who end up ahead in one part of their funds, short on the other and so draw on their lines.","Which is why, to be honest, those lines exist. We\u2019re there for our clients. And are there, delighted to help them as needed. It was literally two, three, four, five clients, so a handful. We know them well. We\u2019ve supported them. And they\u2019ve been good to us. So it\u2019s the kind of thing that will just occasionally happen. We don\u2019t expect it every quarter end. But occasionally, when something is in the environment, like in this case, it was a holiday and a quarter end, you have an effect. In terms of NII, there is not a big effect, because remember NII is driven by average balances over the course of one quarter, right? So all 90 days. Not one day.","So this wouldn\u2019t have had a big impact positive to NII. This is really a client accommodation that we\u2019re doing. And we\u2019re there for our clients. And one of the reasons we\u2019ve got such a strong balance sheet is so that we can accommodate clients like that. And that\u2019s the kind of expectation they have, for example, on some of the \u2013 some of those larger clients that Jay described have, for a custodial banks like us.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. I appreciate the help. Thank you.","Eric Aboaf","Sure.","Operator","This question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You touched on some of the proposed regulatory changes earlier. Can you elaborate a bit on, if we get the CCAR changes plus the SLR changes as proposed, what you think your new binding constraints on capital would be?","Eric Aboaf","Geoffrey, it\u2019s Eric. I mean that\u2019s been a well studied and modeled endeavor. And I say that in a nice way, because it\u2019s obviously important to us. It\u2019s obviously important to many of you and I think your team and other teams have tried to take that the new CCAR, NPR, the one with the stress capital buffer. And say look, if you had a reformatted stage 3 and all the other bank results back to the last CCAR, how would it laid out. I think as you know, our CCAR binding constraints or let me step back our binding constraints today from a capital perspective start with Tier 1 leverage then depending on kind of where we\u2019re it could be either CET1 or SLR. But that\u2019s kind of core Tier 1 leverage is the binding constraint.","I think the early modeling that that we\u2019ve seen and I think the modeling that the industry has done is not particularly different than ours, is that with the FCB and the implementation FCB across the various those five core capital ratios, it seems like the binding constraint will move from the standard Tier 1 leverage to CET1. That should create some amount of capacity. It\u2019s hard to model it precisely, but it seems to create some amount of capacity.","And I think others have observed it kind of does the right thing for banks, which is risk related assets should actually be the dominant capital constraint for any bank, right? That\u2019s what a bank is about. The leverage ratio, so there is Tier 1 leverage or SLR should be the backstop. And I think the proposal is both well-intentioned, well designed. There are obviously some refinements that I'm sure we will suggest now there is we'll suggest, but clearly going in the right direction.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you. And maybe just another quick one. No outlook slide this time. I know you kind of touched on the outlook in the comments. It feels like there's always been an outlook slide in the State Street deck. So I would love to hear, while you decided not to include that in this time.","Jay Hooley","Sure. There's really no messaging at all. I think the full year outlook that we gave in January is fully operative. It was operative in February when we went to an industry conference that was \u2013 it\u2019s operative now. I think what we\u2019re going to do is keep it simple when the outlook changes, will do a new slide and thereby, kind of adjust our messaging. What I will do and I did verbally this quarter is if quarter-on-quarter there are always some seasonality or other swings, I\u2019ll signals those verbally, but no message at all. We're just trying to keep the slide deck compact save an extra tree in the process and \u2013 but the full year outlook commitment that we've made in January, in our minds is a commitment. And our intention is and \u2013 and we have confidence that we'll deliver that.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you. Taking one slide off is definitely appreciated. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hey, good morning.","Jay Hooley","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","I just have two questions. One is on the proposed changes that you just discussed. It seems like you have two potential options, obviously, you can do a mix of each, but two basic options. One is, you have more capacity to take in deposits, grow the balance sheet even further or the other one is reduce the press outstanding. And you've got some of the callable press that are out there today. Do you have a preference for either one or could you give us a sense of percentage that you'd want to do with either one?","Eric Aboaf","Betsy, it's Eric. I think at this point, we will pretty mature to make a choice there. I think the rules are \u2013 the rules as they stand are obviously constraining in a certain way. I think the actual be the CCAR CV proposal and SLR proposals move in the right direction. There's also the TLAC proposal, which we think is constructive. I mean, not huge amounts, but at least constructive directionally.","I think what we'll have to see is how they all come together and remember they may come together little differently in each CCAR period, right. Because the notion of the stress and how the stress impacts us will be different and also, we don't know the Fed models are still fairly opaque, right. We don't know, how the really modeled the balance sheet, how they really model the PPNR given that the signal they're going to change and not grow the balance sheets as much. And so every one of those \u2013 I don't mean to avoid the question, but I think you've got the right levers, which is we could add to the deposit base or other balance sheet kind of leverage balance sheet in terms of activities like some sec lending or enhanced custody qualified.","We could reduced the press and some of them are callable today, some of them will be callable next year and then year after and so forth. If that one is the binding constraint, right, will be disciplined around disciplined around RWAs right. And depending on how much capacity want to create there with as we did this quarter with the changes in non-HQLA in the investment portfolio, which have RWA will be under consideration. So in a way, I think there\u2019s a lot of optionality that this would create and help from views at this point, but in my mind, it\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019ll optimize again it\u2019s a better set of \u2013 I think it\u2019s a better designed set of rules. And we\u2019ll have a view of how to do that from \u2013 I think from a shareholder perspective, which is how do we turn that optimization to higher earnings and earnings growth, how do we turn that into capital and capital return, that\u2019ll be the lends that we\u2019ll use.","Betsy Graseck","And so, your point you just made, okay, actions taken in the quarter are shifting some of the mix in earning assets from securities to loans, for example. That\u2019s CET1 positive? Is that your point?","Eric Aboaf","It\u2019s not dollar-for-dollar, right, because some of those securities are 50% risk-weighted, some closer to 100%. But I\u2019m saying that, that is another lever that we have and in fact if we have the opportunity to trade off client lending right or non-clients securities. There\u2019s clearly a privatization. We have to make sure it comes with good returns or good wallet \u2013 share of wallet from the client. But those are absolutely opportunities that we see and I think what we\u2019re \u2013 because we have we still have non-HQLA in the investment portfolio that always be up to grabs as we optimize for our clients.","Betsy Graseck","How much left is that, non-HQLA in the investment portfolio.","Eric Aboaf","We sold down about $12 billion on a base of $35 billion. So there\u2019s still $20 billion plus.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Thank you.","Eric Aboaf","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Carrier \u2013 our question indeed from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.","Mike Carrier","All right. Thanks guys. Eric, just one quick one. When I look at the fee revenue growth year-over-year you guys had the percent like 5% ex-FX. And then I think ex the revenue recognition accounting that\u2019s 3%, so maybe around 2%. And I know the processing other that kind of add like 3% \u2013 like that could take that 2% to 3% or 4%. It\u2019s seems like that still maybe on the later side just given the market strength that we saw over the last 12 months and then also the volatility that we saw in the quarter that helped the trading side. So I guess, I\u2019m just trying to figure out, is there anything else that maybe we\u2019re missing \u2013 maybe muted the growth? Or is it really just all that processing and other? Because it still seems maybe a little bit later than you would have expected.","Eric Aboaf","Yes, Mike it\u2019s Eric. Let me \u2013 I mean, I think Page 7 of the earnings deck that you all have is probably good one to take a quick look. And I think the \u2013 we\u2019re quite circumspect and how we show fee revenues. We show with and without currency translation, we actually do it on the slide so you can find them and I just encouraging to make sure all the comparisons are apples-to-apples and you\u2019ve got enough footnotes here to adjust for revenue recognition.","I think the single biggest driver of our revenues is the servicing fees, right? That\u2019s half of our total revenues, $5 billion a year, and $11 billion, $10 billion to $11 billion of revenue. So I think we\u2019re quite pleased with the 10% normal growth there, the 6% adjusted for currency translation. There is no meaningful revenue recognition in there. So that\u2019s quite solid. And that last year, right that\u2019s half our revenue, last year was up 4% adjusted for currency on a full year basis, and been in about that range. So we\u2019re pleased with that. Every quarter will be a little different there. But that\u2019s a good performance.","I think some of the other roles management fees, trading, securities finance came in more less with expectations and I do think processing other is the biggest disconnect remember year ago, we had a gain on sales $30, so that cost up 1.5%. You had the FX swaps delta, which was 22. And then if you still do the comparison between the year-on-year, there is another, in 20, 25 of just small ins and outs that tended to add a positive last year and negative this year.","So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re missing anything. I think there\u2019s just some variability here on that line. And when against this quarter it will tend to neutral in other quarters and positive in still others. So overall I think we feel like there is good momentum in the business. We\u2019re pleased with the results, I think the line item geography was a little bit unfortunate on the FX swaps. But nice way in our minds to start the year, a good step-off and we\u2019re obviously working on the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter.","Mike Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Jay Hooley","Sam, that\u2019s it.","Operator","There are no further questions.","Jay Hooley","Okay, great. Thanks everybody for joining us this morning. We look forward to getting together at the end of the second quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley will speak first, then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our third quarter 2019 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. [Operator Instructions].","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix or slide presentation.","In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligations to update them even if our views change.","And let me turn it over to Ron.","Ronald O\u2019Hanley","Thanks, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 3, we announced our third quarter financial results this morning, reporting EPS and ROE of $1.42 and 9.7%, respectively. Before I go into more detail about our results, I'd like to discuss we're seeing in the macro environment. As one of the world's largest investment service providers, we have a unique window into global capital flows, despite an accommodative monetary policy supporting U.S. equities and global fixed income assets, a significant amount of cash remains on the sidelines. Notwithstanding that, both industry and client flows have improved in recent quarters relative to 2018.","Relative to the year ago period, State Street's total revenue fell 3% reflecting lower interest rates, weaker international average equity market levels and challenging industry conditions, including price compression, partially offset by the positive contributions of Charles River.","When compared to the second quarter, however, total revenue increased 1% driven by higher servicing fees, stronger net interest income and better foreign exchange revenue. We are encouraged by the direction of our servicing fee revenue and believe that our efforts to improve revenue performance are having the intended impact. We are making progress, we are not yet where I would like to see us as a business and reigniting servicing fee growth remains a priority.","Assets under custody and administration increased slightly quarter-on-quarter to $32.9 trillion, and we are pleased with the level of new wins during the quarter of $1 trillion, while assets yet to be installed increased to $1.2 trillion. At Global Advisors, we also had a good quarter. Assets under management increased by 1% quarter-on-quarter to just under $3 trillion, supported by higher period end-market levels and relatively strong ETF and cash inflows. I'm particularly pleased by the third quarter of consecutive net inflows.","We are making good progress across the enterprise, but we are not yet hitting our full potential, which is why reigniting servicing fee growth remains a top priority. I would like to provide you now with an update on some of the strategic progress we are making to improve our revenue growth as well as our operational efficiency. First, regarding reigniting servicing fee revenue growth, we are seeing some tangible progress as demonstrated by this quarter's performance, part of this initial success is due to a strengthened focus on our clients. We have made some appointments in key strategic areas of focus, such as what the recent announcement of our new Head of U.S. Asset Owner Relationship Management. In addition, we have expanded our management committee in recent months adding to the diversity of our leadership and talent. Furthermore, we are taking steps to improve client service quality by reassessing and leveraging the capabilities of our newly combined operations and technology division.","Regarding operational efficiency, expense management remains a key focus for all of us. As a result of ongoing process reengineering and automation efforts, we have been able to reduce high-cost location head count by more than 2,700 year-to-date, already exceeding our initial target of 1,500 by year-end.","Furthermore, our $400 million underlying expense savings program for full year 2019 has already achieved $275 million in total year-over-year growth savings in the first 9 months of the year. You will recall that last quarter, I announced that we are in the process of updating our core business strategy to help us return to stronger revenue growth as well as conducting a fundamental reassessment of our technology ecosystem in order to improve our operational efficiency in the near term. This reassessment is underway and we have taken early actions in this regard.","In recent weeks, we have rationalized some of our technology head count. There are a number of areas we are examining to create better technology outcomes at lower cost, with an increased emphasis on development projects and innovation that have a direct client service benefit and strength in our resiliency. We continue to expect that we'll be able to provide further detail on our reassessment later this fall.","Our vision remains becoming the leading asset servicer, asset manager and data insight provider to the owners and managers of the world's capital. Our front-to-back platform, which we have branded Alpha is key to achieving that vision in our financial targets over the medium term. This Alpha strategy is facilitating deeper client relationships, allowing us to increasingly become their essential partner, while delivering operational efficiencies to both our clients and State Street. Our front-to-back asset servicing platform continues to have a strong pipeline with a number of clients in exclusive negotiations. The level of client engagements remains at an encouraging level. Regarding shareholder return, following our strong performance under the 2019 CCAR stress test, we recently announced an 11% increase to our quarterly common dividend to $0.52 per share and returned approximately $690 million to shareholders, including $500 million of common share repurchases during the third quarter. We expect the changes to regulatory capital requirements will support our ability to return additional capital to our shareholders in the future.","To conclude, our immediate focus is on delivering world-class client service, while finding ways to reignite revenue growth and generate expense reductions through sustainable improvements in our operating model. We are making progress in all of these areas.","And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.","Eric Aboaf","Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Page 4. On the top left panel, we show our GAAP results as well as certain results ex-notable items in the bottom for those of you who want to see some of the underlying trends. On the right panel, we summarize notable items, which amounted to $45 million pretax or $0.09 per share in the third quarter, consisting of $27 million in acquisition and restructuring cost primarily from Charles River as well as $18 million in legal and related expenses.","The A&R costs are in line with our expectations and are helping us deliver on anticipated CRD expense synergies. For period-on-period comparisons, recall that we had no notables in third quarter '18, but we did have $12 million of A&R on a pretax basis equal of $0.03 per share in the second quarter, primarily due to Charles River.","Turning to Slide 5, we saw period-end AUC\/A levels decline 3% year-on-year and up slightly quarter-on-quarter. On a year-on-year move was driven by the impact of a previously announced client transition, partially offset by higher spot market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, the modest AUC\/A increase was mainly due to higher spot market levels and client flows, partially offset by the same previously announced client transition. In regards to the transition, recall that this was immaterial to quarterly revenues since the end of 2018, and we do not expect any further material revenue drag. AUM levels increased 5% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter on just about $3 trillion driven by higher U.S. market levels and strong net flows. Third quarter '19 saw net flows of approximately $13 billion, driven by cash products and ETFs for third consecutive quarter of positive inflows.","Moving to Slide 6. Servicing fees were down 5% year-on-year, but down just 3% year-over-year ex-FX. As Ron discussed, while challenging industry conditions persist, the pace of quarter-over-quarter servicing fee headwinds continue to moderate in third quarter with this quarter's results showing a sequential increase, primarily driven by higher average market levels, net new business and some market-based catch-up accruals. And while 2 quarters are not yet a trend, we continue to believe that the actions we have taken since late last year, including the rollout of our new client coverage model and the newly formed executive review committee to strengthen pricing discipline are having an impact. Nevertheless, as Ron also mentioned, we remain unsatisfied with these servicing fee results and recognize that still more needs to be done to reignite revenue growth.","On the bottom right panel of this page, we've again included some sales performance indicators to provide a little more texture. As you can see, AUC\/A wins totaled $1 trillion in third quarter, which also raised our assets to be installed. The sizable win this quarter demonstrates the benefit of our scale and capabilities, including a mandate from an existing large client as we continue to grow our relationships.","Turning to Slide 7, let me discuss the other revenue line. Beginning with management fees, third quarter revenue was down 6% year-on-year, driven by the ongoing impact of the late 2018 outflows and mix changes away from higher fee products, partially offset by higher average U.S. equity market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were up 1% driven by higher average U.S. equity markets, increased head count and good inflows.","FX trading was down 1% year-on-year and up 4% quarter-on-quarter as the business benefited from the volume and volatility uptick in August relative to the prior quarter. Securities finance revenues were down 9% year-on-year, modestly reflecting the CCAR-related balance sheet optimization made in the second half of 2018 and down 8% quarter-on-quarter due mainly to the absence of 2Q seasonal activity. Underlying this seasonality, we are seeing some stability as our new optimization actions will position us for growth as we see client demand rebuild.","Finally, processing fees were up year-over-year reflecting approximately $77 million in revenue contribution from CRD. Quarter-on-quarter, processing fees were down 15%, driven by lower market-related adjustments as well as lower CRD revenue due to the timing of new business and renewals.","Moving to Slide 8. You will see in the top left panel a summary of CRD's operating performance in the third quarter, generating $85 million of stand-alone revenues and $56 million of operating expenses, resulting in $29 million of pretax income. The business also saw $5 million in new client bookings during the quarter, all external. While revenues were a bit lower this quarter due to the timing of new business and renewals, the business continues to perform in line with our expectations. The uptick in operating expense in the quarter was anticipated and driven by a planned increase in investment spending to support new business growth.","I would again remind this audience the lumpiness inherent in the 606 revenue reporting standards and not to read across any one quarter's results.","Turning to the upper right panel on this page, we wanted to, again, provide you an update on our active client discussions, regarding CRD. As you can see here, our client discussions continue to advance. We're now actively engaged with approximately 130 clients, representing approximately $41 trillion in assets. As anticipated these dialogues are resulting in a variety of revenue opportunities, and we remain confident in the revenue and cost synergy goals announced at the time of the acquisition.","On the bottom 2 panels of the page, we've again listed some of the growth and synergy milestones achieved this quarter. As mentioned earlier in the call, our front-to-back pipeline remains strong as we saw an increased number of clients in exclusive negotiations and expect more announcements to come. These front-to-back deals will also help drive growth in our core servicing business, as they typically come with some combination of custody, accounting and middle office revenues in addition to Charles River specific revenues.","Turning to Slide 9. NII was down 4% year-on-year, with our NIM declining 6 basis points. On a sequential basis, however, our NII was up 5%, with our NIM increasing 4 basis points. The sequential increase in NII was primarily driven by episodic market-related benefits worth about 3 percentage points as well as higher client repo activity and active deposit management. Absent these episodic benefits, NII would have been about up 1% sequentially.","We have been seeing some success in our deposit gathering initiatives with our average total deposits growing for the second straight quarter. These initiatives include a variety of efforts such as suite program minimums, targeting new client segments and adding market rate funding. This active deposit management may help us offset a portion of the impact from deposit rotation in some quarters. We were particularly pleased with our success this quarter in that regard, but we still expect to see continued gradual deposit rotation and the effect of lower long rates.","We also responded quickly to Central Bank rate reductions, both in the U.S. and Europe with appropriately aggressive deposit pricing actions.","And finally, on the earning asset side, we continue to target careful growth in client lending in a modestly larger investment portfolio. On Slide 10, we've again provided a view of expenses this quarter, ex notables. So the trends are readily visible. Year-on-year, our expenses, excluding notable items were up 2%, but down 1% excluding Charles River and down slightly quarter-on-quarter.","We've also now seen 3 consecutive quarters of total head count declines, driven by the ongoing reduction in our senior ranks and the previous hiring freeze implemented earlier this year that have reduced our high-cost location head count by more than 2,700 year-to-date, exceeding our original target of 1,500 by year-end. The cumulative impact can be seen in our compensation and benefits line as it is now down 2% year-over-year or down 4%, excluding Charles River. As we've been able to move, we're up to lower cost global hub and achieve greater efficiencies via automation while actively improving client service levels.","Moving to Slide 11, we wanted to show a full year view of underlying expenses, which excludes Charles River, categorized by IT, operations as well as business segments and corporate functions, though you can see where we're delivering expense reductions and where we still see incremental opportunities going forward. As you can see, due to our ongoing cost management efforts for 2019, we expect to achieve year-on-year expense declines in 2 of these 3 major areas, with significant efficiencies realized in operations as well as our business and corporate functions. As we said last quarter, the growth in our IT spend is too high and that is where we are in the midst of the top to bottom review, Ron mentioned earlier in his remarks.","In fact in IT, we have already identified a number of optimization opportunities with this technology reassessment and have taken some early actions, including rationalizing of approximately 275 staff this quarter. We remain confident that we can continue to realize the incremental benefits from automation initiatives, while delivering improved risk quality and expect to share more detail on this assessment and its potential efficiency opportunities before year-end.","Moving to the right side of the page, we remain on track to achieve $400 million in expense savings this year having already realized $275 million in savings year-to-date, we have made some resource discipline and process engineering efforts, resulting in an anticipated 1.5% reduction in our full year underlying expense base year-on-year, which surpasses our original start of the year 1% reduction target.","Moving to Slide 12, our capital ratios remain largely consistent quarter-on-quarter, with our standardized CET1 at a 11.3% and our Tier 1 leverage at 7.4%. We returned a total of approximately $690 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter, $500 million of which were share repurchases. The $690 million is a 45% increase from the $475 million returned in 2Q '19, as we began to execute on our 2019 CCAR plan and deliver on our priority of significantly increasing our capital return to shareholders, and the $690 million represents a 130% of net income available to common shareholders.","On the left side of the page, you will see that our investment portfolio grew sequentially as we reinvested cash and maintained significant CCAR stress capacity. I would again note that we are confident in our capital position believe that we have created some headroom and that has proposed changes deliberate ratio rules are being finalized, we will continue to examine associated capital optimization opportunities.","Moving to our summary and outlook on Page 13. We were pleased to see the continued moderation in servicing fee headwinds during the quarter and our global effects business provided better-than-expected revenue results. NII increased 5% sequentially driven by some episodic market-related benefits, while we saw deposits stabilize in the quarter due to our deposit gathering initiatives. Deposits are tough to predict, of course, quarter-on-quarter and prevailing rates continue to trend downwards. The underlying expense reduction we've achieved to date demonstrates our ability to further bend the cost curve as we've now reduced our total head count 2% year-to-date and are on track to achieve this year's updated expense savings target of $400 million.","Finally, we began to deliver on our priority of increased capital return to shareholders and believe we are well positioned to continue to optimize our capital stack consistent with regulatory development.","In closing, I'd like to cover our 4Q '19 outlook. On a sequential quarter basis, we currently expect fee revenues to be up 1% to 2% driven by CRD, assuming third quarter '19 end of period market levels. We expect servicing fees to be flattish in spite of the third quarter catch-up accruals as pricing pressure continues to stabilize. While management fees are expected to be up 1 percentage or 2 driven by the carryover of strong inflows from this quarter. And while markets are always difficult to forecast, we currently expect our mark of the businesses to be down somewhat assuming lower levels of volatilities than third quarter, while processing fees are expected to be up sequentially driven by fourth quarter seasonality in Charles River and the absence of some market-related adjustments.","In regards to NII, we will continue to see downward pressure from the declining long rates and with another rate cut, we would expect to be down 3% to 5% on a sequential basis, excluding the $20 million of episodic benefits we experienced in third quarter.","On expenses, we expect expenses, excluding notable items and including CRD, to be flat to sequentially. At the same time, we remain confident in achieving our full year underlying expense reduction of 1.5% year-on-year, excluding both notable items in Charles River.","And as we mentioned previously, we are conducting a fundamental review of our technology cost structure and expect that more information to share with you later this year.","Finally, we expect to see the full year tax rate come in at the lower end of our tax guidance of 17% to 19% for the full year.","And with that, let me turn the call back over to Ron.","Ronald O\u2019Hanley","Thank you, Eric. Operator, let's open to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein","So maybe starting with the question around servicing fees, obviously nice to see commentary around migrating pricing pressure again here. Maybe give us an update where that stands, I think, 4% down is kind of how we're thinking about 2019. As you look into 2020, how do you expect these pricing pressures to evolve?","Eric Aboaf","Alex, it's Eric. It's a little early to take a full year look at 2020, but I think we've started to see a couple of quarters here some moderation in 2019. So in second quarter, we've again seen some of those early signs. They continued this quarter as well. And as we have reviewed the book of some of the larger than historical pricing concessions, you recall we were tracking the top 100 clients. We're now through 75%, 80% of that book. And then that gives us an ability to begin to look forward into fourth quarter and even into the first quarter of next year. And as we look forward into those time periods, we continue to expect the moderation to continue. That's the kind of the indicator.","So I think if we step back and ask the broader question for what's driving some of those changes, I think there are really 2 things. I think on one hand, we're beginning to see the effects of our coverage teams and how we have upgraded our coverage force to better client -- better cover clients and bring together the full set of discussions in one place. And then with our executive review pricing committee, we've actually brought up the pricing decisioning to literally just a handful of senior executives. And that's given us the ability to influence the amount and the direction of that -- those pricing adjustments. And at the same time, actually, we're collaborating with our clients around where there is incremental business to be brought on. And I think what we're starting to see is the effect of that senior control and engagement have its effect on the revenues in these quarters.","Alexander Blostein","Got it. And then my second question is around servicing fees, again, maybe a little bit more specifically related to the quarter, it's obviously $1 trillion in wins is a big number, $1.2 trillion pipeline is a big number. Definitely appreciate the effort to sort of communicate the drivers of servicing fees in a more transparent fashion. But in the past, we've seen big AUM, AUC numbers, but the translation sort of into fees have been sort of underwhelming. So can we talk through maybe the impact of these wins on the revenues, and ultimately, the timing of when that's going to hit?","Eric Aboaf","Alex, it's Eric, again. I think as you would expect in our business, our business is lumpy, and it also comes with a range of different wins and new business engagements. I think, it's hard to predict for any one quarter, what the effect of the -- on future revenues. And I think we've been quite clear in the path and sometimes we have large wins that start with one particular product, sometimes we have larger or smaller wins that come on with multiple products and sometimes, we see the follow-on activity. So it's hard to directly translate.","And I think the other texture that I shared with you is that our business is multifaceted across products and regions. And we've talked before pricing differs by region, emerging markets versus the U.S.; pricing differs by product, some of the cross-border funds versus some of the more typical 40 Act mutual funds. So hard to be emphatic about the exact correlation of revenues. But what I would say in one of the reasons we do track the AUC\/A wins is we think it gives you an indication of client engagement, we're having the amount of client activity and business. And over time, it has -- that will flow into revenues exactly when and how much that's something that you'll see in the coming quarters.","Ronald O\u2019Hanley","Alex, it's Ron. What I would add to that is that we are very encouraged though by that number. There is a large existing client win in there, which reflects the trend that we've talked about for a long time, which is around outsourcing. But also in that number is a broad-base of very high-quality clients that are -- we think are just adding measurably to our book.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","Just a couple of combined deposit rate-related questions. First, just definitionally, the down 3% to 5% next quarter, the base that we start from as we take out the 20 this quarter and then take it down 3% to 5% just making sure?","Eric Aboaf","Glenn, it's Eric. That's correct. That's the way to think about it.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Cool. On the -- if you look at your average non-interest-bearing deposits, they're down 17%, a lot of peers have seen similar numbers, but they're only down 1% quarter-on-quarter. And I'm curious, if you think we're at a more -- we're entering a bottoming stage, this is a more natural percentage of the overall book. Where does that accelerate as we have more rate cuts? Just curious how are you thinking about that?","Eric Aboaf","Glenn, it's Eric. I'd like to see a couple of more quarters here before we make a judgment around the direction of non-interest-bearing deposits. I think, we've seen a consistent reduction, I think, about over the last 2 years in this kind of 15% to -- 18% to 19% range. It's been a little bit lumpy in some of the previous quarters. I think you can look back a year ago, it's a little bit lumpy, up and then lumpy back down and impact the trend. So it's hard to read into one quarter's performance exactly what the future holds.","So I think we'd like to see a couple of more quarters and we'd like to see a couple of more quarters actually at these new prevailing rates because remember part of the driver for the rotation was the higher rates that Fed had brought us to. Now that they've cut rates a couple of times and they're continuing to cut, the differential between non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing becomes smaller. And so that may have an effect as well. So I think we were pleased with the results this quarter on non-interest-bearing, we're pleased with the results on interest-bearing as well, because we're able to manage pricing quite actively as the Fed and the ECB cut rates, and I think we're going to be watching this one closely, I think with everyone else.","Glenn Schorr","Cool. Definitely helpful.","Ronald O\u2019Hanley","And what I would add to that is, it's Ron here, that somewhat analogous to how we're managing servicing fee pricing are, we're managing deposits and deposit pricing at a very intensively at a client-by-client level. So well, nobody is happy with the trends that we're facing in the environment that we're in this. It relates to deposits. I think the team is working very hard to manage these quite intensively.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Actually just wanted to follow-up on Glenn's questions on deposits. So the interest-bearing deposit cost dropped a lot, you referenced that, you talked about how that's becoming integrated. I think you also referenced until we saw the move by this -- the Fed and the move by ECB. Is there a way to parse out the impact by currency, where you're seeing betas shake out in U.S. dollar and in euro? And can you give us a sense about whether there was noise? And if you guys competitively feel as though you are sort of leading the charge? How are you stacking up versus how some of your competitors are responding?","Eric Aboaf","Brennan, it's Eric. Let me take that from a couple of different directions slightly so I think you've asked the currency question and the different kind of areas of pricing on deposits because it is one that we've been working on intensely. And just for context, for you, but for others as well, right as the -- in the last couple of rate increases, we got to a place where deposit betas were rising and we're quite high. And what we've been able to do in this particular quarter, both in the U.S. and international, have actually effectively run with symmetric betas and reduced pricing quite a bit in line with the Fed and the ECB.","As we -- if I were to summarize the beta analysis for the U.S. our betas were about 50%. So we're able to push down deposit rates quite a bit in the U.S. as the U.S. rates came down by the 25 basis points in the last rate move. And then with the ECB rate cut, that was a 10 basis point move. We're able to actually reduce rates even further even more than the 10 basis points because we're really in a scenario in Europe where we're going to be negative and nonnegative temporarily, but negative for a long, long time. And it needs to be a place where we and, I think, all banks actually kind of at least turn fair margins. And so that's been part of our very active management of deposit pricing. And we'll take that kind of approach around the world as we see rate cuts, whether it's in sterling or Canadian dollars or Aussie dollars or in some of the emerging markets as well.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Eric, and then when we think about NII in the guidance, I think you had -- you're talking about a number using the midpoint to get you right around $600 million. And yet this quarter for backing out the onetime, the NII was up nearly 2% linked quarter, and you guys previously taken up your guide to about flattish. So I guess, what I'm curious about is, what is embedded in NII? Do you expect your deposit cost dynamics would be similar to this quarter? And what are you expecting from an asset yield perspective? Can you kind of help us understand the composition of that guide?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, I think, let's take 2Q to 3Q and then we'll fast-forward to 3Q to 4Q because it gives you some perspective. I think ex the market-related adjustments on NII from 2Q to 3Q, we certainly had some down draft from long rate, that's affecting us and other institutions. We actually had a slight uptick from deposits, so that was part of our deposit raising initiative. And we got some benefit from our larger loan book and investment portfolio. And then our repo activity did well as well as we continue to grow some of those balances.","If I then think about that in -- from third quarter or fourth quarter, we're going to continue to get it down draft from our -- from long-term rates, right, that's just playing through and it's an effect that the long rate fall from the last 3, 4 quarters are starting to accumulate, and that's what's -- that's the primary item coming through.","We expect to see some reduction from deposit rotation, because, as I mentioned in the previous question, net interest -- non-interest-bearing deposit rotation will continue. We'll try to offset that, but we'll see. And then obviously, as we -- whether we issue a little bit more debt or make other adjustments from the rest of the portfolio, there's always likely to be a little bit of other effects.","So I think we're on this trend line where lower rates create some -- a trend that is not in our favor. And what you've seen us do is everything we can, whether it's with pricing or balances or asset size to try to offset that, and I think what you'll find is in some quarters, we're able to offset those that longer trend, and other cases, we may not be able to. But that's the -- we're very focused on finding ways and pushing on a number of those levers that we have to find offsets where possible.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","Eric, to follow up on the cost side, I saw your guidance in the deck just that you're expecting flattish cost both on an ex CRD basis and then I think that's what's implied for the with CRD basis. What I wanted to ask you about is, first of all, when do we get to that right run rate for the Charles River extends growth that we've been seeing, #1? And then #2 is, once you get to the $400 million run rate also in the fourth quarter, you had this nice 1.5% decline this year, and you've said that you would be focused on still getting cost down at the core. Can you continue that pace of decline as you look ahead into next year?","Eric Aboaf","Ken, sure. A couple of things, I think on Charles River, we're obviously investing in that business as part of our growth strategy. And I think you've seen the revenue numbers. They tend to be little lumpy. But we're very pleased with the early signs around some of the synergy assumptions that we had in some of the -- some of our acquisition modeling that we had done, that we had shared with you back a year ago. The cost will trend upwards in Charles River. I think costs came in a little more quickly this quarter than in third quarter relatively to second quarter than second quarter versus first quarter. So it will come in ways, but it's all meant to try to drive either sales and sales capacity or the installation engineering that we need because that's historically been a bottleneck for them to be able to recognize revenue literally of bolting it on and providing the necessary integration for clients. So that's what's driving some of the cost there. And we feel like that is, well, those are sort of good cholesterol costs, those are the costs that will drive current and future revenues, and we'll continue to invest accordingly.","If I step back on the broader question of expenses, you've seen and we were purposeful on describing Page 11 that historically I don't think we've been as good as we should have been or we would have liked to have been on cost. Since for the last few years, we've consistently grown our expense base. And as you know, with the 1.5% forecast down this year, this is the first year that we are really bending that curve in a significant way. If it -- when it comes to what we're going to do going forward, I think we've said that we have to continue to work on expenses and productivity, right. There is no other course of action in a productivity focused and a slower growth industry like the one we find ourselves in. And as a result, we're going to continuing to find ways to drive down expenses. And what we've tried to do is enumerate on levers so that you can try to see, you can actually see the range of actions, whether it's the comp and benefits side, whether it's on a nonpersonal side, and we've also cut it through the different areas: IT, operations and some of our business costs.","So every one of those lenses provides I think an opportunity for us. We're not going to start to predict next year's cost. I think that we'll spend some time on in January as we report fourth quarter earnings. But I think, you can be assured that the direction of travel for our cost base have to be down, not up, and you've got a management team here that's committed to finding a way to do that. Exactly how much and in which areas and in which quarters, that's the kind of planning that we're assembling like as part of our budgeting right now and we'll be sort of come back with a good amount of specificity in January with our 2020 plans.","Ronald O\u2019Hanley","Ken, it's Ron. Let me just underscore Eric's last point there because of what we've done this year is reduced our expenses while continuing to invest in the business and create a value proposition to our clients that we think is superior to our competitors. But what we recognize that our returns aren't where they need to be. So what you should expect from us is more of the same and we'll come back to you with specifics.","Kenneth Usdin","Great. And one just quick follow up for Eric. Eric, did you say -- sorry, if I missed it, the premium am you would expect that to increase from second to third, can you just tell us where the two win from? And then now that we've re-based, is that at or kind of a flat level from here? Or do you expect an incremental as you go forward?","Eric Aboaf","Yes, Ken, it's Eric. The disproportionately high premium amortization that we saw in the second quarter has begun to burnout and we're pleased with the third quarter results. And so I don't think we expect anything out of source at this point. And that particular part of the portfolio has been -- has now performed much more closely in line with our expectations. I think the one thing we will see is continued effect of long rates, and that's just -- that that's from the overall portfolio and that's a little bit of what's driving the quarter-on-quarter guide on the NII, but nothing unique anymore as we had flagged earlier in the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Couple of questions, one on the deposit suites, could you just give us a sense as to how far along in the program you are and how much more running room there is as your clients execute on that?","Eric Aboaf","Sure. Betsy, it's Eric. So deposit suites are one of I'd call half a dozen different deposit initiatives that we're working on all around how do we both serve our clients as well as think about the appropriate kind of offerings, pricing and so forth. For background deposit suites came out as we looked at a large pool of a particular segment of clients. What we found was that we were sweeping down to 0, which ended up causing operational efficiencies and overdraft for clients in a way that wasn't particularly constructive for them. And in some ways, if you think about the retail world put both the client and also the company in a position which didn't make a lot of sense.","And so we've effectively done on that particular initiative. And like I said, it's one of half a dozen initiatives that we have out there. It's just sweep down to a minimum, call it, it could be $1 million level as an example. And anything below that, that's in our client account either at a low rate or look typically at a low rate sometimes at a noninterest-bearing rate. The benefit of that over the course of the last 3, 4 months, it's been on the order of just under $1 billion. So it's something that helps, and that's the -- those are the kind of packets we take. We're rolling that out into some of our European geographies now. So you can now see that scaling a bit. But I guess, I would frame it as one of a long list of initiatives to find the right way to accommodate clients, the right way to do business, the right way to create the services, but also to have appropriate value both for us and for our clients.","Betsy Graseck","So including all of the various programs, same kind of question, how long -- how far along do you think you're already thinking like 25% through, 50% through, 75% through just looking for the legs on them.","Eric Aboaf","It's a good way to ask the question. I think we're part of the way through because as we rollout deposit program 1, 2, 3 and 4, and kind of finish #1 and go to #2, we're beginning to think about what our deposit programs 5, 6 and 7 and then implementing those and then going to 8, 9, and 10. So I guess, we think that the challenge that comes upon us by lower rates and less liquidity in the system, the challenge for -- how do we continue to innovate and expand, what we can do and what you've seen us do here is part of this is around deposits, what can we do in terms of how we take cash and support clients with deposits on our balance sheet.","And then the broader set of engagement with clients, so how do you support them with all their liquidity needs. So think about the cash cascade, it's about what is the offering on deposits, what's your offering on repo and there is several different versions of repo and that's actually contributed to our NII.","What can we do on money market sweeps and actually sweep more of their funds to -- into some of the SSGA areas, and that's where we've actually been particularly successful this year or to other third-party funds if that they're choosing and earn a transaction fee as part of the process. So I think of it as the cash cascade and -- because we don't have as large of a loan book as the more traditional regional bank or universal bank, what we're doing is thinking about where do you innovate and expand on the liability side. And suites is one example. Repo is another example, and so on and so forth are ways that we do that. And we'll -- it's upon us to continue to innovate in those areas and find ways to serve our clients.","Betsy Graseck","And then just as rates come down, I mean, you do have clients that were expected, they are paying you through noninterest-bearing deposits. So as rates comes down, shouldn't the NII be start to grow?","Eric Aboaf","As rates come down, they may choose -- clients may choose to be more noninterest-bearing deposits. I think we don't always see that when rates come down slowly, I think we see that typically in a quick recessionary environment, where suddenly clients have a -- an immediate surplus of clash, they leave it in accounts. I think because the rate environment has been well telegraphed here, clients are disciplined and are going to continue to be disciplined and they're going to think how much we're leaving noninterest-bearing, and we think there will be at certain amount there. I think what we're hoping is that the rotation out of non-interest-bearing slows down and maybe even flattens as rates trend down whereas -- but we need to see -- we need to -- we need more quarters to observe the exact trends in that regard.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","If you can please come back to the big servicing win on the $1 trillion is, I guess, first of all is to clarify is that all one client or essentially all one client? I don't know if you can name the client. But more importantly, what did -- what were you doing for them, specifically? And I read, it was an accounting service mandate, such as may be clarify a little bit of what you are -- will be doing for them now? And any color on the time line of when you will move that, start doing that function?","Ronald O\u2019Hanley","Brian, it's Ron. We're not at liberty to name the client. Firstly that it's not all one client. So as I said earlier, there is a large mandate in there, but there was also a rich mix of both U.S. and non-U.S. clients, new and existing that came through in the quarter. This was a client that was an existing client and then had chosen to outsource accounting to us, and we will be implementing that sometime in the first quarter of 2020.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And they were doing custody with you, just custody or were they doing the office with you as well?","Ronald O\u2019Hanley","They were doing several other things with us.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And then maybe just on the portfolio reinvestment strategy, Eric. As obviously, we get more headwinds with potentially long rates moving down over time, just can you talk really quickly about the ability to either extend duration or move more into ABS from? It looks like you've been actually taking duration down a little bit over the last few quarters and as non-HQLA constraining that or do you think you have flexibility to improve the securities portfolio you'll use via the investment strategy?","Eric Aboaf","Brian, it's Eric. On the asset side, we really think about 2 drivers. We think about what we can do on the securities portfolio and we think about what we can do come on to the lending portfolio. And in fact, the first topic that we spent time on is how can we serve our clients on lending, and you've seen that grow at a -- I think at a better pace this year. It's capital call financing, it's 40 Act, leverage fund financing, it's lines of credit, and I think a nice mix activity. And in a way, it's extending our balance sheet, which clients -- the servicing clients value quite a bit. And it's actually partly a way to help drive some growth in NII and partly a way to solidify and actually drive some servicing fee growth. So that's the first part.","On the investment portfolio, our perspective is that as we maintain stability in the balance sheet, find ways to keep deposit stable or even grow them, there is a natural ability just to continue to invest gently in the market. And I say gently, because we don't think it's a great time to add a ton of duration, given rates. We want to keep a portfolio that's relatively CCAR-friendly. So that means, there's some duration in there, there is a well-diversified book of MBS. And then there is some -- in the international markets, there are some of the high quality sovereigns in some of the other multinationals as well. And so in general, I think we're going to try to build the investment portfolio in terms of size, but we will do it at that pace, and that should be able to create a little bit of a NII.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell","Eric, maybe just can you discuss a little bit how you're thinking the leverage ratio will evolve for you -- the trust banks? And if that's going to flip your constraining factor to CET1? Or do you think it still be the leverage ratio? And if it's the former, I guess, how do you think about what the right cushion is or right CET1 ratio with the -- inclusive of the SCB?","Eric Aboaf","Sure, Jim. The leverage ratio is right now are binding constraint as we operate the company more than any other factor. And we've been hardened by some of the ruling or some of the legislation in Congress that came out on the leverage ratio and then some of the proposed rule-making that was out for comment, and that the Fed put out there through the spring and summer. And so we're obviously waiting for final rules on exactly how they propose to implement the Congressional legislation. Once that occurs, and we've all seen the proposed rules, so that will create some room in our balance sheet. What that effectively does is move our binding constraints from leverage back into CET1 or capital. And as a result, that should free up an ability on our part to reassess what's in our capital stack, and in particular, the amount of preferreds that we have that form the basis for the Tier 1 capital. And so that will be the approach we take in the first stage of capital optimization.","I think once that occurs, your broader question on, what are the right CET1 target, the common equity Tier 1 target, it's something we have to navigate through, but we need to do it once we see the Fed's proposals on the stressed capital buffer and some of what the Fed has been describing is coming as part of CCAR later this year. And I think once we see that, then we, and in fact, other banks will have a better understanding for what kind of CET1 constraints we'll be under and what kind of targets we'll run -- we'll be able to run at. And I think once we see more of that, we'll be able to give you a little more of an indication of how we expect to operate.","James Mitchell","Okay. That's fair. And maybe just one follow-up question on the pricing efforts. How does that work? Is it more about convincing clients to give you more ancillary business to offset some of the lower demands -- the lower pricing demands? Or are you actually able to kind of work with some of the larger clients to keep the fee rate higher or convince them to -- how does that work, I guess, in practice?","Ronald O\u2019Hanley","Jim, it's Ron. It's a little bit all of the above plus more. It's a -- and that's been part of the management discipline we've imposed here is to ensure that the conversation is comprehensive and not just about what are we paying and should it be less or more. So some of it is consolidating business, some of it is broadening the set of services that we provide, including the discussion on, for example, global markets. This is all occurring against the backdrop where we have fundamentally improved our offering for the addition of Charles River. So some of it is around that in terms of putting in place a move towards the long-term outsourcing of activities to us. So it's a holistic conversation. There's some patterns, but in effect, they're never the same. But it's all about managing it to something much more broad than what is the rate that we're paying -- that the client is paying at any given time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities.","Michael Mayo","I guess I'm asking for a little preview of your update before the end of the year. So when you say you are reassessing the tech ecosystem, kind of what does that entail? And is it -- I think I saw online you're looking to get a new CIO, is that correct? And so I guess, the question is, why and why now? And then lastly, Charles River selected Microsoft for the cloud and why did you choose Microsoft? I thought the other parts of State Street are using somebody else for the cloud, so maybe it's a hybrid model. Or just a little bit of color on the cloud strategy, management changes and what you mean by reassessing the tech ecosystem?","Ronald O\u2019Hanley","Well, Mike, it's Ron. As you know, technology is fundamental to what we do and the technology requirements of our business continue to go up. So we're operating in an environment where we've spent a lot. We have to ensure that we're getting the greatest return on that spend, and we have to ensure that we're continuing to innovate throughout this cycle. So for -- what we've done to date is get very disciplined about what's important to servicing and innovating on behalf of our clients, but at the same time ensuring that we're getting a return on that. We're also focusing on making sure that we're operating at the highest levels of technology and operational resiliency.","What that requires is an intensive management of the process not just on a year-to-year, but on a month-to-month and week-to-week. Put in the vernacular, it's all about running the bank and changing the bank and doing that in an optimal way. So we are in the market for a new Chief Technology Officer. Our former technology -- we parted ways with our former Chief Technology Officer. That search is underway, and we'll have more to say about this later on in the year.","In terms of Microsoft and Microsoft as a cloud partner, as we've talked about, I think, repeatedly with you and others, we're building out a true platform in this front-to-back offering. So it's not just about saying we've got a new additional set of products and services, but it's an integrated platform underpinned by the data that we are uniquely positioned to provide and manage. And we want to make sure that we're building that platform carefully. So Microsoft is the cloud provider to us, but is also working with us to help make sure that the platform itself operates as we want it to, that it's as much cloud-enabled as possible. And this was a competitive bid. We talk to basically all the providers there, and our feeling was that Microsoft brought not just a cloud capability, but an ability to ensure that our platform is going to be better than any other.","Michael Mayo","And then, I guess, just separately, when do you look to convert State Street to Charles River, I think you had said you'd be your first client at some point?","Ronald O\u2019Hanley","Yes. You're talking about our SSGA, that our State Street Global Advisors and that conversion is underway right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Just speaking on Charles River, Ron, can you share with us the success, the conversion rates that you're having when you go into pitch new business to a customer with the Charles River offerings versus what those win rates were for the traditional State Street business? Are you having more success or is it more challenging?","Ronald O\u2019Hanley","Gerard, if you go back to Slide 8, and we report on this -- we're trying to report on this on every quarter. There's a broad-base set of discussions underway. Those discussions are frankly more than we expected, when we acquired the business a year ago, and they range from \"Gee, we do a lot with you already, State Street, and now we see this Charles River thing to be exact opposite.\" State Street, we do nearly nothing with you, but we're seeing this platform that you're building and recognize that it could help us improve our business, improve our operations and create better investment outcomes.","Those are -- these are discussions often times around the fundamental business model that these asset managers and asset owners have. So almost by definition, they're a -- they have a different cycle than a typical RFP-driven custody, this time it would be. What's encouraging about the discussions is that it's not just about Charles River, it's not just about let's bundle in Charles River to what we're doing with the client already in the back office, in the middle office. But it really is about how do we partner with you, State Street, and think about you as our outsourced partner or service provider and provide us a set of services that can help us create better investment outcomes. So they often time don't follow the usual prescripted RFP kind of time line, but we're highly encouraged by the fact that this pipeline that we've been showing you and again we're showing gross numbers here, but relatively few have fallen off somehow, but relatively few have fallen off and the discussions are continuing. We are in terms of where we are now, we're in exclusive negotiations at this point with several, which is more than we expected to be when we talked to you about the acquisition a year ago. So we remain very encouraged.","Gerard Cassidy","And continuing with this line of sight, is there any synergies with it? If you've brought some Charles River customers on to the State Street platform? Is it -- could it be higher margin business or no? It's just the costs are different, and you just don't see those synergies versus again somebody that doesn't use State Street at all and you bring them on board, you're not going to get the synergy right away?","Ronald O\u2019Hanley","Well, it's a mix of both, but I'll talk to you about some of the early wins here, which has been existing Charles River clients that are now using us for various global market activities. That business tends to be quite high margin by enabling a Charles River user to access some of our various e-channels in the global markets business. We're giving relatively user-friendly access at a very high margin to some good products of ours.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then just maybe, Eric, on the medium-term targets on Slide 16 in the presentation, can you frame out how you define medium term, is that 2 to 3 years or 5 to 7 years?","Eric Aboaf","Sure. Gerard, it's Eric. I think, if you look carefully at the foot notes, we were targeting end of 2021, so that really means end of 2021 in the sum of run-rate basis 2022. And I think the perspective we have is those are the right targets for us as a firm. Now we set them in the very beginning of December 2018 and a few things have shifted since then, right the markets took a turn down and then, at least rebounded that was bad and then good. Interest rates, completely different environment, if you think about where we were in the fall last year and the tenure with that whatever 2.75% as opposed to 1.75% now, but we've seen sub-1.50% and obviously economic activity out there, there's some real uncertainty, whether it's with the foreign trade or global growth. ","So I think, some real events have transpired, but if we think about our business and the kind of margins that we should be delivering, the kind of returns that we should have and the kind of capital provision back to investors that's where we're headed. And I think our -- the work we're doing is how and how do we find a way to get there and get there at a -- as fast a pace as possible. And I think related to one of the earlier questions on the call, part of our expense program this year, which they needs to translate to additional savings next year, it's going to be a way to do that, as well as rebuilding the growth engine, because that's equally important than just navigating the rate environment. So I think those we feel are appropriate and we're going to come back over time with how and how we're going to take important steps in that direction.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack from Autonomous Research.","Robert Wildhack","I wanted to ask about the ETF business with the e-brokers all going commission free. There's a view out there that this could be a big positive for the ETF space. Is that a view that you share? And if so, can you give us a sense for how you see that benefit playing out?","Ronald O\u2019Hanley","Yes, Rob, it's Ron. I think that anytime you're lowering your cost to the end user customer, I think it's good for the business. And in this case, we think it's particularly good for us because while we have a low-cost offering, we've not been honest many of the transaction -- transaction cost-free platforms as others. By kind of taking that out, it's enabling us to focus on where we truly are superior, which is liquidity. And if you think about this -- the various SPY offerings that we have, they're amongst the most liquid ETFs on the planet. In many cases, they constitute collectively a significant double digit of exchange volume. And as a consequence have some of the tightest spreads out there often. So we think that this is -- this enables us now to focus on where we are truly superior. So we look forward to this and I think it's a -- it will be beneficial to our ETF business.","Robert Wildhack","And then we've talked a lot about pricing in the moderation you're seeing there, but I'm wondering if you could clue us in on how the pricing improvement is progressing relative to your expectations when you undertook all of these initiatives earlier in the year?","Eric Aboaf","Rob, it's Eric. I think we went into this wave of pricing, which you remember was partly a catch-up as markets appreciate -- clients come back to us. But also realizing that some of our clients were under pressure, and we had to find ways to do right by them and become more efficient on our end to make it work. I think what I'd tell you is that we had patience that we could intervene and there were results that we could secure, but we weren't sure how much we could moderate pricing and at what pace to be honest, right? Because this was a bit of a new environment for us.","What I would tell you as I think we were pleased to see some of the moderation in second quarter of this year because we only really set up, for example, our executive pricing committee late last year. So that's 2 quarters in. We're pleased to see again, third quarter feel a bit better and then have some visibility into fourth quarter as well.","So I think we've been pleased with the pace, and I think it shows that if you put your mind to something and you take action and you put the right senior people and the right processes, you can have an effect. Now, pricing last year and this year will run as a headwind about 4% per year. If we can cut that back by a point and get it to 3%, I mean that's the first stage gate and that's what we're working hard to do. And I think our perspective is, we should continue to lean into our management practices and our approaches on pricing because they're having some of the desired effects, they're having them on a relatively good pace and it encourages us to continue to find ways to do more.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks.","Marlin Mosby","I wanted to ask a couple of things here. When we look at the $275 million in expense savings and we're saying we're going to get to $400 million by the end of the year. How does that kind of equates, it seems like that's a little bit of a pickup and then we're getting relatively flat expenses between third and fourth quarter. Is that just being offset the growth you're seeing in Charles River or the seasonality of their revenues and expenses that are tied to that. So just wanted to see what the thought was there?","Eric Aboaf","Sure, Marty, it's Eric. I think there are a couple of things at play. I think if you think about the quarterly pattern of the expenses last year and the quarterly pattern this year, we could begin kind of square that circle. I think on a year-to-date basis, ex-Charles River, we're down 2%. So we're certainly running at pace relative to where we were last year in the first 3 quarters of this year. So I think we feel pretty good about that. And I would tell you that expense savings come in waves. We've got very good visibility, 1 quarter out, and so we're quite pleased that we've been able to deliver the $275 million. And we see -- we have solid visibility and high confidence that we'll deliver the next $125 million and we'll put a bow around this and then begin our work on savings for next year as well.","Marlin Mosby","I mean that gives you $30 million of incremental run rate ex savings that you get more in the fourth quarter, which would be a helpful. And then when you think of the premium amortization on mortgage-backed securities and the impact on NII, your quarterly NII peaked out about $700 million towards the end of last year and we're forecasting $600 million as we're going into the fourth quarter of this year. So when you look at that $100 million shift, the very lowest that we got to is around $525 million when we had rates at close to 0. So much of the $100 million that we've lost over the last year in NII is related to the amortization of mortgage-backed securities and the premium there? And then kind of give us the accounting of what happens once long-term rates stabilize? And is there any of that $100 million that's potentially recaptured as those long-term rates begin to flatten out?","Eric Aboaf","Sure. Marty, it's Eric. The MBS premium amortization on the -- some of those Ginnie Mae pools that we had called out, that was worth on the order of $25 million, $30 million against the $600 million or $700 million that you described and that you have in our results. And for that particular pool from 3Q to third -- from 2Q to 3Q, we've actually been able to cut back on the amount of premium amortization, just as we've sold out of a couple of those positions and otherwise seen some burnout. So I think we're feeling good about how we've managed through that uptick, and now have seen that remediate.","I think the broader question you're asking is around what's the direction of rates that the Fed is putting us on, are they going to cut once more or twice or 3 or 4 times, are they going to go back to Fed funds down at 25 basis point range because if they do that, that certainly puts pressure on us and all banks as a way in a manner to drive down net interest income and net interest margin. I think we're just going to have to see. I think what I would encourage you to do is go back though, take a look at one year ago, two years ago, three years ago because I think our low point was further down. And I think our balance sheet is of higher quality now and in a better position to manage through some of what we might have in front of us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl from KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Just two quick questions. On the $20 million of the episodic market-related benefits as you saw in NII, could you just go into a little bit detail as to what that was and their line items that had impacted?","Eric Aboaf","Sure. Brian, it's Eric. So in NII, there are a couple kind of balance sheet type adjustments that we make at the end of the quarter, that tend to be a little lumpy, sometimes they're positive, sometimes a little negative, they tend to offset, but we had a couple of them that ended up in the positive territory this quarter. One of them was the marks that we take on our FX swap position. And when they trades cross quarter end and we do that just to make sure that we have stability given the volatility in some of those rates, we end up with a balance sheet mark that you take and then it unwinds effectively as the trade matures. So you get a kind of call it a September 30, December 31 that kind of impact, sometimes positive or negative and this time it was positive.","The other activity that we do like all other banks is we hedge our long-term debt. We have to test for ineffectiveness and the ineffectiveness testing is sometimes little positive, sometimes little negative, again that one was positive. So those were the 2 largest drivers. They collectively were about -- they came to about $20 million this quarter. And in the past, they've been bouncing around plus $5 million, plus $10 million, minus $5 million, minus $10 million and just kind of part of what we have to book to as part of our financial process.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then a separate question on securities finance. You mentioned that you have new optimization actions ongoing. Can you just give a little bit more detail as to what that is? What the potential revenue opportunity is there?","Eric Aboaf","Sure. Brian, it's Eric, again. Securities finance is one of those businesses that it has 2 features. I think on one hand, we had to make some adjustments to some of our counter-party positions in both FX and securities finance, this past year as part of some of our CCAR testing and some of our dialogues with the Fed. In the FX space, we're able to navigate through that because it tends to be a market with a large number of counter parties, you can do compression trades, you can do -- and you can diversify counter parties easily, et cetera. Sec finance is a little harder and I think that was one, where we felt more constrained over the last year, which is why our balance -- our lending balances are down and we've also had to constraint some of our activity, which has driven revenues down.","What we have begun to do though is innovate in securities finance and find ways to refine some of our trading activity, some of our structures. We've also been innovating in some areas around peer-to-peer matching, right that creates some more latitude for us. And as we've begun to take some of those actions, we feel like we've begun to free up space relative to the constraints that were effectively imposed upon us a year ago. And so now the team feels as they've -- they're more open for business and so now we're out there engaging with clients. And part of what we now need to see is client demand come back because as you know, there's a lot of money on the sidelines, there's a risk-off sentiment. And so as we see borrowing and lending happen in that space, which particularly is the domain of the hedge funds and other market participants once that rebound since so which is really a kind of an industry demand and client demand question. Once that rebounds, we feel like we are better prepared now to begin to grow our activity.","Operator","There are no further questions.

During the quarter, our results were affected by a constrained investment environment in seasonal expense factors. However, we continue to execute on our key priorities of growing our core business, controlling our expenses, investing in growth areas and optimizing our capital structure to deliver long-term shareholder value.","The environment during the first quarter was mixed. Global equity and fixed income markets were up slightly and investor risk taking behavior had a negative bias until the end of the quarter when investors began to move back into emerging markets. While volatility improved from the fourth quarter and helped our trading business, it remained constrained hitting a 7-year low during the quarter. Concerns about the Ukrainian growth in China similar throughout the quarter, but there were no significant impacts on the geopolitical front.","On the State Street front, we experienced seasonal expense increases in the first quarter as well as continued pressure on regulatory expenses. As a result of this tepid environment, we have taken action to further align our expense base by announcing this morning a reduction of 400 positions. We are committed to aggressively managing our costs and we will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to create efficiencies to position us to achieve our goal of creating positive operating leverage year-over-year.","The constrained environment and increasing regulatory requirements are also putting pressure on our clients. Consequently, we continue to see steady demand for our products and services around the globe. Our first quarter 2014 new asset servicing wins totaled approximately $189 billion representing a range of clients and sectors. 38% of those assets were from outside the U.S. Included in our new business wins are 25 new alternative servicing mandates, a client segment where we continue to see above average long-term growth potential.","New assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods totaled $136 billion. During the quarter, we saw outflows from money market funds into long-term funds. However, as the quarter progressed, the flows into long-term funds shifted from equities to fixed income out of emerging markets funds and into mature markets, which is indicative of continued cautious investor behavior. As mentioned, we did see some movement back into emerging market equity funds at the end of the quarter.","In our asset management business, we experienced net inflows of $4 billion for the first quarter driven primarily by strong inflows of $35 billion into cash collateral pools offset by $31 billion in outflows from ETFs and institutional mandates primarily passive equity. The net ETF flows of approximately $19 billion reflected typical seasonal activity in our S&P 500 fund. In this continued challenging environment, our objectives for 2014 are to drive growth in the core business, continue to mine efficiencies across the organization, including executing on our ops and IT transformation program, invest in growth areas and deliver positive operating leverage on an annual basis.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike who will discuss our actions more fully and review our financial performance.","Mike Bell - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Jay and good morning everyone. This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I would like to note that our GAAP basis results for the first quarter included a pre-tax severance expense of approximately $72 million related to staff reductions and realignment. As Jay noted, this action was taken to help mitigate environmental pressures and to align our expense base with our current revenue outlook. We continue to focus on one of our key priorities which is to support positive operating leverage on an annual basis in 2014.","On Page 11, I will begin the discussion of our operating basis highlights and I will reference our non-GAAP operating basis results in my comments unless I note otherwise. EPS for the first quarter of 2014 declined $0.99 per share from $1.15 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and increased from $0.96 a share in the first quarter of 2013. Our first quarter results in 2013 and 2014 included the seasonal effect of deferred incentive comp and payroll taxes. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, the increase in operating basis EPS was primarily driven by a reduction in average outstanding shares due to common stock repurchase program.","First quarter 2014 total revenue increased 1.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 and 3.6% compared to the first quarter of 2013. Total expenses increased in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the prior quarter primarily due to an incremental $157 million related to incentive comp and payroll taxes, of which $146 million is associated with the seasonal deferred incentive compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes.","During the first quarter of 2014, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately $420 million resulting in average fully diluted common shares outstanding of approximately $439 million for the quarter. In March 2014, our Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1.7 billion of our common stock through March 31, 2015.","Turning now to Slide 12, I will discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for the first quarter of 2014 focusing on the notable variances principally from the fourth quarter. First quarter 2014 servicing fees were up modestly compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to stronger global equity markets and net new business partially offset by lower transaction-related revenue.","First quarter 2014 management fees increased modestly from the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to net new business and stronger global equity markets partially offset by lower performance fees. Performance fees in the first quarter of 2014 were approximately $3 million, down from $5 million in the prior quarter. Additionally, first quarter 2014 management fees were impacted by money market fee waivers of $10 million compared to $13 million in the prior quarter.","Trading services revenue increased by almost 5% compared to the fourth quarter primarily due to higher foreign exchange trading revenue from higher volumes and volatility. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, trading services revenue was lower primarily due to lower foreign exchange trading revenue and lower distribution fees associated with the SPDR Gold ETF. Securities finance revenue increased from the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to higher spreads and volumes. Securities on loan averaged $333 billion in the first quarter of 2014 up approximately 6% from the fourth quarter of 2013.","Processing fees and other revenue increased approximately 20% from the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to an increase in revenue from joint ventures, tax-advantaged investments and certain portfolio transition services. Our net interest revenue decreased from the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to $19 million of interest revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 associated with the municipal security that previously been impaired and lower yields on interest earning assets.","I also reiterate the two net interest revenue scenarios that we reviewed at our February Investor Day. In our first scenario, we assume a modest improvement in market interest rates but not administer grades later in 2014. And we would expect full year NIR to be $25 million to $50 million lower than 2013 adjusted NIR of $2.289 billion. The second scenario assumes a static interest rate environment at 2013 year end levels for the remainder of 2014. And we would then expect our full year NIR to be $50 million to $100 million lower than the 2013 adjusted NIR of $2.289 billion.","Our operating basis net interest margin in the first quarter of 2014 was 124 basis points. And as a result of the persistent low interest rate environment we expect the net interest margin to continue to move forward into market interest rate rise. Average interest earning assets increased from the fourth quarter which was primarily driven by higher levels of client deposits.","And I\u2019ll now update you on how we\u2019re positioned relative to the liquidity coverage ratio or LCR. We expect to be above the 80% minimum requirement for the LCR as of January 1, 2015. This will likely result in a higher level of high quality liquid assets on the balance sheet which will have a negative impact on net interest revenue and this impact is reflected in our full year estimates.","Now let\u2019s turn to operating basis expenses on Slide 13. Our total expenses for the first quarter of 2014 increased approximately 9% sequentially primarily due to seasonal deferred compensation expense and payroll taxes and higher information systems and transaction processing expenses. Our first quarter 2014 compensation and employee benefits expenses increased from the fourth quarter 2013 primarily due to an incremental $157 million related to deferred incentive comp and payroll taxes of which $146 million is associated with seasonal deferred incentive comp expense for retirement and eligible employees and payroll taxes.","Compensation and employee benefits expenses continues to be impacted by costs associated with installing new business, investing in growth opportunities and implementing additional regulatory and compliance requirements. Our business operations and IT transformation program continues to be on track and for full year 2014 we expect to achieve approximately $130 million of additional pretax expense savings which would result in approximately $550 million of run rate savings since the inception of the program.","Information systems expenses increased from the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily reflecting the planned transition of certain functions to external service providers as well as higher maintenance costs associated with the new technology implemented that is part of the business ops and IT transformation program.","Transaction processing expenses increased from the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase primarily reflects higher volumes and higher equity values in the investment servicing business. Occupancy expenses of $114 million in the first quarter of 2014 decreased sequentially primarily due to the effect of a one-time $8 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2013 and a $4 million credit in the first quarter of 2014 each associated with a sublease renegotiation.","Other expenses decreased to $283 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to lower securities processing, sales promotion and professional services costs. I\u2019d also note that fourth quarter 2013 operating basis other expenses included $28 million of Lehman Brothers-related gains and recoveries which was essentially offset by higher securities processing costs.","Now I\u2019ll provide you some details on our March 31, 2014 balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 14, our overall approach managing our investment portfolio has not changed and we maintained a high credit quality profile. Our interest rate risk position was also in line with our position at year end. Additionally, the after tax unrealized mark to market gain as of March 31, was $124 million, which improved from the year end, due primarily due to narrower spreads in the first quarter.","And I will turn to the next slide to review your capital position. As you can see we maintained a strong capital position and that strength has allowed us to deliver on our key priority of returning value to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. As of March 31, 2014 our estimated pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 11.1% under the standardized approach and 13.2% under the advanced approach. Both capital ratios improved from the fourth quarter primarily due to an increase in Tier 1 common equity. This increase included a temporary 20% phase-in of the deduction of other intangible assets from Tier 1 common equity as allowed by the phase-in rules. Previously, our pro forma ratios included 100% deduction of intangibles which will be required by the Basel III rules once the reduction is fully phased in. Therefore, the improvement of approximately 100 basis points due to the phase-in will completely disappear by 2018.","On April 8, regulators released the 5% and 6% supplemental leverage ratio requirements for certain bank holding companies and insured depository institutions. At the same time, a notice of proposed rule making was issued to codify the calculation of the denominator of the SOR and in the NPR the ability to use a daily average of total assets is included which is positive for us. But unfortunately central bank placements were not excluded.","We estimate that our pro forma Basel III supplementary leverage ratio under our interpretation of the U.S. proposed rules issued on April 8 are approximately 6.4% at the holding company and approximately 6.0% at the bank as of March 31, 2014. The improvement in the leverage ratios is primarily due to the temporary capital benefit for the intangibles, the more favorable treatment of unfunded commitments, the use of the daily average of total assets and the issuance of preferred stock during the quarter. Partially offsetting these improvements was a larger average balance sheet driven primarily by the higher level of client deposits.","Now, we are pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan that we submitted in conjunction with the 2014 CCAR. In line with our capital plan, our Board approved the purchase of up to $1.7 billion of our common stock through March 31, 2015. Additionally, we will seek approval from our Board in May to increase the second quarter common stock dividend to $0.30 per share, up from $0.26 per common share that was declared in the first quarter.","Next I will reference Slide 16 where we detail a change in the presentation of our operating basis effective tax rate. Beginning with the first quarter of 2014 we changed the calculation of the operating basis effective tax rate by reflecting the tax equivalent adjustment that is included in operating basis revenue. This change has no impact on operating basis revenue, pretax earnings or EPS. We believe the change will better align our operating basis effective tax rate with our other operating basis metrics and will provide a more informative measure of the ordinary rate of tax generated by State Street business activity. On this basis, the operating basis, tax rate was 31.2% in the first quarter of 2014.","Before I conclude, I would like to address the question which maybe on investors and analyst\u2019s minds regarding our expense outlook for the remainder of 2014. Excluding the first quarter seasonal, deferred compensation expense for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes, we expect that expenses will increase in the last three quarters of 2014, primarily due to annual salary increases which are effective in April. We do expect to realize savings of approximately $22 million in 2014 from the staffing reductions announced today. I would note that we expect to achieve the majority of the $22 million of savings in the second half of the year and then expect $40 million of annualized benefit in 2015.","Overall, for the full year 2014, we continued to target 3% to 5% revenue growth and positive operating leverage. And while the environment continues to present challenges we plan to continue to focus on our top priorities, (driving) more revenue growth, investing in growth opportunities, controlling expenses, and managing our strong capital position. The expenses actions that we announced today reflect the current environment and put us in a better position to deliver on our goal to achieve positive operating leverage on an annual basis in 2014.","Now I am turning the call back to Jay.","Jay Hooley - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks Mike. Stephanie, Mike and I are now prepared to handle questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI Group.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group","First one is a quickie. I just want to make sure I heard your comments right, Mike, so full \u2013 on a fully phased in basis the capital ratios on the slide are about 100 basis points lower, still strong, but is that correct?","Mike Bell","That is correct Glenn. In terms of the Basel III risk weighted ratios in particular.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group","Yes, cool. And then just wanted to make sure that you are still according to the (annuals) that you had mentioned that you still have some more preferred to issue, I just want to make sure that that is still in the cards. And then an add-on question to that is how you balance the capital efficiency benefits with the earnings dilution and I am asking just because I see a lot of people short of their 1.5% bucket, but not issuing because you can\u2019t get back all the capital, what\u2019s the point.","Mike Bell","Sure. So Glenn, the overall answer is that our position on preps has not changed since the Investor Day. So as we talked about it at the Investor Day, we do expect to add at least $500 million over time for the preps to get to that 1.5% which we view as optimal in terms of the Basel III risk weighted capital ratios. Now really the key question when I say at least $500 million the key question is going to be the supplementary leverage ratio since the preps that we issue do count towards the SOR. There is an incentive. There is an economic incentive over time for us to potentially have issue additional preps which over the fullness of time we would expect to enable us to reduce the common equity that we have outstanding. And so in terms of your question on timing that is obviously something that we are looking at and we will continue to review our options. And again I would say that if we are really looking at this in terms of long-term shareholder value, it\u2019s a good trade to make the trade relative preps for common stock and the dilution is something that we think at this point is manageable, but it will be factored into decision going forward.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group","Right, last one is this is good thing the asset management fees were up more than the assets under management which I haven\u2019t seen in a long time, that\u2019s a good thing. In the tax it doesn\u2019t say that it\u2019s a performance fees, so is that just a function of mix and selling higher margin product?","Jay Hooley","Yes, I would say if you recall Glenn from our Investor Day we featured (indiscernible) presentation that we have \u2013 we are less concerned about pure AUM and more concerned about revenue per unit of AUM. And we have intentionally focused on higher yielding products mostly through ETF vehicles. And we continue to push those out and that had the effect of improving the revenue per AUM which we think is good and we think we will continue to focus on.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Hi, good morning.","Jay Hooley","Good morning Ken.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Mike, I just want to be super clear here. When you are talking about expenses moving up off of the first quarter base and you said excluding stock comp and payroll taxes, what\u2019s that explicit number that we should use to build off of?","Mike Bell","Thanks Ken. So what I would suggest \u2013 this is how I would suggest when you think about it Ken is I would take the first quarter comp and employee benefits number, I would back out the \u2013 let me just think about this for a second. I would back out the $146 million of 55 and 5, the retirement eligible comp that\u2019s embedded in there. And then I would think about adding approximately $21 million a quarter for the merit increases and importantly as you go from Q1 to Q2 we\u2019ll have an additional payroll day and that\u2019s worth about $5 million.","So that\u2019s how I would think about I mean there are obviously other pluses and minuses but I am trying to answer your question in terms of how to think about the baseline. I would make those adjustments as a starting point for Q2. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks while we will get savings in 2014 they will be from the expense actions. The reduction enforce of a net 400 FTEs we\u2019ll get benefit from that in 2014 that\u2019s mainly in the second half of the year and then we get an additional $18 million in the full year 2015 that we don\u2019t get in the full year 2014.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. Since I want to confirm but as you had said payroll taxes as well, so but the only thing we should really be backing out from the first quarter is just the $146 million?","Mike Bell","Yes. In the $146 million includes the seasonal effect of the payroll taxes on everybody. So what we look to focus on and with that $146 million number which is apples-to-apples with $118 million the year before is it\u2019s the deferred comp for everybody is retirement eligible and it\u2019s the seasonal bump up in payroll taxes that happens in Q1 as a result of flipping over the calendar year and FICA taxes and stuff starting back at zero base.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. And just because I am getting the question a bunch of times, the severance charges are not in that 10.85 number, correct?","Mike Bell","That is correct, Ken.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. And then operating expenses were higher than the range that you\u2019ve talked to in the past. Can you give us some color on what your outlook is for that operating expenses number, the other sorry other?","Mike Bell","Yes, sure. The other operating expenses Ken first of all continued to be very pressured by these regulatory compliance cost. So again very consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about at the Investor Day. And there is significant upward pressure on that number relative to 2013 levels. So in terms of the outlook for other operating expenses in 2014 it is going to be lumpy I mean it is going to be lumpy because of legal costs, it will be somewhat lumpy for regulatory compliance expenses so and actually lumpy as well because of securities processing costs.","So it is one of those \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult to give you a quarterly number with a lot of confidence because in any given quarter stuff can go bump and either be good or bad. I would characterize the first quarter though is being roughly in line with what we\u2019re going to see is on a quarterly basis over the course of the remainder of the year based on our current expectations. But I\u2019d say that the big wild cards are really the legal expenses and also the regulatory compliance cost where there is upward pressure.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. And then if I could just wrap a final one together. Your revenue growth was 3.6% and pretty much in that range you\u2019ve talked about. And obviously the expenses were in the 5s and even if you back out that retirement eligible the expenses were still growing 4.5%. So trying to understand then with a negative operating leverage start to the first quarter and the expenses still moving up from here albeit with your modest amount of incremental saves you are getting, what \u2013 what\u2019s your level of confidence that this can flip in the next three quarters and get us to a net positive operating leverage, when you think about revenues versus expenses. It seems like there is still an bad balance here between expense growth and revenue growth?","Mike Bell","Sure, Ken. A very important question that you are asking, so the overall answer is we\u2019re continuing to set as a goal for ourselves for the full year positive operating leverage for full year 2014 versus full year 2013. Now importantly as we\u2019ve talked about the Investor Day we are managing though for long-term shareholder value. And which means that we\u2019re going to continue to focus on the strategic plan that we\u2019ve talked about which is sure we want to be the low cost provider in the core activities but it also means that we\u2019re going to also focus on being an innovator of value-added services and which means we\u2019re going to continue to invest.","And so in terms of some of the numbers that you talked about I\u2019ll add some additional commentary there. First we do recognize that the Q1 revenue results was at the lower end of our 3% to 5% range that we reiterated at the Investor Day. And importantly Ken I would note that the \u2013 both the revenue and the expenses in Q1 was nominally higher because of the weaker U.S. dollar. So if you actually make it on a constant currency basis for 3.6 and the 5.8 that you referenced are likely 3 and 5. So the point is we recognized that we did not get a lot of help from the revenue environment in Q1.","Now we do think that there is some potential help that we could get for the full year revenue outlook. So for example we may get some potential help from equity markets. It was useful that equity markets now are higher than where they were at year end 2013 which was the basis of original 3% to 5% estimate. So that\u2019s useful. We also have not yet seen a material improvement in FX volatility but we would note that the FX volatility is still at a significant cyclical lows; we think there is some upside there.","We didn\u2019t see a little bit of help on sec lending spreads in Q1 and again we expect more help in Q2 since that\u2019s the seasonal dividend arm quarter where it\u2019s \u2013 where it is tended to peak so that should help. And then again if we could get some help from market interest rates in the second half of the year we think the revenue outlook could be better than call it 3% that we saw on a constant currency basis in Q1. But importantly Ken I would just reinforce, if the revenue outlook continues to be very soft we will continue to review our operating expense options I mean everything is on the table. We\u2019re \u2013 again we\u2019re managing this for the long-term but we\u2019re also very serious about our goal. So rest assured if we continue to see more 3% kind of scenario than 5% scenario we\u2019ll look harder at operating expenses.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. Thank you for all that color, Mike. I appreciate it.","Mike Bell","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Good morning guys. So just picking up on the last point I want to dig in into expenses, couple of specific items and maybe wanted on the revenues. So Mike I think when you mentioned is regulatory related costs are still going higher, that\u2019s something different than we heard from the other two trust banks. It sounds like the \u2013 they\u2019re still elevated obviously relative to where they have been kind of last couple of years but it didn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re growing a ton from here. Do you guys still expect that for State Street gets regulatory and legal related items will continue to grow in 2014 versus 2013?","Mike Bell","Absolutely, yes Alex. I \u2013 again I won\u2019t comment on any other company\u2019s issues. But I \u2013 it\u2019s virtually certain that ours will be higher and candidly it will be a challenge for us to manage the year-over-year increase in regulatory compliance cost to the $30 million to $40 million that we talked about at the Investor Day. There is real upward pressure on that $30 million to $40 million range.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thanks for that. And then on the revenue front the two items that I was hoping to spend a few minutes on our \u2013 the brokerage and other and then on securities lending. In brokerage and other I understand there is a couple of things that go in there. This line item has been kind of about 120, 130 range a year ago or so in the last couple of quarters has been closer to 100. So help us understand I guess what\u2019s been the biggest delta there? Is it really all the GLD or there has been some softness in the transition management business as well and then just a quick follow-up in sec lending?","Mike Bell","So on the brokerage and other revenue you\u2019re absolutely right, Alex. That category for us was down $30 million versus Q1 a year ago, a little over a third of that is the lower gold fees that we get were mainly reflecting the lower price of gold, but also outflows out of the gold fund. The other call it $19 million is really a combination of as you said lower transition management revenues but also importantly lower electronic exchange revenues. And again we feel like we are well positioned in that market. We see it really as a market phenomenon as opposed to a State Street specific situation. Again, if there is any silver lining to that dark cloud, it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s another area where we view as potential upside, if in fact global economic conditions improve.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Right and just ","Jay Hooley","","Securities lending piece\u2026","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Yes, I just wanted to get a sense on that\u2019s one of the bright spot I guess in the quarter pretty good growth year-over-year. And I think one of things you talked about at the Investor Day is enhanced custody and I think it was mentioned in your prepared remarks as well. So I was hoping you could either quantify I guess how much that new revenue stream has contributed if at all and maybe help us size the opportunity there?","Jay Hooley","Sure. It was a bit of bright spot both sequentially and year-over-year. First time in a while we have seen the online balances up nicely 6% sequentially and you did \u2013 you hit on the key element of the growth, which is in the quarter 25% of our securities lending revenues was driven by enhanced custody and almost all of the growth came through enhanced custody. So I will just remind everybody that\u2019s something that we began that\u2019s began investing three years ago and it\u2019s and we are still investing in it as we bring it into Europe and Asia. But we think it\u2019s a nice addition when we represent a lot of future of the securities lending business.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you so much for taking the questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","Good morning. I had a few clean up questions. First on revenues, can you just size your current asset servicing backlogs and also what is the CVA benefit to servicing fees this quarter?","Jay Hooley","Yes, its servicing backlog so committed not installed I believe the $136 million. And as for your other question I wasn\u2019t\u2026","Mike Bell","He is asking Jay about the CVA. The CVA was approximately plus $3 million in the quarter roughly flat sequentially.","Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, got it. And then just on expenses, I just want to add another basically complete the picture you painted, Mike. Of the $130 million savings, how much have you realized so far this year, could you give us some color there?","Mike Bell","Sure, Ashley I would characterize it as we have achieve the substantial majority of that $130 million and overall feel like the full year as well as the remaining $50 million in 2015 are on track at this point.","Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. And just finally on the occupancy expense line, should we think of $118 million as a starting point ex-credit this quarter?","Mike Bell","Yes, I would suggest that\u2019s a good idea.","Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brennan Hawkins with UBS.","Brennan Hawkins - UBS","So the asset management fee rate. If we adjust gross it up for the fee waivers and adjust for the performance and the day count. We would still down where it had been running the prior three quarters was there anything specific I know it was up year-over-year but versus where it had been in 2Q through 4Q, was there anything specific driving that drop?","Mike Bell","Well, so Brennan just to put some facts around it, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks the performance fees are down $2 million sequentially and I would also add that the day count cost us approximately $4 million. So again that would be the main headwind. We didn\u2019t get some help from little lower money market fee waivers as we saw money move out of the government funds and into prime money market, which leads to a little bit better waiver experience. And then some help from markets and also some help from a small amount of help from net new business.","Brennan Hawkins - UBS","Yes. I mean grossing up for all those, right I still had fee rate dropping from where it had been running, so I just \u2013 was there anything specific, was it just the flows out of SPY given that that\u2019s a higher fee rate and so it\u2019s a mix function what was it do you think?","Mike Bell","We did have some flows out of SPY so that\u2019s \u2013 and that tends to happen at Q1 that\u2019s a pretty common seasonality, seasonal pattern, excuse me.","Jay Hooley","","But nothing unusual in the quarter I think it\u2019s fair to look at the year-over-year, if you are not considering trends more in the sequential quarter.","Brennan Hawkins - UBS","Okay, thanks Jay. And then on those typical seasonal offers on SPY, is this quarter it\u2019s $19 billion, last year it was $5 billion, is there anything that\u2019s causing that to be so much worse, so much more pronounced than it was last year because we are not seeing anything any other big outflows out of other index products, so I am just kind of curious whether or not you have any insights into what\u2019s making that, maybe a bit more seasonally severe this year?","Jay Hooley","I think it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think there is anything unusual there and in fact after the quarter ended we saw a lot of that come back. So I think it is used as trading account at quarter end. And I think if we look back over several years you would see there is a fair amount of difference in those flows, but we are not reading anything other than, anything trend wise into it.","Brennan Hawkins - UBS","Perfect and helpful to hear that it bounced back here first quarter. And then last one from me, just really a minor one the CVA I think you guys highlighted the counterpart evaluation adjustment in the processing fee, can you maybe size that for us?","Mike Bell","It was approximately $3 million positive Brennan.","Brennan Hawkins - UBS","Terrific and that\u2019s versus sequential or year-over-year?","Mike Bell","Sequentially it\u2019s flat, it was also positive in Q4. Q1 doing some my memory I believe was minus $6 million. So it would be a $9 million improvement on comparing those two quarters.","Brennan Hawkins - UBS","Terrific. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein","I guess I am still confused by the slide on the asset servicing fees as a percentage of assets under custody, I think your asset value at the Investor Day, I get the context that less than 50% of the fees are directly linked to AUC, but I think you stopped sort of really providing a detailed explanation of the dynamics that will play there. So maybe you could do that for us now I mean I think we are seeing better flows at the asset managers portfolio turnovers finally picking up, so why is this still falling. What types of activity is specifically under pressure and all those cyclical \u2013 cycle of pressures?","Mike Bell","Sure, Luke, it\u2019s Mike, the transaction revenue is the main piece that I would ask you to factor into your analysis. So specifically transaction revenue was down $5 million sequentially Q4 versus Q1. And it\u2019s just lower market activity. I mean believe me when I tell you, we have looked at it several different ways and it just looks like it is driven by lower market activity going on. And so I would expect when we get into an environment where the global economies were healthier and there is a little more risk taking. We would expect that to improve, but I would certainly acknowledge that we have seen it move in the opposite direction now for three sequential quarters and just in time for me taking the job of course.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, slightly more detailed question, maybe you could just touch on processing fees and other revenues. I think there was some noise in this quarter, but I think the last time you said anything in terms of guidance was first quarter 2012 and you pointed to $70 million to $75 million as a decent run rate, but then later you\u2019ve stated that line by about $35 million. So would you be willing to say that $100 to $210 million is a decent run rate for that line?","Mike Bell","Luke what I would suggest is if you include the tax equivalent adjustment that we detail every quarter which the recent increase there has been primarily caused by the higher volume of tax-advantaged investments. If you include that tax equivalent adjustment, I would expect that the processing fees and others would range between $125 million and $135 million a quarter for the remainder of this year, again importantly including the tax equivalent adjustment.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then final one from me. Just high level, given that the scale asset managers have been earning sub-par for the last five years, I would imagine that smaller services are maybe even earning worse returns, so why haven\u2019t we seen more competitors accept the business will merge and maybe you can discuss the dynamics that caused I think so many to hang on this business and then what did that say about the benefit of having scale on the business?","Jay Hooley ","Luke, is your question pointed at asset managers or asset servicers?","Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein","I am sorry to say asset mangers, I mean asset servicers.","Jay Hooley ","Okay, it is a huge advantage of scale and I think they are getting even greater when you think about the position of regulatory and compliance cost that we referenced earlier. I think that the question of why you have done more consolidation on the back of that. First off there has been a lot of consolidation, so if you look at the concentration in the asset servicing business there are four firms that have 70% of the market by the industry calculations. You\u2019ve got a series of banks, European banks I think continue review this business even though sub scale is attractive and some parts because the liquidity is that provide an environment where those banks are under some pressure. So I think that move on its closure some point in the future but I don\u2019t see exchanging and short term. And other category of service providers I would point to if you look at the alternatives.","As in servicing space its get a little bit more for us volume of sub scale players remains that many of you wouldn\u2019t know it and that\u2019s been I think that\u2019s a market that proportionally has higher growth prospects and has experienced higher growth. So, I think that\u2019s caused people to hang in there. So, in summary I would say there is, because of the concentration and consolidation that occurred up until now there is less prospects who are lapsed. And for different reasons people are finding it so interesting being in the game. I think that the need to drive efficiency out the core operations need to address components and regulatory costs will continue. And I think that puts pressure on sub scale providers.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.","Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets","Hi, guys, this is actually Steven Dong in for Gerard. Thanks for taking a call. Just going back to SOR you guys had provided some color on the improvements sequentially. Would you happen to have the break out of the percentage basis of the moving parts for that?","Mike Bell","Steven, it\u2019s Mike. So what was focus on the bank which went from 5% to 6%.","Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets","Yes.","Mike Bell","And so specifically and going to give you round numbers here. The improvement that we got from the temporary credit on the intangibles is worth approximately half of that so call if 50 basis points. The combination of the moving to the daily average calculation rather than the month end calculation roughly offset the larger balance sheet we have in the quarter because of the spike up in the excess deposits. You can size that plus and minus that about 30 basis points but those \u2013 those two things of offset. And then the benefit that we got from the improve conversion factors under the rules, is worth approximately 30 basis points. And then we had a bunch of other odds and ends that contributed 20 basis points. So that would be the go forward at the banks from 5 to 6.","Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets","Great, thank you. And we do have the holding company level at all?","Mike Bell","Sure. It\u2019s approximately the same numbers, the only other piece that you are going to factor in to that analysis is that the proceeds that we have from the pref issuance. So the call it 750 million of proceeds from the pref issuance is worth call it another 25 to 35 basis points that\u2019s it quarter level and not at the bank level.","Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets","Right. When you issue your $500,000 million in plus you would expect perhaps another say 15 basis points then?","Mike Bell","That\u2019s correct, call it 20 yes.","Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, perfect. And just going back to your new business wins, do you have the break out what was the outside of the U.S. versus U.S.?","Jay Hooley","Yes. I think it was roughly 38% outside the US, which is consistent with downs we have seen over the last couple of quarters.","Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets","Great, that\u2019s all for us. Thanks for taking the call.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning.","Jay Hooley","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","A couple of questions one on expenses and one on revenues, so on the expense side I noticed you have the merit increase coming this year and I don\u2019t know if this right calculation we just look at relative to total comp dollars looks like around 2% hike and wondering how you think about sizing it. This feels a little bit higher than inflation right now. Looks like its not necessarily tight performance is that there is wondering how you size that number?","Mike Bell","Yes, Betsy, it\u2019s Mike. First of all, we did average a 3% increase in base salaries that\u2019s effective in April. And basically, we did a review of the market conditions. We reviewed what other companies were doing, where our compensation levels were versus other key competitors and key competitors, not just banks, but also just other people that we battle with for talent. And yes, I would certainly acknowledge that the 3% is a fair amount higher than the last couple of years where we had very small increases. And but \u2013 again, we thought it was important given the competitive landscape and the importance of keeping our top talent.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","So if we see a little wage pressure here maybe we will get interest rates rising on the front of the curve, so again that would be nice?","Mike Bell","That will be very helpful, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Exactly. So then just the second thing is on collateral transformation, I just wonder at the Analyst Day, Investor Day, you have highlighted some of the things you are doing to try to increase your share of activity along the trading channels right doing more in TV related stuff doing more with collateral management and collateral transformation. Could you give us a sense of where you are in that process? And is this anything that we are going to see in the numbers, in the next year or this is more of a very gradual over time five years down the road we will look back and say, hey, this was a story something to act?","Jay Hooley","Betsy, this is Jay. Let me take that. I would say it\u2019s the latter. It will gradually bleed in over time. I think collateral transformation is a product that we offer today, where ramping up slowly that activity across the number of customers, derivative clearing probably a little bit more excitement going on. We are on the front end of timing of customers. There is a little bit of a lead time to sign them up. Once you sign them up, you should see a pretty steady flow. I think we are viewed as an attractive alternative on the derivatives clearing space. And then Enhanced Custody would be another product that I would say is maybe indicative of what I would expect that of derivatives clearing, collateral management a couple of years out. It took us a year or so to get it set get the infrastructure set, revenues started coming in, but once they start coming in, they should be pretty sustainable and improving over time. So it\u2019s the gradual enhancement to core revenues.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks a lot. Just a quick question on the assets under custody and administration levels, it looks like just looking at your Page 3 of the main release that it went up 0.2%, but the markets in most cases, I guess other than EEFA went up more than that and you guys do sight net new business. I am wondering just in terms of levels why wouldn\u2019t it go up a little bit more given your equity sensitivity?","Jay Hooley","Yes, let me take that one, Cynthia, because there is a \u2013 we did lose a customer that had low revenues and high AUA and let me just explain the situation, because it\u2019s unusual with the customer that we acquired through IBT back in \u201806 it\u2019s rare that we would do middle office without custody activities. In this case, we were doing middle office without custody activities and it had a pretty high AUA and pretty low revenues. It was a pretty simple middle office construct. And in talking to the customer over the last couple of quarters, they concluded we agreed that they would internalize it and so that really speaks to that abnormality, which I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I would say was clearly one-off.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","So can you give a sense of the size of that and I guess there is very little revenue impact you are saying?","Jay Hooley","Yes, $500 billion which is where you get the anomaly and pretty low revenue. Again, just a simple middle office only implementation, nowhere close to our, all of our other middle office implementations, but that\u2019s distortion.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. And in terms of the new asset servicing mandates you are bringing in, how does the mix compare to what you have in place in previous quarters? Any shift, is it similar?","Jay Hooley","Yes, it\u2019s similar, but it\u2019s heavily weighted in the alternative space, again more hedge and private equity. You also see \u2013 we all see those alternative structures moving down in market and to some of the liquid structures. So I would say we should continue to expect to see proportionately more of our new business growth coming in those alternative categories.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then finally the $40 million cost saves you guys have cited and the headcount cut, maybe you said this. But where are those cuts and are there any offsets like for instance the increase in IT as you move to external service providers. Is that related to headcount cuts?","Jay Hooley","No, I would say Cynthia that the headcount cuts were kind of broad-based, no specific theme, but as we continue to mine the organization for efficiencies or things that we can do in other places we took advantage of that.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And are there any offsets in terms of greater use of outside services?","Jay Hooley","No, it\u2019s a straight reduction.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you.","Jay Hooley","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Wharton with JPMorgan.","Steven Wharton - JPMorgan","Hi guys.","Jay Hooley","Good morning.","Steven Wharton - JPMorgan","I just wanted to I think this question may have been asked but forgive me if it was. What was \u2013 what\u2019s the business the whole outsourcing and IT initiative cost sales objective for 2014 incrementally and what has been achieved cumulatively to-date of the total that you\u2019re trying to achieve through the end of 2015?","Mike Bell","Sure. So Steven its Mike. The goal for 2014 full year is $130 million and that would bring the cumulative to-date to $550 million at the end of this year and there would be a remaining approximately $50 million that we would get in 2015, so $600 in total.","Steven Wharton - JPMorgan","Right. And were you saying that through the first quarter you\u2019ve already achieved the $130 million I was..","Mike Bell","I would characterize it is not the full amount but a majority of the amounts. If you then annualize the Q1 we would have achieved the majority of the annual amount.","Steven Wharton - JPMorgan","Okay. So basically that\u2019s why on degree you\u2019ve announced this additional restructuring of sort because you basically run out of benefits from the outsourcing initiative for this year and then there has been maybe a little bit more in 2015?","Mike Bell","Yes, I mean again we did for a variety of reasons including the software revenue picture. And the importance of our goal of achieving overall positive operating leverage for the full year.","Steven Wharton - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","Hi Mike, hi Jay. I want to reconcile one comment you mentioned the transaction related fees were down $5 million or transaction related revenues were down $5 million linked quarter. But then when I look at your commentary in the release on transaction processing expenses, you say that those were up due to higher volumes. So how do I reconcile those two statements?","Mike Bell","Sure. Vivek its Mike. They are even though they\u2019re both, they had the word transaction and then they are very different items. So specifically as I mentioned earlier the brokerage and other revenue is driven by the combination of the lower gold fees with SPDR GLD fees as well as the pressure that we\u2019ve seen on the electronic exchange revenue that\u2019s picked up in other trading services. The transaction processing fees those are mainly service bureau fees and they are higher based on our higher volumes that, those kinds of volumes would tend to track more with our global service fee revenue as opposed to any of the other line items. So.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","But the gold and other is showing up in processing and other fee, right?","Mike Bell","Well the gold fee is driven by the volume of (indiscernible) that we. Sorry go ahead.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","Yes, the gold and other and the brokerage fees whereas I am referring to your asset servicing fees we\u2019ve talked about transaction related activity being down. And I am reconciling, trying to reconcile that with transaction volumes being up in the transaction processing expenses line?","Mike Bell","I am sorry, I misunderstood your question Vivek. So again the transaction fees that we get as part of the GS revenue is down just because of lower market activity. Things like the service bureau fees that can include things like pricing, services, transfer agent cost. Again, there are different volume drivers from the expense versus the transaction revenue.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","Okay, alright. Let me reask one other question asked earlier. The processing and other fees which went up from 106 to 127 which you said the run rate will be 125 to 135. When I look at the (tax less) quarter adjustment that went from 53 to 57, so a lot bigger increase in the processing and other fees, what\u2019s driving that and how sustainable is that?","Mike Bell","Sure. Again, I would suggest you look at in total because part of the processing and other fees. If you exclude the tax equivalent adjustment is actually the amortization that we have on the tax advantaged investments themselves. So that piece contributed three of number that you are describing. So I think of the tax advantaged investments as being up 7 sequentially which is poor from the tax equivalent adjustment and 3 from the lower amortization. In terms of the rest beyond the 7 of JV revenue was up sequentially 8 million Q4 versus Q1 of 2014.","Again that tends to bounce around but I think the Q1 is pretty down close to what would expect further remainder of the year in term of JV fees but again with the caveat but it does bounce around. We also head on uptick in portfolio a transition services specifically some currency risk management fees that we saw in increase and again I would characterize the Q1 has being in reasonable expectation for the remainder of the year. In aggregate the back I would say that the processing fees and other including the tax equivalent adjustment or reasonable expectation would be 125 to 135 over the remainder of the year, with the, slight growth that we\u2019ll see there are mainly driven by higher tax advance investments for Q2 and Q3 in particular.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Hi, good morning. Just want to follow up on your NII outlook in the balance sheet you had a bigger spike in deposits in the balance sheet when you peers I guess number one can you may be if you have any insides on what drove the spike. And then secondly embedded in your NII outlook what is your view \u2013 what\u2019s the embedded view of your balance sheet for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Mike Bell","Sure, Jim its Mike. I\u2019ll start the first we didn\u2019t see on increase in excess deposits in Q1 versus Q4 we estimate that they will up approximately 3 billion in terms of the average daily balances Q1 versus Q4. They spike significant at the very end of the quarter and view it as really a function of the fact that we viewed as a safe heaven and also that there are not other great alternatives for our clients to put very short-term money at this point in time.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Europe for the US or so.","Mike Bell","It\u2019s actually both.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay.","Mike Bell","Both so I again if you look at any particular plan there is a different story for each client but that in this \u2013 it is global\u2014phenomenon at this point. In terms of what we think size in the balance sheet would be the over the course of the year, the short answer is, if we expect, if the short-term interest rates do rise, we do expect of the majority of our excess deposits that are on the balance sheet would likely viewed and find other places where they get earn better yields. And that is embedded in our forecast that will gave under that scenario remember.","Jim, I would ask you to remember that this is very low margin, this is because basically we take these client deposit fees, these excess deposits from our clients and put them with the big central bank. So again with earning for our numbers call it 20 basis point name on that \u2013 on those assets. So it\u2019s not a big move in terms of our net interest revenue over the course of the year. Excluding the impact of the excess deposits I would expect that we would have essentially stable to perhaps modest growth in the core operational deposits over the course of the Europe. The big mover in terms of the overall size of the balance sheet will be the \u2013 will likely be the excess deposits.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee - KBW","Thanks for taking my question. And yes, I apologize upfront for this, but it\u2019s \u2013 I want to go back to asset servicing and trying to get wrap my head around the idea of the lower activity, because when you look at a lot of things out in the marketplace, whether it\u2019s fund flows, whether it\u2019s move to alternatives, whether it\u2019s even, I guess I would characterize even higher sec lending balances as being some indication of leverage and risk taking? And then kind of also layer on top of it, but may be you are being impacted in asset servicing by lower customer activity? Couple of things, how much of that maybe is being impacted by pension movements for the LDI, was that having like negative impact on that business that\u2019s discernible and should we be thinking that maybe that business, maybe say to a point you made on emerging markets of actually maybe it\u2019s more leveraged to two emerging market flows and things like that, that maybe we would proceed from the outside? We are just trying to be a little more granular on it.","Mike Bell","Well, Robert, let me start with a couple of facts and then I will ask Jay if he wants to add. So in terms of the transactional revenue that\u2019s embedded in our global service fees, those were down as I said earlier, down $5 million sequentially and down $3 million versus Q1 of 2013. We have sliced in and diced it. And it just truly looks like simply lower market activity and unfortunately has been a continued trend that we have seen now for three straight quarters. I think there is potential for that to improve when we see a little bit more global market activity, but again, those are the facts. Let me see if Jay wants to add?","Jay Hooley","I don\u2019t know what I could add other than just it does reflect the portfolio managers who are part of the customer base that we serviced there, velocity of trading. And as you know, we proportionately we are greater in the funds business, in the alternatives business, less proportionately in pensions and corporates. So, it\u2019s \u2013 I can\u2019t put my finger on anything other just lack of trading volume. I think to me the service fees in addition to the actual trading activity being affected as much by kind of muted market activity, pretty slow growth on the equity and the fixed income front and lack of risky investments as much a drag on that service fee line as the transaction volume itself.","Robert Lee - KBW","I appreciate taking my question. Thank you.","Jay Hooley","Stephanie, is that it?","Operator","Yes, that\u2019s your final question sir.","Jay Hooley - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","So thanks everybody. We look forward to getting on the phone with you again at the end of the second quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions]","Now, I would like to introduce Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations of State Street.","Valerie C. Haertel","Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings materials include a presentation that Jay Hooley, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Resch, our Chief Financial Officer, will refer to in their remarks. Reconciliations of non-GAAP or operating basis measures to GAAP measures referenced on this webcast as well as other materials can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Before Jay and Ed begin their discussion of our results, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements and as a result to various important factors, including those discussions in State Street's 2011 annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC. We encourage you to review those filings, including the section on risk factors concerning any forward-looking statements we make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, January 18, 2013. The corporation does not intend to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Jay Hooley.","Joseph L. Hooley","Thanks, Valerie, and good morning, everyone. As Valerie noted, our remarks will follow the financial highlights slide presentation that we issued with our earnings press release this morning. In this morning, Ed and I will focus our remarks on the fourth quarter and make select comments regarding our full year 2012 financial results, then we'll share some initial observations about our expectations for 2013.","While 2012 was another challenging year for the financial services industry due to the global economic backdrop and increased regulatory requirements, we remain committed to our strategic and operational priorities. In the fourth quarter, we delivered on those priorities, driving new revenue growth while leveraging the scale of our core business and returning capital to shareholders. And as we begin 2013, I'm confident that we'll continue to deliver on these priorities this year.","I'm going to make a few comments on our performance which you can follow on the slide deck, and I'll begin on Page 3. On an operating basis, fourth quarter 2012 earnings per share increased 12% to $1.11 from the third quarter and 19% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Revenue growth coupled with prudent expense control including the savings realized from our business operations and IT transformation program, produced positive operating leverage on a sequential quarter, year-ago quarter and full-year basis. This morning, we announced additional actions we are taking to lower our expenses going into 2013 to align with our business outlook for the year. We announced the reduction of approximately 630 positions or about 2% of our workforce. While decisions regarding our people are among the most difficult we make, we fully recognize the need to adjust our workforce and locations around the globe in response to a challenging and changing revenue environment. These reductions underscore our continuing efforts to create a linear, more efficient and more profitable enterprise.","Now, I'd like to make a few comments regarding the business environment, equity markets and client activity. The global equity markets rose during the fourth quarter with the EAFE daily average increasing 5.2% and the S&P 500 daily average increasing 1.2%. Those as opposed to the third quarter. While the economic situation in Europe appears to be stabilizing, concerns around the U.S. fiscal cliff kept many investors on the sidelines in the fourth quarter. But during the quarter, equity markets improved but clients remain conservative until the back end of the fourth quarter when we saw a noticeable re-risking by some of our clients as they shifted allocations for more conservative fixed income investments to domestic and global equities.","As we begin 2013, client re-risking has continued, as you see from recent data, market data about equity flows. In spite of what feels like a positive start to the year in client risk appetite, we remain conservative in our expectations for the market and cautious regarding investors' willingness to take on additional risk.","If I turn to our revenue and new business results in the fourth quarter, we continue to generate solid core fee revenue and experienced momentum from significant business wins. Total operating basis revenue increased 3% to $2.46 billion from the third quarter of 2012 and 7% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Our fourth quarter results include the acquired Goldman Sachs Administration Services business that we closed on October 2012. Importantly, we experienced some early cross-sell success as we introduced our new clients to an expanded range of State Street services. Core fee revenue comprised of asset servicing and asset management fees increased 4% from the third quarter to $1.4 billion. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strong demand for our products and solutions across our global client base. The fourth quarter was the strongest quarter of the year for new business and asset servicing. New asset servicing mandates was $649 billion, split roughly 86% from the U.S. and 14% from outside the U.S.  And of that $649 billion, $143 billion was installed prior to December 31, 2012 and $506 billion is expected to be installed in 2013. Also included in our new assets to be serviced are 92 new alternative asset servicing mandates.","If I turn to our asset management business, State Street Global Advisors had a strong quarter and year due to improved global equity markets, strong long-term flows into higher-yielding strategies and disciplined expense controls. Net new assets to be managed totaled $24 billion for the quarter and that excludes net outflows in short-term cash collateral related to securities lending. Of the $24 billion, $13 billion went into ETFs with the remainder flowing into the institutional channel including passive equity strategies and fixed income, as well as some money market assets.","With any ETF product line, asset classes gaining new inflows with the SPDR S&P 500 fund, the gold fund and the high-yield fixed income fund. Of note is that year-to-date, ETF assets under management is at a record level of $340 billion, reflecting a 24% increase year-over-year. In both asset servicing and asset management, our pipelines continue to be strong and well-diversified.","If I move you to Slide 4, market-driven revenue remains under pressure from subdued capital market activity, low levels of volatility and low interest rates. In trading services, foreign exchange trading revenue for the fourth quarter increased compared to the third quarter due to higher direct FX volumes, while volatility continues to be challenging. Securities finance revenue declined in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter as a result of spread compression between the fed funds to 3-month LIBOR rate, as well as lower volume. Our net interest margin on an operating basis declined to 136 basis points from the third quarter due to persistent low interest rate environments and the continued high levels of excess deposits.","Now, if I turn to expenses. We continue to demonstrate good control over our expenses while continuing to invest selectively in the business to fuel future growth. While fourth quarter operating basis expenses increased 3%, we achieved positive operating leverage. We're pleased with the expense reductions related -- generated to date through our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. And in the fourth quarter, we were able to accelerate some expense savings from the program, achieving $112 million in incremental pretax savings in 2012 and $198 million accumulative expense savings through the end of 2012. Our transformation program remains on track to deliver the expected savings in 2013 and through the end of 2014.","I'm also pleased that we achieved a comp to revenue ratio of 39.4% for the full year, reflecting our emphasis on strong expense control.","Let me now move you to Slide 5. Our financial strength and disciplined approach to capital management have enabled us to maintain consistently strong capital ratios under Basel I and the proposed Basel III standards based on our understanding of the proposed rules. In early January, we submitted our 2013 CCAR plan to the Federal Reserve, which included a capital distribution program of dividends and share purchases that we believe is consistent with our strong capital positions and earnings capacity. The amount in form of our capital distribution is contingent upon the Federal Reserve not objecting to our request, and we expect to receive the results of their review in mid to late March. Distributing capital to our shareholders through common stock purchase and dividend programs remains a top priority as we continue to be very cautious in our approach to acquisitions.","In the fourth quarter, we purchased approximately 11 million shares of our common stock for $480 million and we declared a $0.24 per share common dividend. And as of December 31, there was approximately $360 million remaining available for purchase through March 31, 2013 under our $1.8 billion authorization.","So in summary, we're focused on growing revenue, carefully controlling expenses and creating value for our clients and shareholders.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed to take you through the financials in a little more detail. Ed?","Edward J. Resch","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comments on Slide 8 of the earnings presentation which shows a summary of operating basis fourth quarter results. My comments this morning will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings news release. GAAP results are presented earlier in the presentation and in the release.","Revenue increased 3.2% from the third quarter to $2.5 billion and 7% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings per share demonstrated solid growth, up 12% from $0.99 in the third quarter and up 19% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Additionally, we generated positive operating leverage on a sequential quarter, year-ago quarter and full-year basis.","Return on equity of 10.3% increased from 9.6% in the third quarter of 2012. We purchased 480 million of common stock during the fourth quarter at an average price of $43.99 per share, resulting in approximately 468 million average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter, a reduction of 12.5 million average shares in the sequential quarter comparison.","Slide 9 shows a summary of our full year results. Revenue for full year 2012 increased 1.7%, primarily from net interest revenue, servicing and asset management fees offset by lower trading revenues. Our core asset servicing and asset management fees performed well in 2012 in a difficult economic environment with servicing fees up 1% and management fees up 8% from 2011. Both increases are due to improved equity markets as well as new business, partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar. 2012 market-driven revenues included an approximate 10% increase in net interest revenue to $2.4 billion due primarily to higher interest earning assets partially offset by lower asset yields. Our net interest margin for the year averaged 146 basis points compared to 152 basis points.","The year-over-year decline in our net interest margin was, in large part, driven by the $16 billion of average excess deposits in 2012, which was higher than we had originally projected at the beginning of last year and higher than the $10 billion we averaged in 2011. 2012 trading services revenue declined 17% from 2011 due to continued weakness in foreign exchange revenues. Foreign exchange revenues for the year decreased 25% due to low volatility, partially offset by higher volumes.","Expenses were well controlled in 2012, increasing 1.7% from 2011, slightly less than revenue growth resulting in 3 basis points of positive operating leverage. Incremental expense primarily reflects new business and regulatory requirements. Earnings per share increased 5.9% to $3.95 for 2012 and our ROE was 9.7%, slightly lower than 2011. For full year 2012, the company purchased approximately 33 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1.4 billion.","Now, let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss fourth quarter revenue drivers. As you can see, we continue to demonstrate strength in our core business. Servicing fees increased 4.5% to $1.2 billion on a sequential quarter basis due to $24 million in revenue contributions from the acquired Goldman Sachs Administration Services business, net new business and stronger global equity markets. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, servicing fees increased 8.8% due to the impact of a stronger global equity market, net new business and acquisitions. Investment management fees and SSgA were up 3.6% from the third quarter due to higher performance fees and stronger global equity markets. Compared to the year-ago quarter, investment management fees were up almost 29% driven by stronger equity markets, net new business and higher performance fees. Performance fees in the fourth quarter were $8.2 million, up $4.3 million and $6.1 million from the third quarter and the year ago quarter, respectively. Money market fee waivers were approximately $5 million in the fourth quarter, flat compared to the third quarter, and down 60% versus the prior period. Total trading services revenue, compared to the third quarter of 2012, increased 4.7% driven by higher brokerage and other revenue, including transition management and foreign exchange revenue. Foreign exchange revenue increased 2.6% from the third quarter due primarily to a higher direct foreign exchange trading offset by lower volatility and a decline in indirect foreign exchange from the third quarter of 2012.","Our volumes in electronic foreign exchange trading increased in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis. The increase in average daily volumes across all of our electronic FX platforms during the fourth quarter was about 5%. In comparison to the same period, the primary interbank foreign exchange platform vendors electronic broking system and Thomson Reuters reported an 8% and 12% decline, respectively in the average foreign-exchange daily volumes traded across their platforms. Foreign exchange revenue decreased 21% when compared to the fourth quarter in 2011, primarily due to lower volatility, partially offset by higher volumes. Securities finance revenues was $74 million, a decline of 19% and 18% from the third quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2011, respectively. The decreases from both periods reflect lower spreads and volumes. Securities on loan averaged $305 billion for the fourth quarter of 2012, a decrease of 5% from the third quarter and 10% from the fourth quarter of last year due to lower overall demand. Processing fees and other revenue has been adjusted in the fourth quarter and in all prior periods presented to reflect a tax equivalent adjustment related to tax credits generated by tax-advantaged investments such as renewable energy and low-income housing. This adjustment enables management to compare revenue from all investments on a tax-equivalized or pretax basis similar to adjustments recorded to net interest revenue related to tax-exempt securities. For your benefit, we have included a table in Addendum B of the earnings presentation outlining the effective line items with and without the adjustment for the fourth quarter of 2012, as well as its effect on selected financial ratios. The adjustments, which are $36 million for the fourth quarter and $126 billion for the year, are offset by an equivalent amount of income tax expense and has no impact on our net income or earnings per share. Processing fees and other revenue increased 37% from the third quarter of 2012 primarily due to a $12-million increase in revenue from joint ventures which included a $7-million gain from the sale of an asset. Additionally, the quarter included a $10 million gain from the sale of a Lehman-related asset.","Processing fees and other revenue increased 92% from the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to a $25-million negative fair value adjustment related to exiting the fixed income trading initiative in the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as an increase in revenue associated with tax-advantaged investments. Net interest revenue on a fully-taxable equivalent basis declined 1.8% from the third quarter, primarily due to the lower yields on earning assets as the result of the persistent low interest rate environment. As we have noted, higher-yielding fixed-rate securities in our investment portfolio are maturing or paying down and being reinvested at lower rates while floating-rate assets are resetting at market rates.","Our net interest margin was 136 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 144 basis points in the third quarter of 2012 and 140 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2011. During the quarter, excess deposits remained elevated, averaging approximately $15 billion, a slight decrease from $16 billion in the third quarter.","Turning to expenses on Slide 11. You can see that overall expenses were well-controlled for the quarter. Total expenses increased 3% compared to the third quarter, an increase to 4.8% from the year ago quarter. Included in expenses for the fourth quarter of 2012 is $13 million related to the acquisition of the Goldman Sachs Administration Services business that was closed on October 15, 2012.","Compensation and employee benefits expenses were down slightly compared to the third quarter despite the incremental compensation assumed with the Goldman transaction and the support of new business. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, compensation employee benefits increased 4.9% due to higher benefit and incentive compensation costs, merit increases granted earlier in the year and acquisitions, partially offset by the savings realized from our business operations and IT transformation program.","In the fourth quarter, the compensation-to-revenue ratio was 37.2%. Excluding the taxable equivalent adjustment for tax-advantaged investments included in processing fees and other revenue, the compensation-to-revenue ratio was 37.7% for the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2011, information systems and communications expenses increased 10.9% and 20.0%, respectively. The increases from both periods were primarily related to the planned transition of certain functions to service providers as part of the Business Operations and IT Transformation Program, as well as additional cost to support growth in the business. These expenses are expected to continue to ramp up with a slight increase over the fourth quarter run rate into 2013 as we finalize the program implementation and transition to our service providers.","The business operations IT transformation program continues to be on track. Realization of expense savings accelerated during the fourth quarter and we achieved $112 million in incremental pretax expense savings for full year 2012, which is slightly ahead of our third quarter guidance of $90 million to $100 million of expected savings for 2012.","In the fourth quarter, our nonrecurring expenses related to the Business Operations and IT Transformation Program were approximately $36 million. These nonrecurring expenses should trail off in 2013 and 2014 as we near completion of the program.","The cumulative expense savings through the end of 2012 were $198 million. For 2013, we continue to anticipate achieving approximately $220 million in incremental pretax expense savings resulting in approximately $418 million of cumulative savings. For the entire program, we expect to achieve, consistent with our initial forecast, cumulative pretax savings in the range of $575 million to $625 million by 2015 compared to year end 2010, all else equal.","Now, turning to transaction processing. These expenses were up about 5% from the third quarter due to both higher market levels and volumes in the asset servicing business. Lastly, other expenses increased approximately 5% from the third quarter of 2012, driven by higher legal and regulatory cost, partially offset by a onetime Lehman-related client recovery of $14 million.","Now, I will turn to the balance sheet investment portfolio highlights on Slide 12. As outlined in the top half of the slide, the key elements of our strategy remain unchanged. Our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2012 was $120 billion, an increase of $5 billion from September 30, 2012. We have a solid credit profile with 89% of our portfolio securities rated triple or double A. The duration of the investment portfolio was 1.7 years at December 31, 2012, an increase from 1.5 years at September 30, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, 53% of our investment portfolio was invested in floating-rate securities and 47% in fixed-rate securities. The aggregate net unrealized aftertax gain in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of December 31, 2012 was $698 billion compared to a net unrealized after-tax gain of $577 million as of September 30, 2012. The improvement in the quarter was due primarily to narrower spreads.","During the fourth quarter, we invested about $11 billion dollars in primarily AA-rated securities at an average price of 101.5 with an average yield of 1.75% and duration of 4.28 years. Of the $11 billion, we invested $6.2 billion in agencies and agency debentures and $3 billion in asset-backed securities with the remaining investments spread among various asset classes. The duration GAAP of the entire balance sheet at year end was .36 years, up from .28 years at September 30, 2012. The increase was primarily due to fixed-rate portfolio purchases.","Turning to capital. Slide 13 has a summary of our strong capital position. Our capital ratios are displayed on this slide. As of December 31, 2012, our Tier 1 common ratio was 17.1%. Our estimated pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III NPRs, as we currently understand them, was 10.8%. Also as of December 31, 2012, the estimated pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III NPRs, including estimated effects of scheduled runoff and anticipated reinvestment of the securities affected by the SSFA through January 1, 2015, would be 11.9%. These estimates are subject to change based on several factors. As you know, the Basel III rules are not yet filed, and certain of our models are still under review by the Federal Reserve.","As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2012, the company issued fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock and redeemed its floating-rate perpetual preferred stock to take advantage of favorable market conditions. As a result, we declared and recorded 2 preferred dividend payments in the third quarter and accordingly did not record a dividend in the fourth quarter of 2012. We expect to return to the normal pattern of declaring quarterly preferred dividends in the first quarter of 2013.","To summarize our fourth quarter, our strong performance was driven by solid core fee revenue growth and a continued focus on controlling expenses. There were several onetime items totaling approximately $36 million on a pretax basis that favorably impacted our results, most of which I discussed when explaining sequential quarter changes.","Slide 14 outlines our outlook and assumptions for 2013. Looking ahead to 2013, we expect to continue challenging market environment despite the recent rise in equity markets. We are resuming, for planning purposes, for the S&P to increase 5% above 2012's daily average and the EAFE to increase approximately 2% above the 2012 daily average.","With respect to net interest margin. For 2013, we currently expect our average earnings assets to grow in a range of 1% to 4% and our operating basis net interest margin to be in the range of 130 to 140 basis points assuming interest rates, spreads and prepayments fees remain at their current levels through 2013. The impact of the expiration of the Transaction Account Guarantee program resulted in approximately $7 billion of deposits leaving our balance sheet since December 31, 2012. Given the expiration of TAG and absent any significant U.S. debt ceiling impacts, we expect to invest the remaining customer deposits in either highly liquid money market-type assets, including central bank deposits, or in investment portfolio assets depending on our assessment of the deposit characteristics. We expect to remain on track to deliver an additional pretax savings of approximately $220 million in 2013 from our business operations and IT transformation program, and we remain focused on controlling expenses across the company. We expect the compensation-to-revenue ratio to continue to decline in 2013 as we realize incremental savings from our Business Operations and IT Transformation Program. Our expectation is for a continued challenging operating environment in 2013.","In light of this uncertainty, we will not provide a specific compensation to revenue target for 2013. We'll continue to report the progress of our Business Operations and IT Program each quarter.","I would like to remind you that as in previous years, the first quarter of 2013, compensation and benefits expense will be higher due to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes. We expect the incremental amount attributed to equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter of 2013 to be approximately $125 million, up from the $100 million incremental amount in Q1 2012 over Q1 2011.","To align our expense base to the challenging environment in 2013, particularly related to our market-driven revenues, we recorded acquisition restructuring cost of $139 million, primarily related to a reduction force of approximately 630 positions. Most of the reduction in the headcount will be completed by 2013, and we expect the payback period of about 1.5 years due to the timing of employee departures.","The effective tax rate on an operating basis for full year 2013 is expected to be generally consistent with the last 2 years in the range of 23% to 25%.","And finally, and importantly, we will continue to optimize our strong capital position and return capital on the form of share purchases and dividends.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Jay.","Joseph L. Hooley","Thanks, Ed. Let me briefly conclude our comments with 3 points: One, in the fourth quarter, we delivered solid results in a very challenging economic environment and demonstrated core business momentum. We've continued to invest in our business expanding the range of solutions we are able to deliver to our clients, balancing this investment with aggressively controlling our cost. And I remain confident in the secular trends that underpin the prospects for growth in this business, and I believe we have the right focus in the short-term to position us well for continued strong performance. I'd like to say we appreciate our ongoing dialogue with shareholders and look forward to continuing to update you on the progress of our company.","And with that, I'd like to open the call for questions, Christy.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Howard Chen.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jay, you've read your commentary noting the recent re-risking that you've seen across the business. I realize we're probably early in that process, but can you help us size how much you believe that cumulatively maybe weighed on your servicing fees last year and how much you potentially have kind of recaptured so far with what you've seen?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I would say it's probably hard to size it, Howard, but I would just -- directionally, we saw it at the back end of the fourth quarter, kind of into December, where there was a noticeable move of clients rotating from fixed income or lower-risk assets into equities, and then as well as some cross-border assets. Europe was a fair amount of that focus. And then you've seen, as we've turned the corner into 2013, you've seen some industry stats with regard to equity flows. That trend continues. I think your question is really pointed towards that effect in the fourth quarter of 2012, fairly moderate, not a big factor given where it fell in the quarter.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then separately, I wanted to clarify the expense commentary. On the additional workforce actions that you announced today, what do you anticipate the savings relating to those are? And I wanted to confirm that that's incremental to the business Ops and IT transformation program that you've all been working on for a few years now.","Edward J. Resch","Yes, it is, Howard. It is absolutely incremental. The savings are in the range of $90 million annualized, so the payback's about 18 months on it. And, as I said, driven by, largely, the timing of the departures of the employees.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. So just a quick follow-up on that, Ed. If we put everything together, your rate and market outlook for the year, the acquisition that was done, I know you won't -- don't want to guide to a comp ratio, but how do we think about the puts and takes of overall expenses 2013 versus 2012?","Edward J. Resch","Well, I mean, again, it's largely driven by the -- first of all, operating leverage is paramount, right? So our thinking coming into 2013 is we're driving toward a year where we have positive operating leverage. Related to that, though, is the issue of how robust or not the market-driven revenues may or may not be in the year. So that'll largely drive the expense performance, I would say. But we're not planning on robust market-driven revenues, as I hope -- I've noted in my comments. So our expectation is that we'll be able to drive -- our plan is to drive positive operating leverage notwithstanding that, okay? Now there are puts and takes. We're -- we expect to achieve $220 million on the Ops and IT. We expect to achieve some benefit, as I said, on the reduction in force. But I'm not in a position to give you a number for the full year on expense growth overall, Howard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Ed, I was wondering if you could just kind of walk us through the changes and some of the tax stuff and where it's located relative to the improvement on the forward tax rate that you're expecting. How does that all net out versus just kind of a re-showing and restating? I mean, was anything incremental? Or is this just a logical restatement and they're showing it differently?","Edward J. Resch","Well, there's couple of things, I think, to your question, Ken, one in terms of the way in which we're presenting the tax-advantaged investments. We think that's a more meaningful presentation so we're just presenting them similarly to how we present municipal securities, i.e., grossing them up to present them on a pretax basis, okay? So the effect there is for the year to increase the processing fee and other line by $126 million, okay, and the related impact to the tax line, so no net effect. In terms of the tax rate for the year and moving forward, we expect 2013 to be broadly similar in terms of the effective rate to 2012, okay? That is driven by an assumption of relatively the same mix and, if the market opportunities present themselves, an increase in tax-advantaged investment activity during 2013.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the 24%, 26% -- the 23% to 25% guidance there was definitely lower than you had been thinking about previously, though? And but part of that presentation and part of that is what you're investing in differently?","Edward J. Resch","I'm sorry, Ken, can you repeat the beginning part of the question?","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I'm just trying to understand, the tax rate of 23% to 25% going forward is definitely lower than you had expected it previously. And then how much of that is just the presentation change versus any incremental investment that you're making that affect it incrementally?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, I mean, if there is an incremental effect in 2013, it's because of an expected increase, again assuming the opportunities are presented to avail ourselves of more tax-advantaged investment opportunities.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it, got it. All right. And then the second question, I just want to come back on the net interest margin outlook and understanding that the range that you gave is a little broader but it's certainly in line with how you've been talking about it versus the full year 2012. What I want to try to understand is, at what point do we get to a -- even in all things equal on rates, how close -- how much closer are we to the bottoming of the margin? So on full year, we'd presume that you're still exiting '13 lower each quarter, but are we closer by the end of this year to getting flattened out on the margin?","Edward J. Resch","Closer but, again, assuming the low rate environment persists for the next couple of years, our estimate is that it would bottom out at around 120 of net interest margin, and that's toward the end of '14, 2014.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, so the same context of the annual rollovers will still happen unless there's a meaningful change in the rate environment.","Edward J. Resch","Yes.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then the last thing for me is securities finance. Everyone's seeing the challenges in the business. With regards to activity and spreads, can you just give us a little more color of what's going on in that business line? How quickly does that business or could that business react to a change in improvement on the broader side? Does it lag? Does it lead? Any color there would be helpful.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, let me take that one, Ken. I think it probably lags the recovery in the economy and re-risking. And that business is really a byproduct of leverage put on by hedge funds and the demand for borrowed securities. So I would say, with recovering economic environment, re-risking, I think you'd see a greater demand for borrowed securities. The business can ramp very quickly. The customers that have committed their securities to the program continue to have their securities committed. And it's really just a matter of demand in the market, which can change quickly. Spreads, as you know, get influenced by the market, so the volume can flip pretty quickly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","First question I had, would it be possible to get a -- I'm kind of curious a little about fee differentials between the alternative business and the traditional asset servicing business. I mean, you broke out a little bit the contribution from the recent acquisition. But if I think of the $1.15 billion of servicing fees, I think, number one, it'd be helpful to get some sense of how much of that is being driven by your ALTs business, which I'm presuming is growing at a faster rate. And any kind of color you can give on how kind of the fee dynamics may differ between that and the rest of the book? Which I hadn't -- I know it's hard to do, it varies all over the place. But any kind of color you can give on kind of the mix and trend would be great.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, let me try that. The new business flows are actually pretty balanced between long-only and alternatives. We continue to cite alternatives because there's been continuous growth there, and we think, given our market position, we're capturing more share than most. I'd say the fee dynamics are pretty similar. The -- in the alternatives business, we have a middle office, back office component. Fees are quite similar in the alternative business increasingly over the past couple of years. Some custody of cash has been included in the product mix. So not a real difference. I would say, we continue to highlight it because the -- in the alternative segment, we get growth 2 ways. As flows come in and customers grow, we get growth that way, but there are still more outsourcing that's going on in the alternative segment, particularly in the private equity in the real estate segment. Hopefully that helps.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","It does. But maybe just to follow up. I mean, in thinking about within the total revenues, I mean, is it still kind of in the -- well, would it be in the kind of mid-teens kind of raised proportion of the total? I'm just trying to -- because that, obviously, from a modeling perspective, maybe kind of helped a little bit with...","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, let me -- give us a minute. Maybe we can give you some direction in that. So percentage of service fees, alternatives as percentage of service fees, is what you're trying to get at?","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Joseph L. Hooley","Right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Can you hear me?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, we got you, Brian. Well, we'll take your question and then we'll try to come back and answer Robert's question.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Sure, yes, yes, okay. So, I guess, along the lines of the new asset servicing mandates, can you give us a sense of, first of all, how much -- in addition to the $506 billion that's going to be converted in 2013, how much is left to be installed from prior new wins? And then just talk a little bit about the cross-sell that you alluded to with the GSAS business. It looks like operating margin there is around 45%. Just trying to get a sense of, sort of along the lines of Rob's question, how incrementally positive the growth in that business can be for your overall servicing effort and for operating margins.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, let me try to take those couple questions, Brian. I'll give you a little color on the $630 billion. Ed maybe can talk about the GSAS margin that we saw in the fourth quarter. Overall, robust quarter for new business growth, as I mentioned in my comments, pre-mix, and some -- a couple of large competitive wins that we saw where we had pretty good pricing on which we're happy with. The -- I gave you the breakdown of the $630 billion, what was installed last year, what will be installed this year. And this year, it'll roughly phase-in over the 3 quarters of the year. And by the way, I said $630 billion, it's really $649 billion, our business mandates. Ed, do you have the last quarter, what was installed; and what's left to be installed? That was another question Brian asked.","Edward J. Resch","I do not have it at hand, so we'll have to follow up with Brian.","Joseph L. Hooley","We'll Follow up with you on that one, Brian. With regard to the GSAS business, let me talk a little bit about the cross-sell, and then Ed can comment on the margins that we experienced in the quarter. As I mentioned, when we announced the acquisition of the Goldman Sachs hedge fund administration business, we thought it was a great business, a sterling set of customers, but we also thought that we had a broader product set that we could sell to that customer base. And in the early days, we've seen some success, largely around reporting services, things like PF reporting which is a routine reporting requirement for hedge funds. We have a pretty nice little service offering, many of the customers have taken it up. We've engaged them in conversations about additional products and services that we can bring on, still feel highly confident about the retention of 90-plus percent of that client base. So it's largely playing out the way we thought we would and we're still pretty excited about it. Ed, on the margin in the fourth quarter, do you want to comment on that?","Edward J. Resch","Sure. The margin was benefited by a little bit lower level of expenses in the quarter, Brian. We're looking at the business as being around a 35% margin kind of business pretax. So we did a -- better by about $3 million on the expense line than we projected. We closed it October 15, everything's on track. Revenue's coming in, customers are retained. But I'd be thinking about it more in a 30%, 35% type margin context, as opposed to 45%. We got a little bit of a benefit in the quarter.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. So it's still better than your core servicing business, it sounds like.","Edward J. Resch","A little bit.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then just on the balance sheet. So your expectation, it looks like around $170 billion size balance sheet, if I have that correct, for 2013 by your guidance. Is that 1% to 4% up of 2012 averages?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, yes.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and so getting to that bottom of $120 billion, I mean, if we get yield curves steepening, so no rate tightening of course, but if we get the treasury curve moving up, let's say, 50 basis points or so over the next 6 to 12 months and MBS yields maybe not coming up quite that much but directionally moving there. It -- I mean, it's hard to say exactly how much upside, but does that $120 billion -- and if we continue to get that curve steepening in 2014, does that $120 billion become obsolete and you'd start to get to the point where you get expansion from this $135 billion-ish range?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, probably. But I mean the $120 billion is the -- as to the question of what happens to the margin if rates stay this -- at these levels and very low for a protracted period of time, i.e., through 2015, as the fed's comments would suggest. If we have a different set of -- a different sense of the market rates that we're dealing with because the world's changed, then that $120 billion would change. And you're describing a scenario where $120 billion would go to some number higher than $120 billion, in all probability.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right, great. And so then just for the maturity schedule, roughly, what's rolling off of your book every year that you can deploy into new securities?","Edward J. Resch","I can give you the runoff that we're planning on for 2013. The runoff is just about $20 billion, and that is split just about 50-50 floating and fixed. And as we see 2014, if you want to go out that far, it's $22 billion, and that's split about 10 on floating and -- I'm sorry , 12 on floating and 10 on fixed, ballpark.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then just lastly, as this -- as your projection is coming down from the fourth quarter, I'd assume you're assuming excess deposits begin to roll off, would that be incrementally helpful to them as well?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, it would, and it's incorporated into my comments on the NIM expectations for this year. As we see the effects of TAG, which I noted, hitting our balance sheet, we don't expect a decline in total customer deposits. We just expect a decline in what we have called excess deposits. So the deposits that we have and retain will invest accordingly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","First question is, if you look over the last, say, 4 or 5 quarters, assets under custody grew nicely. Servicing fees actually grew pretty well, just not as much, and I'm assuming that's a little bit of the mix shift and the de-risking that happened through 2012. So I guess if the re-risking holds -- it doesn't have to zoom up from here, but if it holds what we saw in the last couple of weeks, 2013, could we expect a reversal, meaning servicing fees grow at a higher pace than you see just on the positive mix change?","Joseph L. Hooley","I think the -- as you've heard, Glenn, in my comments, the re-risking or the rotation to higher-risk assets back into the year, first part in the year, has been positive. Our base case assumes that doesn't sustain itself, based on whether it's the debt ceiling or any other number of factors that could influence investor behavior. So that's our base case, which I think is prudent. If the re-risking -- if the rotation into equities and global equities were to sustain itself throughout the year, which will be a very positive case, then yes, I think you would see that correlation between service fees and custody assets. Again, it's not -- we've seen this before over the last couple of years, a quick start and no follow-through, which is what we're assuming is going to happen.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Understood. Hope you're wrong.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, me too.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Yes. In FX, I think you compare nicely to a bunch of different peers of different flavors. Assuming in my mind that Currenex has a little something to do with that, but curious of the mix of business within FX.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, the -- I'll let Ed give you the specifics. But we did have -- I think the FX environment is still not great. Volatility continues to be constrained. We've got a multifaceted and, we think, quite attractive foreign exchange proposition, multiple ways to deliver foreign exchange. And I think what we saw in the quarter is success not only in our direct foreign exchange, which is where most of the positive quarter-to-quarter came from, but as Ed mentioned, we also continue to see growth in Currenex, which is the high-speed foreign exchange platform where we not only grew but, if the rest of the industry was down from a volume standpoint, we were up. So I think the trend is good and we think we're well positioned. Hopefully, volatility comes back, then it gets even better.","Edward J. Resch","Yes, it was a good quarter, Glenn, from the perspective of volumes, really, across the board. The direct business and custody FX increased slightly, a little bit over 1%. FX Connect was up over 8%, Currenex was up over 2%. So from a volume perspective, a pretty good story, really, across all execution methods.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Great. Final one, in asset management land. You're obviously in a sweet spot and it shows in your flows. Curious what -- where margins are at these days and just overall profitability trends, as I think that's the one area that you probably do have a pretty positive outlook on.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I think the story of the fourth quarter, I'm pleased with, but I'm also pleased with the whole year. I think we saw a pretty steady flow of net new flows into that business, ETF being probably the dominant theme pretty consistently through the year. And equally, we did a good job in controlling expenses, so I think we had a story in SSgA, our asset manager, where flows were good and they generated positive revenues. And we got good operating leverage based on our good expense control. As far as margins and...","Edward J. Resch","And the margin is clearly improved. I don't have it. We'll have it in the 10-Q segment footnote, Glenn.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just want to go back to the expense discussion, for a second. When you look, I guess, at the run rate right now, so like $1.7 billion for the quarter. And maybe there's a little bit more of a couple one-offs that helped you guys, so call it, like, a $1.73 billion or so. So you're annualizing, I guess, at like 6 9. Just from a core business perspective, what do you guys think you need to grow that by on an annual basis to keep kind of where the business momentum and the core businesses? And then on top of that, I'm assuming we'll obviously layer on the savings. But can we try to tackle the question this way?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, I mean, and unfortunately, I guess, Alex, the question is, again, answered in terms of how the market-driven revenues perform. And as I said, we're looking at the year cautiously from that perspective. That's part of the reason why we took the actions that we announced today to better calibrate our expense base to that market outlook. I will say, though, that overall for the year, from a planning perspective, we're coming in assuming, planning on generating positive operating leverage for the full year, okay? And that's with a conservative, muted, you could say, look, a view on the market-driven revenue. So that's the way we've done it. I'm -- I can't put a specific number on it in terms of what we think that, that $6.9 billion is going to move to, but we're incorporating all the cost of activities that we talked about, the ops, IT, the reduction of force that we announced today, in our planning.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, but I guess the reduction in force is really not hitting the numbers in 2013, right, that this is going to be, like, a 2014 effect and it's incremental to the 140 that you highlighted.","Edward J. Resch","Yes, the employees will be leaving over the course of 2013 which is why there's not going to be a full year effect in 2013's expense numbers for those departures. That's correct.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just following up on the last question. When I look at the business types that you guys are winning, a lot of the alternatives; a lot of middle office, the fee rate on those tends to be a little bit higher. If we, I guess, extrapolate from the numbers that you've given us, it feels like the Goldman business was maybe about 4 to 5 basis point type of fee rate. So, I guess, holding everything else equal, assuming that there's no incremental pickup in risk appetite and things kind of stay as they are, should we still -- shouldn't we just still see an improvement in the kind of the core servicing fee rate just given the mix shift in the business?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, I think, broadly, Alex, it was really the question I answered to the -- in the answer to a prior question, which is, if we see the mix shift, the mix shift being two things: one, the shift in mix of investments that our customers invest in, obviously a positive. When we talk about alternatives versus long-only, to make that broad differentiation, we're seeing pretty good growth in both sides of those, so I -- there's less of a mix shift effect on revenue growth from that.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just, I guess, the last one, on securities lending. The balance just seems like you keep going down. Any sign of stabilization? Where do you guys see this troughing out?","Joseph L. Hooley","I think I would have thought it was troughed out now. It's really a demand in the market question. I think it's hovered for many quarters in the 350 to 300 range. There's just not much demand for borrowing of securities, so I -- it's hard to call it. I do -- to my earlier point, I think markets heal, customers re-risk. That's one you'll likely to see the demand for borrowing recover. And when it recovers, I think you'll see a bounce in our securities lending business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","On the business operation transformation program. So, I guess, you have $200 million of savings the last 2 years and you look for $220 million of savings this year and, I would say, $200 million in 2014, roughly. So in other words, this should be the biggest payoff year from this 4-year kind of endeavor. And so I'm just wondering how you feel about getting that big payoff. I mean, you started before many others in the industry to change how you operate. How has the expected ROI tracked according to expectations? How far along are you in your cloud transformation? And what other color can you give us from the operational side?","Joseph L. Hooley","Sure. Let me start that, Mike. And you're right, the first 2 years ending '12 were $100 million a year, roughly, ramps to $220 million this year, and $214 million is the plan that we've had from the beginning. The progression has been correcting some -- or improving some processes, moving to Centers of Excellence. And then the third leg of that is really introducing new technology to further automate those core processes. And we're squarely midstream in it. I think we've been pretty on track with regard to the performance against our original plan. I have a high level of confidence that we're going to achieve the 2013 goal. We are operating under our private cloud environment. I think we have, roughly, 50 applications that have been operational for over a year. So that's been tested, and confident that the technology is in place. We're building systems as part of this. There can always be some slippage when you build systems, but it's not one system, it's hundreds of applications. So I think I have a lot of confidence that we'll stay the course on this. Not only will we stay the course, but we will achieve the targets that we set out for 2013 as well as '14. And just -- let me just make one more comment, Mike, because I know you'll appreciate this. I just want to -- to me, this is about efficiency effectiveness, reducing cost, eliminating errors, but it's really the transformation that's going to enable us to introduce new information-based products and services to our customers. So it has that dimension to it too. Go ahead.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","It -- is there one quarter or one day when you say you'll shut off the dual systems and you go live from development to the main platform? I mean, you have to run multiple systems until you get through this. When's the day?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, well, there isn't because, fortunately, and I say this fortunately, it's not 1 system, it's not 10 systems, there's some 200 projects, so that's -- there's many systems or applications that we're redeveloping to -- and we're redeveloping them in the cloud in parallel. So there's -- as a result, there's no day, there's no quarter. It -- they -- it happens throughout 2013 and 2014. As a result, I think that it's a less-risky proposition, in my opinion.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Why is this the biggest payoff year?","Joseph L. Hooley","It's just the way it ramped. Initially, the -- initially, we had process improvements. We moved to lower-cost locations. The technology -- the efficiency effect from the application of new technology has proportionately higher payoff than the human side of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On NIM, what changed in your NIM guidance? Your prior range, has this come down? You'd earlier talked about '14 being just around $130 billion, and now the '13 is going to $130 billion to $140 billion, given that the 10 years moved up a little bit and you're expecting the TAG deposits have started to go out, so -- which would help NIM. So could you explain what's changed that guidance?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, Vivek, we've previously said we thought 2013 would be in the range of $130 billion to $140 billion. I think that our comments this morning are consistent with that...","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It wasn't $135 billion, okay, I thought it was...","Edward J. Resch","Yes, no. We may have spoken and just used the middle -- midpoint of the range as a point of discussion, but our overall thinking in terms of 2013's NIM has really not changed. And in terms of the U.S. Treasury 10-year being at 1.80%, 1.90% today, in actuality, if -- even if that was the rate that persisted throughout all of 2013, the effect as we model it would be, maybe in the range of $15 million or $20 million in terms of our net interest revenue, so 1 basis point or 2 on NIM. And the reason for that is because we have $10 billion, as I mentioned earlier, $10 billion of fixed-rate assets rolling off. And our budgeted rate for the year is about 160, so you can do the math on that. The 30-basis-point differential applied to that on average of -- for half a year, would give you the $15 million or $20 million improvement. So not much of an effect, again, assuming the curve doesn't change shape, just steepens.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And given your commentary about the $120 billion towards the end of '14, so should that imply more like a $125 billion as an average '14?","Edward J. Resch","Well, again, if the question is -- assuming rates stay low for a protracted period of time and the curve doesn't change, $120 billion is our estimate of where the margin would bottom out in '14. If we have a steepened curve from where we are today through 2014, then the $120 billion would be a higher number. Okay?","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And one other question, on the comp expense in the fourth quarter, was there anything related -- it was flattish, it seemed like, so nothing -- any change related to incentive comp accruals, anything like that, that we need to be aware of?","Edward J. Resch","Nothing significant. I mean, we went through the normal year-end process of setting incentive compensation in accordance with the company's overall performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery [ph].","Unknown Analyst","Obviously, there's been a pre-sizable move in your stock price over the last quarter, currently, I think, about 15% higher than the average purchase price for 2Q -- or Q4, I'm sorry. Does that change your appetite for buybacks and perhaps how you are going to execute your capital distribution goals this quarter or for this coming year? And obviously, we haven't had a look at your CCAR plan for 2013, but it sounds like you have aggressive goals to distribute capital. So would you have any flexibility in your plan to consider a special dividend in lieu of buybacks?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, the recent change in the stock price doesn't change our outlook. We put our CCAR plan in earlier in the year. The -- and we look at, really, a distribution between buybacks and the dividend rate. There's some guidance around dividend rate from the fed. Special dividend is something that we've thought about but haven't really considered.","Unknown Analyst","Would you have to build that into your CCAR plan? Or is that something you can default to if you -- if the stock price runs up too much?","Joseph L. Hooley","No. I think you absolutely have to build it in. And I -- my sense would be it wouldn't be encouraged by the fed because of the onetime nature of it versus the laddered effect of either buybacks or dividends.","Unknown Analyst","And then I just wanted to come back to Glenn's question on SSgA's margin. You noted the progress this year, so that's great, but it continues to look a bit lower than some of your peers that I think would be comparable to you. So I was wondering if you might conjecture as to why that is. Is it because your product suite is more commoditized? Is it cost allocation related to the overall business? Is it ad hoc bundled pricing with custody services? And then what adjustable steps do you think you could consider to improve the margin more?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, Luke, let me -- that -- it's hard to get good comparison, I think, as a starting point. We think that we, obviously, have a mix which is more anchored around passive strategies and cash. I think that, as opposed to looking at trying to reconcile our margin versus others, our objective has been to improve the margin. And we think we're on a track to do that on a sustainable basis, what we've done to invest in areas of the business that we think have higher growth prospects, whether it's defined contribution segment, ETFs continuing to expand outside the U.S. while, at the same time, much as we've done for the whole firm, is really take a hard look at the cost model and say what's essential and necessary, what's not necessary and how to create more efficiencies. The benefits that State Street realizes as a result of IT and operations also translate to SSgA. So I look at it more from a standpoint of how do we continuously widen the margin, improve the business, grow the top line, as opposed to trying to compare it discretely to other models in which, in many cases, are not apples to apples.","Unknown Analyst","And then a final one. I'm sure you're aware that BNY Mellon is establishing a CSD in Europe. They're indicating that it has strategic benefits with respect to collateral management, internalization of settlement, maybe linking to T2S. So I'm wondering if you think it places you at any competitive disadvantage that you're not going to offer these services, or if you'd be interested in making a move into the upstream market.","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, we -- the centralized securities depositories, that is an opportunity. It's a -- the regulation in Europe is changing, and we took a pretty long look at whether or not that made sense for us. We, through our sub-custody arrangements, we use CSDs all across the globe, and concluded that where it might be an opportunity from some, that we have better opportunities in other parts of our business from a standpoint of return on capital. It would get us into a new regulatory regime. We think it's kind of a cost re-entry to get into the CSD world. So we've taken a good look at it and concluded that we've got better options.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Levin.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If it's re-risking you're seeing, if this really is the beginning of a sustained trend and your business starts to improve and that really looks sustained, how does that impact your thinking about your cost-cutting program?","Joseph L. Hooley","It doesn't change it. I think that the cost-cutting effort is really about creating sustained efficiency in the operating model. And it was conceived in an environment where there was pressure on that, but the closer we get to it, it's a no-regrets move. It's a way to improve on a sustained and structural basis the operating cost to run this business. And it not only has cost efficiencies but it should lower error rates and will position us for being able to produce new products on the back of a cloud environment that will enable kind of real-time data information and analytics. So we're going to do nothing but stay the course.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then on capital return, as you think about how much to return, I mean, you -- how do you think about the relationship between the fact that you're over-capitalized relative to your long-term target but your near-term outlook -- earnings outlook is somewhat cloudy just because of the environment we're in? How do you think about the relationship between those 2 items?","Joseph L. Hooley","Well, I think that the CCAR process itself brings those issues together quite nicely. And it's an exercise that we do, obviously, for submission to the Fed, but it allows us internally to look at, over multiple periods, what we think the earnings opportunities are for the business, what our capital position is, how that gets affected by things we do in the future. And so it's all blended in. It combines the organic growth potential of the business as well as the starting capital position, and the required capital requirements as Basel III starts to unfold and become implemented. So it's all ready to growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just back on expenses. Can you guys just clarify a little bit in terms of what's different about this new initiative versus the original and sort of, kind of, when you step back, kind of why is it needed if you had this kind of long-standing, big-initiative IT cloud expenses over the last couple of years?","Joseph L. Hooley","So you're referring to the initiative, the reduction in force that we announced this morning.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Joseph L. Hooley","We -- again, we've been living in a constrained revenue environment for some time. And as I've mentioned a few times, we -- our base case is we're going to continue to live in that environment. And the IT and Ops transformation is a structural redo of how we're offering services to our customer, as I mentioned previously. We also look at all other parts of our business and say, \"Are there ways to become more efficient? Are there ways to apply process improvements? Are the things that we've done historically that aren't critical or necessary today?\" So it's really just part of an ongoing effort to make sure that we're looking at everything, to make sure that we're as lean and as efficient as we can be while at the same time not disturbing customer service levels, our ability to invest in high-growth businesses, and do the things that are productive for us long-term. So it's just really good management discipline.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And, well, that sounds like the original kind of IT cloud initiatives. And it -- so is -- are we to read in this recent staff reduction as an offshoot of that, in incremental? Or that's just part of the culture going out of it?","Joseph L. Hooley","No. The IT and Ops transformation was really targeted at our core global asset servicing business where we do -- for the 24 trillion in assets that we service, we conduct many different transactional activities. In fact, around 18 different transactional activities is where most of the work gets done. And it was the redo, it was the change, the process change where we do the work and change the technology around those core activities that are the IT and Ops transformation project. There's a whole bunch of other places in the company where we spend money to support different business lines and staff functions, and it's really those other things that are largely targeted by this announcement we made this morning.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of the ultimate benefit from the original IT cloud initiative, going back, you had long talked about the ultimate benefits, $600 million pretax, but then ultimately a 400-basis-point benefit to your operating margin, if I recall correctly. Is -- does that still hold in this new environment?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, we believe it does, Andrew. I mean, I'll give you some numbers which takes you through the first 2 years of the project where, as we've noted, we've achieved about $200 million of the overall program. And again, predicating these comments on 2010, which is our base year, okay, we've gotten 200 basis points of margin which we count against what we'll call the core business, and the core has expanded 160 basis points, okay, in total. And adjusting for the onetimers, that brings the margin -- the starting margin down by 170 basis points. Those are mainly, as you recall, insurance recoveries that we got in 2010. So the core expanding at 1.6% over the first 2 years, with the accomplishment of the 200 basis points against the program considering that our market-driven revenues, specifically trading services, have been rather weak over those 2 years, we think is -- while not certainly in excess of what we expected, it's tracking in the right direction and showing positive momentum in terms of the effect of the Ops and IT program.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","All right, that's helpful. And then should we also -- I mean, does that all still roll up to operating margins in the low 30s, ultimately, in the out years?","Edward J. Resch","Yes, I mean, that's -- I mean, we started with the margin around 28%, and we estimated 400 basis points improvement, again predicated against 2010, all else equal, which so far, relative to the trading services, it has not been. But yes, with those assumptions, we would expect 28% pretax margin to improve to around 32% pretax margin.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, Jay, any update on the CFO search, how it's -- where that stands now?","Joseph L. Hooley","Yes, let me just give you -- as we announced, Ed had -- has come to me and said he'd like to hang up his spikes in 2013. And as a result of that, we are going through a process looking at suitable replacement candidates, and we're in the middle of that right now, nothing really to update. Ed has assured me he would stay on through a smooth transition. So nothing really to update, other than, in subsequent quarters as we do have something to report, we'll certainly bring it forward.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess just to come back to the question of the servicing fee rates. Is it possible to tease out a little bit the impact of global versus U.S. on those fee rates in the quarter, as opposed to a rotation to equity and maybe by giving some sense of how many of those fee rates are tied to global versus U.S. within equity? And then along those lines, could you give us a sense of how your wins are breaking down?","Joseph L. Hooley","Let me start that with the last part of the question. I'm not sure we're going to be able to be very helpful on the front part. The wins, the $649 billion, was roughly 85-15, 85 U.S., 15 non-U.S. That's source, so that would be U.S.-based customers. That's a little bit of a different mix than what we've seen. That's a little bit more tilted to the U.S. where I think we've been running more probably 50-50 non-U.S., U.S. So that's on the win side. On the...","Edward J. Resch","I mean, I'll take a stab at it. And I don't have specific numbers for the fourth quarter, Cynthia, but I think the way that it might be helpful to think about it is that approximately 40% of our revenue is from outside the U.S. So that's one way of thinking about the servicing fee line, I think that's valid. From a pricing perspective, I think it's also valid to look at the non-U.S. business as being generally higher priced, and it's higher priced but it's also higher cost against it. So net-net, you probably have around the same pretax kind of margin for that kind of business. And again, I don't have specific numbers that I could quote you with, but that -- quote to you, but that's where we are. I think, two, if you look at State Street from an asset servicing perspective, we're probably around 50-50 in terms of equity versus fixed income, maybe a little bit more skewed to the equity markets than some of our close-end competitors. So hopefully, that's -- that gives you some guidance in terms of your question.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, that's really helpful. And then I guess, maybe to poke into a more esoteric area. It looks like your transition management revenues were up pretty well this quarter, and I'm just wondering if you could give a little color on that business. What is it that drove that? What -- is there a seasonal component to that? Maybe a sense of how profitable that is compared to other businesses.","Joseph L. Hooley","The transition management, it is a little bit narrower business, just -- you know but just for the broad audience, when an investment manager is going to replace a manager in their asset allocation mix, will make moves. They might hire somebody like State Street to execute that change. So it's a transactional-type activity. It is a little bit lumpy in that it's driven by manager rotations either in and out of asset classes or in and out of managers. We've got a, I think, a highly competitive product across the globe in transition management, so we compete quite well in that space. I think the quarter was probably the result of a little bit more market-based activity and us being successful in winning those deals. I think, generally, transition management has been, against historical rates, a little bit soft over the last several quarters as a result of maybe a lack of conviction by investment managers around market direction. As people do change and as you see broad-based moves in asset allocations or even managers transition management activity, you'd expect to see that pick up.","Joseph L. Hooley","Great. Let me just -- that was the last question, but there was a question that Robert Lee asked that I think we have an answer to, so I'll ask Ed to respond to that.","Edward J. Resch","Yes. There's actually one from Rob and, I think, one from Brian Bedell that, I think, got cut off on, so I just wanted to answer both of them. First, Rob asked about the revenue on alternatives business broadly. And the answer to the question is, about 15% of our servicing fee revenue on an annual basis, around $600 million annual, is the revenue associated with alternative asset servicing business. Secondly, Brian, I believe, asked how much was remaining to be installed from our wins in 2012. And the answer to that is $550 billion, including what we won in the fourth quarter. So for all of 2012, what remains spilling over into 2013 is $550 billion of assets to be installed.","Joseph L. Hooley","Thanks, Ed. And I -- thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call today. I'll just remind you that we have our own investor and analyst forum which will be held on February 28 at the Mandarin Hotel in New York, and hope to see all of you then. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"20380":["State Street Corp.

Ostler - State Street Corp.","Thanks, Hope. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, will speak first. Then, Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our first quarter 2017 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit your questions to two questions and then re-queue.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include operating-basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measures are available in the appendix to our 1Q 2017 slide presentation.","In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors referenced in our discussion today, in our 1Q 2017 slide presentation under the heading Forward-Looking Statements, and in our SEC filings including the Risk Factors section of our 2016 Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.","Now, let me turn it over to Jay.","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter 2017 results reflect our business momentum across asset servicing and asset management. Strong fee revenue growth coupled with expense control and good progress against our strategic priorities drove significant positive fee operating leverage.","On an operating-basis, we increased return on equity by 200 basis points and our earnings per share by 23% from the first quarter last year. Our new business traction is solid, as we continue to invest in our technology and systems, benefiting customers and investors, and our pipeline remained strong.","We continue to see strong trends for asset managers to consolidate providers as a way to create efficiencies and improve information needs. Recent mandates would support this trend. We believe State Street has the unique advantage of being able to service complex and global assets on an integrated service platform. This coupled with our investment in technology and digitizing our processes enables us to extract meaningful data and insights for our clients that they would be hard-pressed to obtain anywhere else.","We see two other secular growth trends that play to our strengths. The shift towards passive investing is increasing business given our 55% plus share of ETF servicing, and the expansion of international asset managers with multijurisdictional offshore funds is buoying our international growth given our global capabilities.","These advantages are illustrated by our 11% increase in assets under custody and administration versus the first quarter of 2016, reflecting strengthening markets, improved client flows and the contribution of our new business wins over the past year. As Eric will lay out for you in more detail, based on the strong start to 2017, our outlook has improved modestly from our January 2017 outlook and remains within our previously disclosed ranges.","Turning to slide number four, I'll now review our progress on our strategic priorities and some key achievements this year. We continue to drive growth from our core franchise, with new asset servicing wins of approximately $110 billion for the quarter, reflecting mandates from clients around the world. In our total new business yet to be installed at quarter-end was approximately $375 billion, which is above typical levels over the past two years. We also saw continued momentum in SSGA's ETFs, driven by flows and improving equity markets.","State Street Beacon continues to progress with further investments and adoption of our technologies. We're also engaging with our clients to co-create and prototype solutions to meet their needs. Examples include some of our key clients' global adoption of accounting technologies, enabling a 20 to 30-minute improvement in the end-of-day delivery of net asset valuations to clients' distributors. We also continue to make investments in innovative solutions to address client needs across regulatory requirements, risk and analytics. Some examples include our solutions to meet the SEC Modernization reporting and liquidity risk management rules.","Our DataGX solution that provides tools and analytics on client and third-party data continues to gain traction from asset owners globally to support their evolving needs. We launched the distribution of the GX Private Equity Index to approximately 300 global asset management clients to enable them to improve benchmark analysis of private equity performance. We're developing and launching new analytical tools to enable clients to better manage environmental, social and governance exposures, as these investment strategies continue to gain traction and importance. And lastly, as we showed at an investor conference in February, we have launched a pilot mobile app for chief risk officers to manage their exposures real-time.","Now let me talk about SSGA. SSGA finished the quarter with $2.56 trillion in assets under management, a 4% increase from fourth quarter 2016 and a 12% increase from 1Q 2016. The majority of the growth from 1Q 2016 was driven by market appreciation, with an additional 5% of growth in the acquired GE Asset Management business, which is performing very well.","SSGA achieved strong revenue gains during the quarter, driven in part by the momentum of our ETF strategies, which are benefiting from investments in distribution and product development, such as the SSGA SHE ETF launched last year to help increase visibility of the importance of gender diversity across corporate boards and management. And we're delighted by the overwhelming response to Fearless Girl, which demonstrates the power of fulfilling this objective.","We continue to make good progress in the integration of the acquired GE Asset Management business. Notably, for the first nine months, we've achieved accretive operating-basis earnings.","In closing, we remain committed to expense control, as reflected by our 1Q 2017 positive fee operating leverage of approximately 570 basis points and total operating leverage of approximately 220 basis points from 1Q 2016. And in 1Q 2017, through share repurchase and common share dividends, we returned approximately $665 million of capital to common shareholders, which was $150 million ahead of schedule.","Now I'll turn the call over to Eric Aboaf, who moved into the CFO role at the end of February. Eric will review our financial performance for the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2017, after which we'll take your questions. Eric?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 5 where I'll start my review of our first quarter 2017 operating-basis results, which supplement our GAAP results. As you can see, we have made a conscious effort this quarter to narrow the differences.","Operating-basis EPS for 1Q 2017 increased to $1.21 per share, up 23% from 1Q 2016, reflecting higher equity markets, new business wins, continued expense discipline, and fewer shares outstanding. 1Q 2017 results reflect strong fee revenue growth over 1Q 2016 in both asset servicing and asset management.","At the same time, we carefully managed the expenses with the help of State Street Beacon, delivering over a 5.5 percentage points of positive fee operating leverage over 1Q 2016. This includes 2.3 percentage points from the sale of BFDS\/IFDS and the GE Asset Management acquisition.","Slide 5 also highlights a few notable items that impacted both GAAP and operating-basis results this quarter. First, we recorded an after-tax gain related to the sale of BFDS\/IFDS of $31 million, or $0.08 per share, as we continue to focus increasingly on our core business.","Second, we took the opportunity to tactically reposition a portion of the investment portfolio for the current rate environment, which will improve NII going forward. That cost $32 million after-tax, or $0.08 per share.","Third, our first quarter results in both 2016 and 2017 included the seasonal effect of deferred incentive compensation for retirement-eligible employees. All-in-all, pre-tax margin was up 1.7 percentage points and ROE was up 2 percentage points to 10.4% as compared to 1Q 2016.","Now let me turn to slide 6 to briefly review growth of two key drivers of our businesses. AUCA increased 11% from 1Q 2016, driven by market appreciation, higher inflows in the U.S. from asset managers and ETFs, partially offset by the continued rotation out of hedge funds. Notably, we also experienced strong growth in Europe relating to both onshore and offshore markets. As compared to 4Q 2016, AUCA also saw a good step-up, which positions us well for the rest of the year.","Turning to State Street Global Advisors, AUM increased 12% from 1Q 2016, driven by market appreciation and the impact of the acquired GE Asset Management operations, partially offset by some net outflows. We did see strong ETF inflows again, but we continued to expand our products array.","Please turn to slide 7 where I'll review 1Q 2017 revenue compared to 1Q 2016. You'll also find detail in the appendix with a comparison to 4Q 2016. Servicing fees increased 4%, primarily due to higher equity markets and strong growth in net new business across the globe and across multiple client segments, partially offset by continued hedge fund outflows.","As compared to 4Q 2016, we saw this momentum continuing. Management fees increased 41%, driven by the contribution of the acquired GE Asset Management business, higher equity markets and higher yielding ETF inflows. As compared to 4Q 2016, performance was strong as well.","Trading services increased slightly relative to 1Q 2016 as a result of higher volumes in foreign exchange trading. Securities finance revenue decreased slightly from 1Q 2016, reflecting lower short-interest in equity markets during the quarter. Processing fees and other revenue increased primarily due to the BFDS sale and the absence of some FX swap costs. Please note that these FX swap costs are now in net interest income this quarter as they qualified for hedge accounting.","Moving to slide 8, NIM was up 5 basis points from 1Q 2016. NII increased primarily reflecting higher market interest rates in the U.S. and disciplined liability pricing, partially offset by lower interest-earning asset and lower non-dollar investment portfolio yields. As compared to 4Q 2016, NIM was up 9 basis points, also due to higher rates and disciplined liability pricing, even after considering the additional FX swap costs now in interest expense.","Now I'll turn to slide 9 to review expenses. 1Q 2017 expenses increased 6% in total from 1Q 2016, but half, or 3% of that, came from $51 million of GE Asset Management expenses. Compensation employee benefits is impacted in the first quarter of each year by seasonal deferred incentive compensation for retirement-eligible employees.","Compared to 1Q 2016, the seasonal impact increased by $32 million, driven by a higher number of employees who fell within the retirement age window. Aside from this increase, we saw expected headwinds like annual merit increases, new business, onboarding costs, and technology investments, which were offset by savings from State Street Beacon. As compared to 4Q 2016, expenses were up only slightly, excluding this 1Q 2017 seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense and the 4Q 2016 acceleration of deferred cash awards.","Let me now move to slide 10 to review our progress on State Street Beacon. Beacon remains on track to achieve $550 million in targeted program savings, including at least $140 million in 2017. But Beacon is also designed to enhance client solutions, reduce operational risk, and engage our teams throughout the enterprise.","As Jay mentioned, we are striving towards a highly digitized environment, which has already been delivering tangible client benefits. Notably, Beacon is now driving innovation, such as our recently launched SEC Modernization products, which we expect can contribute to our top line revenue growth in the future.","We're also mitigating risk and gaining efficiencies by automating controls and improving monitoring technology. And lastly, our Beacon program is now addressing opportunities across our enterprise. Our SSGA Beacon effort is focused on client experience, front-office optimization, and operational effectiveness, and we are tackling our corporate function costs as well.","Now let's turn to slide 11 to review our balance sheet and capital position. We continue to maintain a high-quality balance sheet, including an investment portfolio with a well-constructed and diversified mix of securities. As I mentioned earlier, during 1Q 2017, we had the opportunities to make some tactical adjustments given market trends.","On the capital front, our position remains strong, and it remains a key priority to return capital through share repurchases and dividends. We retired $523 million of common stock this quarter, which includes our quarterly plan plus consideration received as part of the BFDS\/IFDS sale. We have $227 million remaining under our June 2016 common stock purchase program. As expected, our supplementary leverage ratio increased as we tighten the size of our balance sheet.","Moving to slide 12, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook. With a strong start to 2017 in hand, we remain focused on achieving our 2017 outlook, which has improved modestly from our January projection. Our priorities continue to be: driving top line growth in our core franchise by delivering solutions to our clients, prudently managing expenses as we execute on State Street Beacon, and returning capital to shareholders.","There are three areas that I would like to highlight in the outlook. First, we now expect our 2017 operating-basis fee revenue to be at the middle to higher end of the 4% to 6% growth range, assuming the favorable market conditions continue to prevail.","Second, our NII outlook now assumes a rising rate scenario, which anticipates that the Fed increases again in September. We now expect full year 2017 operating-basis NII to be at the upper end of our original $2.27 billion to $2.3 billion range. That said, we are carefully watching long rates.","And third, we now expect our operating-basis tax rate to be at the lower end of the 30% to 32% target we communicated in January.","Let me briefly touch on the second quarter of 2017 before turning the call back to Jay. We expect momentum in servicing fees to continue in 2Q 2017, driven by client flows and net new business. We expect trading services activity to continue to be muted, while expecting a seasonal uptick in securities finance. Neither the BFDS gain in fees nor the securities repositioning are expected to repeat. NIM should be up in the mid single-digits with the balance sheet down slightly, resulting in an increase in NII of several percent.","In summary, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve our full year 2017 financial objectives.","Now, let me turn the call back to Jay.","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Thanks, Eric. Our long-term growth is being fueled by State Street Beacon and the way ahead. And after 225 years, we can step back and see what has made us successful. It's been our people, technology, insights, and experience combining to create enhanced asset intelligence for our clients. Our future success will be driven by these strengths and our ability to further differentiate ourselves by transforming the way data is utilized to provide additional capabilities to our global client base.","Now, Hope, I'd like to open the call to investor questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to see if you could help us understand some of that push and pull between NII and the processing other. Eric, you didn't mention it in your forward commentary, so can you just walk us through, does that elevated processing and other result, ex the $30 million gain, now stay and then we see the direction change in NII? Or maybe you could just help us through understand that dynamic and what happens from here? Thanks.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Sure, Ken, it's Eric. Let me just take you through it so that you've got a good visibility. I think what you've seen us do this quarter as we designated the bulk of the FX swap activity that we've been doing for a number of quarters and years as economic hedges against the deposits. And as a result, those FX swap costs now sit in NII as opposed to in processing fees. I think that's a kind of \u2013 it's a natural way to report our NII and NIM. And our expectation is we'll continue to do that going forward and reflect them along those lines.","I think if you're just looking for the numbers, I'm happy to share those with you. On a year-over-year basis, the swing was about 3 bps. On a quarter-over-quarter, it was about 5 bps. And now I think we've got a good path going forward.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","And just to confirm then, how do we think about that processing and other line, given \u2013 I think you mentioned lower energy credits and that's got some seasonality in it. So if we start at $152 million (20:30), is that now where we go from here?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","I think the \u2013 you really have to do two things on the processing and other line, which always have some volatility in it, right? One is you've got to take out the BFDS\/IFDS gain, right? And then secondly, you've got to remove the 5 basis points worth of swap costs. That was about $25 million on the science (21:01) of our balance sheet and use that as the new baseline. I will remind you, there's always some volatility in that line, plus\/minus some. So just keep an eye on that and look back over the past, I think it will give you a bit of an indication.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And if I could just ask one more just on the BlackRock you had \u2013 Jay had mentioned last quarter that he'd expected it to start to roll out in the second half. Can you just update us on timing of that? Is that still incorporated in your guidance and if it's changed at all? Thanks.","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Sure, Ken. This is Jay. Happy to do that. The BlackRock transition will occur beginning in 2018, not 2017, and is likely to take several quarters to be completed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Hi. How are you?","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Good morning.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Question on deposit beta. I mean, it looks a little higher than what we've seen at some of the other companies. I'm just curious, is that just a function of client franchise and how you want to roll, or is there anything contractual that goes towards how the higher rates flow through on the liability side?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Glenn, it's Eric. Let me take that. The client beta is you have to actually \u2013 you have to look carefully at the average interest-earning schedule to decipher. This quarter, they were in the 20% to 25% range, which is I think what we've seen towards the start of a rate cycle in the past what we saw a year ago. The way to extract them from that average earning schedule is to take a look at the U.S. deposit costs, U.S. interest-bearing costs. You saw those nudge up about 6 basis points quarter-over-quarter, right, relative to a 25 basis point hike by the Fed.","If you also look down at the total interest-bearing or the non-U.S. interest-bearing deposit costs, just remember, the swap costs affect that line, and so there'll be some noise there that you just have to account for.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","I got that. Okay. And, I guess, this is an ongoing question. The revenue growth targets are obviously still in the 8% to 12% range. I think they were maybe 5% ex-GE, but the fees were better. It's more like 8%. But any way slice it, I think fees grow a little less than assets. Do you think of that as just like that's the world we live in, there's some fee compression, there's some mix shift, and we make it up on volume and give the operating leverage, they'll be happy.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","I think there is a fair number of themes you just covered in a short sentence, but I think you've got the gist of it. I think what you'll find is, as asset values increase, right \u2013 they were up, asset values year-over-year against our mix of equity and fixed income and all were up about 10%, for example \u2013 you'll naturally see just because of the denominator effect, the fee rate flowed down. So I think that's just part of the dynamic of the math, and then that's further impacted by mix.","I think you are right, though. If you think about the buildup of revenue growth in an asset servicing business, it starts from how much asset appreciation do you expect year-over-year, right, and we've got the last 10, 20, 30 years to look at. You think about flows, right. Are you servicing asset managers who are bringing inflows as opposed to seeing net outflows. So that matters.","You then add net new business, right. Are you gaining a point of market share or 2 points, like what the \u2013 how effective are you doing that. And, obviously, one of the reasons for that Beacon investment and the technology and the sophistication in the global offering we add is to push that in the right direction.","There is always a little bit of pricing headwind. I think there is a little bit of pricing headwind in this business and every business that one operates in, but that's got to be made up. And then there is foreign exchange swings up and down. So those are kind of the \u2013 that's the algebra that I think we think about and, obviously, a number of those we can control. And that's how we're focused.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Awesome. Thanks, Eric. Appreciate it.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to follow up on the question on deposit beta. So I appreciate what we've seen here so far. How are you feeling, though, on a go-forward basis? What's your sense for the gamma on the beta, so to speak? In other words, how should we think about trajectory of beta from here?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","I still remember that you asked about the gamma on beta. I think that's the second derivative, if I remember properly from my calculus days. I think it's a fair question. Betas have been relatively low by past historical standards. We saw 20% to 25% this quarter. We saw about that a year ago, though, it's hard to always calibrate the very first uptick.","We expect this level again in second quarter, right, at least within that range, given what we see so far. I think what happens after that is the broader question \u2013 what happens if there is a hike in September, what happens with hikes next year \u2013 because we all know that betas for past cycles are in the 50%, 60% range. And the question is \u2013 will those repeat themselves and, if so, when.","Obviously, the environment has changed, right? The money market fund and offering is weaker than it's been before, so that could be a positive for banks when you think about betas. On the other hand, there are always pressures the other way. So we'll see. But so far, we've seen I think healthy betas and kind of a good balance, and we expect that to play out for the next hike or two.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","And sorry about the gamma there. I'm certainly \u2013 I talk too much to derivative traders, I guess. So, to paraphrase, you don't think there is going to be a significant change in the beta, albeit maybe a natural ramp, is that fair?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yeah, that's fair. Given what we know today, I think that's our current expectation.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Terrific, terrific. Thank you very much. And then just curious if you could give some color on the outflows with the institutional business? What is it that you think is driving that? And maybe what adjustments you guys are looking to make to slow that trend? And your thoughts on the ETF flows versus maybe some of the large competitors that showed really pretty remarkable flow trends on the back of some price reductions?","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Yeah, let me start that one, Brennan, and I'll invite Eric to jump in. A two-parter (28:51) question on the institutional outflows this quarter, it kind of continues the trend of mostly passive, largely equity, a little bit of sovereign wealth, but just general repositioning as well as a little bit of currency overlay also affected that institutional outflow. So that's a story that is an ongoing story.","I think probably the better part of the story is the ETF flows, which were $12 billion net in the first quarter and were largely made up of sector funds SPY, which is the S&P 500, and we had good growth from EMEA. And I'd just remind you, a quarter is a quarter. But if you look over the past three quarters, our net flows were $12 billion in the first quarter, $36 billion in the fourth quarter, and $12 billion in the third quarter. So I think trends are important here, and we feel pretty good about the investments that we've made in the ETF franchise, both in product and distribution. And I would suggest that those investments are paying off, and we're seeing that. So we feel pretty good about the ETF positioning.","Do you want to add anything?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yeah, Brennan, I'd just add that from a financial standpoint, the outflows here were in very thin margin passive strategies. I think our overall fee rate in SSGA is about 6 basis points or so. These were a good bit below those. So there's always a bit of question when you have competitive bidding and so forth, as you want to keep low fee, low margin business. And you can imagine we also need to be a little bit disciplined there.","I think the important news is that the inflows that came in with that ETF franchise are above those rates. And so in a way, we had a revenue uptick. And if you want to step back, asset under management \u2013 assets under management in the business were up 4% sequentially, revenue was up 6%. Why? Because we're actually trading up as part of our business expansion here.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Perfect. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, Jay, good morning. Eric, good morning. A question for you guys \u2013 well, Eric, really for you on the balance sheet strategy. So the leverage ratio is in a pretty good place now. The size of the balance sheet came down quite meaningfully sequentially, and I think it kind of jives with your earlier comments that you kind of expect 5-ish percent I think decline for the full year.","So I guess, A, should we take that as the balance sheet should be stable from now on? And, B, as you think about any other repositioning or securities remix (31:47) that you guys are thinking about on the balance sheet side just between the securities portfolio?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Sure. Let me start with the balance sheet side. I think you did see us bring it down consciously. The background there is, as you know, as a company, we began to tackle the size of the balance sheet almost two years ago now. I think we've done quite good work there.","Second half last year, with some of the large inflows that we had disclosed (32:18) on the asset servicing side, those came with deposits, right, and so deposits started to float up. It took the size of our balance sheet up. And what you saw us do is effectively make sure that we digested those, some of those we cap. And then under the surface, you saw us do some optimization, right? We rolled down some of our treasury CD portfolio, that's down over two quarters by about $5 billion, $6 billion. So we're taking out some of the higher cost deposits as we manage and keep the balance sheet tight.","Going forward, I think you're right. I think it's going to be flattish, maybe down a little bit, maybe flat. You never really know with our client inflows and outflows, so I want to be careful there. But I think we're comfortable with the step reduction that we took. And going forward, it will be a little more on the business-as-usual side.","On the securities portfolio, that's exactly right. I think we saw an opportunity. We moved just a few billion out of our $100 billion of securities, and we feel pretty confident where we are, so we don't expect further adjustments in the near future.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then the second question. Jay, I think this one's for you. Just on the $375 billion of new business that's yet to be installed, any (33:45) fees associated with that? Or at least kind of, how does the fee rate on that book of business yet to be installed compares to your sort of overall blended fee rate on the installed business?","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Yes, let me pick that one up, Alex. What I can tell you is that it is a little bit elevated, and it's elevated because the deals that we've been booking the last couple of quarters tend to be meatier, more complex deals, which you can infer from that higher-ish fee rates because it's back office, middle office. And, therefore, the chunkiness causes extended implementation lifecycle. So, I guess that's what I'd say about that.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Morning, folks. Eric, can you just talk about the assumptions that you have for the 4% to 6% fee growth in terms of market returns from, let's say, the end of the first quarter? And also FX volatility, I think that was still getting pressured here in April.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yeah. I think the assumptions are in line with what we disclosed back in January. We're expecting several percentage point increase in underlying equity markets, I think, in line with general economic forecast. FX was kind of at the level of where we were in January. The only large swing we've seen so far is the British pound. So just \u2013 but that's a piece, not a large piece, but obviously a piece of our European revenues. So not a large swing there. So I'd sort of summarize as basic economic assumptions that you or we or others would have out there.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then, just to focus back on the balance sheet. You did mention you're keeping your eye on yield curve flattening. Can you give us a sense of some sensitivity to your 2017 net interest revenue outlook on that?","And then also, if you can talk about the repurchase strategy that I think helped. It looks like to me the repo line was up about $12 million sequentially. I'm not sure if it was all due to that, how recurring do you think that could be? And then, any premium amortization decline in the quarter as well?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","All right. Let me just try to take through those \u2013 all fair questions. The back-end sensitivity, I think the best way to frame it is, we have that interest rate NII disclosure for 100 basis points up\/down in our K. We also have the ramp, but the shock is probably the easiest one to talk through.","If you remember, about 60% of our interest rate sensitivity is in the dollar book, the balance is in Europe. And then, of the dollar book sensitivity impact, the overall \u2013 about 80% of our sensitivity is at the front-end, about 20% at the back-end of the curve.","So, I think it's the front-end rate hikes from the Fed that matter the most. But I think what you will see is, had rates stayed up in the 2.50%, 2.60%, 2.70% (37:15) range in the U.S. and U.S. markets, then that would have created a tailwind of NII for most bank portfolios, just given where they have been purchased at in the last few years.","I think without that, you won't have a natural tailwind and so you can't count on that. And so, it's not a huge mover, but it's the kind of thing that we want to keep an eye on as we estimate and give outlooks on NII.","Repurchase strategy \u2013 oh, the repo. The repo line is just the earnings on the repo book. Some of that \u2013 it's a pretty typical repo book. Some of that includes some repos that are designated under FIN 41 with netting, all that is, I think, well laid out in terms of balances and size in our K in the footnotes. I think it's footnotes 10, 11 or 12. You can find them. But that's recurring earnings, because it's effectively a matchbook of repos and reverses, and so that line will now, as rates have flowed up, will tend to recur.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then premium amortization?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Premium amortization is not significant at this point in our book. I think it was down just slightly, but not enough to call out as a movement of NII or NIM this quarter.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey, good morning. First question, just there's been a lot of chatter on amending the SLR, perhaps removing some of the denominator, central bank cash or other things like that. How much \u2013 I mean, obviously, that would free you up to expand your balance sheet in deposits. Is there a lot of do you think pent-up, I guess, volume out there that you could put on? Because I would think the incremental profitability with no SLR impact could be pretty significant. Just trying to get a sense of what that deposit opportunity could be if they were to alter the SLR.","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Jim, let me start and then I'll let Eric quickly jump in. I think that I agree with your point, which is there is a lot of discussion \u2013 even public discussion. I thought it was notable that when Governor Tarullo gave his ending speech a few weeks ago that he spiked out (39:53) custody bank excess deposit\/SLR issue as something that was probably an unintended consequence. So I probably never felt better about the uniform view that excess deposits (40:11) leverage ratio was unintended and probably should be corrected over time. Not sure when it will be corrected in what form, whether they exclude the excess deposits or whether they ladder (40:24) adjust the leverage ratio. But I think the outlook is pretty good from the standpoint of getting some relief to be determined when and in what form.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yeah. And let me \u2013 it's Eric. Let me just add to the tactical question. For the leverage ratio to be adjusted, there're obviously a number of different scenarios in which that could happen. I mean, we don't know. If it does get relaxed, certainly there is an opportunity to accept more deposits. I think there's certainly a lot of liquidity floating around the system, both here in the U.S. and in Europe. Obviously, the question is at what rate, and so we'd want to be judicious about that.","There's also an ability to lighten our preferred level in the capital stack. We have call options on most of those tranches and so could adjust there. I think what I would point out, though, is certainly there's a question as to whether the rules get \u2013 to get adjusted but also how. Because, remember, the leverage ratio, it affects us as a bank on an SLR basis, right, under the SLR rules, but also the spot current leverage ratio impacts us in terms of CCAR and the CCAR ask. So there're kind of two different parts to the leverage ratio that matter.","And then I'll also remind you just to be careful that if leverage is not a binding constraint for a bank, then at some point, RWA and CET1 is. And so there's a lot of moving parts here that we'd have the consider if there are some changes.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Right. Absolutely. That's why I think deposit growth would probably be the better outcome versus CET1 running up against CET1. And maybe, Jay, a question on middle-office outsourcing outlook, it seems like your mutual fund clients have faced some pressure. Do you see those discussions picking up? And what's your kind of outlook on the pipeline for that since it is a little bit higher margin?","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Yeah, Jim, there is enormous pressure, as has become very visible in the last year or so on the traditional long-only fund companies and so they're doing everything they can to get more efficient. And it has created an uptick \u2013 a significant uptick in not only deal flow, but the complexity of deal flow, meaning the middle-office. Gosh, I would get to at least an half of the mutual fund related activity today that's got a middle-office component.","And even probably, more interestingly, it also has a data component to it. So there's DataGX, which is a fairly new offering for us where we act as the data integrator, taking the middle-office, not only the data that we have but data from other custodians. That product is surging too. So I think it's a natural consequence of more downward pressure on the investment management business generally. And we're in a pretty good place, given the product offering and the things that we're continuing to do, not only to help solve the middle-office issue, but edge our way into the front office with DataGX and other analytics products.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. So you feel good about the pipeline?","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","I do.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Hello. Thank you for taking the question. Eric, you mentioned at the beginning of your remarks efforts to bring GAAP and operating earnings closer together. And clearly, you've made the change around discount accretion. But is there anything else you've done there or anything else you're thinking about doing?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Jeff, it's a good question. We've certainly had a history of the disclosures with GAAP and operating. I think there's some benefit to that, right, because they provide you a sense for the underlying business, especially the big program like Beacon, their restructuring charges that are important to note. I do think, though, that there's investor interest, there's analyst interest, and making sure we're as simple to understand as possible. I met with a number of you down in New York, here in Boston over the last couple of months, and that came through as some of the feedback that I picked up.","So I think you saw us narrow down the number of lines. Discount accretion was all of $5 million, and so to kind of call it out as a separate line, I'd rather just tell you how much it is and incorporated in both results just to make all of our work easier. So I think you saw us take a step change this quarter. I think we'll continue to reevaluate during the course of the year. And, obviously, year-ends are a more natural time to make \u2013 to potentially make some more changes. But I'll be out there listening and seeing if there is some feedback one way or the other, and we'll take it from there.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Hi, Betsy.","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Good morning.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. A couple of questions. One, a bit of a ticky-tacky one just on operating deposits versus non-operating deposits when we're talking about deposit beta highlighting there're some things that are different this time around, that's one of them. And just wanted to understand how far along you are in shrinking the non-operating deposits that you have?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yeah, Betsy, it's Eric. I think part of the optimization that you saw us do over the course of the last quarter is obviously focused on the excess deposits or the non-operating deposits. I think those come in a couple of flavors, right? Some deposits by virtue of coming from financial institutions, and there is a very broad definition under the U.S. and Basel rules, all count as non-operating. I think you saw us a couple years back reduce those amounts, and we want to stay in a comfortable zone because those financial institutions, hedge funds, private equity funds, those are our natural clients we're servicing. And even though those don't count as sticky deposits, we may think they should, but they don't under the rules. We need to accommodate those and we'll continue to do that.","So I think we've made some step changes there a year-and-a-half ago and are comfortable with the level. I think what we find is in the balance of our business, what happens is you have deposits and up to a point, they count as operating. And over that point, when they are above the kind of natural flows that you would expect them to cover, the rules require you to do some calculations or statistical analysis, designate a kind of a level for different types of clients based on their activities and the levels above that tend to be excess. Those are the ones that we've obviously spent more time trying to calibrate and adjust. It's not a science, but that's what we're focused and that's been the effort.","I think, going forward, as I said, I think the balance sheet size is comfortable where it's at. We'd like to keep it flattish from here. I'm an ex-Treasurer. So I always say down a tick just to keep things tight, but we like where we are. We'll always do work, though, under the surface. And so we still have a wholesale CD book in the $8 billion to $9 billion range. If some good client deposits come in, I can bring that down. That would improve NIM because of the interest rate cost differential, and you'll see us take those kinds of actions if we can.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great, Eric. And then just second thing. We talked a little bit about the SLR and the CET1. How do you think about the tangible equity to tangible assets ratio? If you didn't have these other constraints to consider, what do you think a good range is for running the bank on that measure?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","That's a good question, Betsy. And I've not actually spent a lot of time with that historic measure, probably because we have so many measures, whether it's SLR, fully phased-in SLR, we have CET1, we have Tier 1, we have advanced and standardized. And so, to be honest, my perspective is I expect some refinements on the current capital rules, but not so much that we could go back to some of those historic measures like TE to TA. I think that will just be an outgrowth of what the current rules are, to be honest.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. Got it. Okay. Hey, thanks a lot.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Eric, the first question for you. Can we talk a little about other operating costs? Normally, they seem to come down a little bit in the first quarter. Did not see as much of a decline linked quarter, in fact, year on year, and I recognize there is the GE acquisition partly, but it's up very sharply. So could you tell us what's going on with that line and why it's running a little higher than it has previously?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Sure. Other operating expense \u2013 and I think other folks on the call can find it on the supplement or the earnings report, it's up year-on-year really for two reasons. One is the GE sub-advisory fees actually get booked in that line and that was about \u2013 I think about half, a third to half of the uptick. The other is that there is some regulatory and insurance costs, right. There's FDIC, there is some of that equivalent in Europe, and I think there might even been some of those VAT taxes (51:20) and so forth that come through on the expense line.","Quarter-on-quarter, what you did see is a reduction. The quarter-on-quarter reduction is down about 5%. And that was professional fees coming down, some of that is we've in-sourced more of regulatory activities, so you see that in a different line, as an example. But that was down sequentially.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, looking forward, any color on how we should think about that given that that's clearly running on a year-on-year basis much higher, presuming the sub-advisory fees are going to (52:02) regulatory, obviously, down from the fourth quarter, and same with the insurance.?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yeah, I think that's fair. I think you can think of that line as flattish \u2013 within a range. I think there's some volatility. We've got some of our regulatory costs, but those at least \u2013 unless we hear more, right, from some of the supervisors, we expect those to continue, and some of those are good run-the-bank kind of activities. So I think relatively flattish going forward.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","A question for Jay. Jay, there was a comment in the release about hedge fund outflows having some impact. Can you give us an update on where you stand on that? What you're seeing in \u2013 since that's obviously an important client base for you folks, and you've been a leader in that one?","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Sure. Happy to do that, Vivek. As you know, over the past probably 10 years, we have moved into the alternative administration space, both hedge, private equity, and real estate and, in fact, are a leader in that marketplace. And you also are well aware that the hedge fund industry has suffered many sequential quarters of outflows due to performance and other reasons. And so we would reflect some of that movement.","And in the quarter, we continue to see outflows in hedge funds. And I would just suggest that we hope that turns, but we're not fully in control of that. But I'd also mention that that's just one dimension of our servicing complex. I could also point to a few other things, just to provide some balance. The long-only business \u2013 the traditional long-only business in the U.S. actually looked a little bit better. You've seen outflows for a long time. That kind of went to neutral in the past quarter, which we view as constructive. And then, just to give you a couple of other dimensions.","Outside of the U.S., the offshore markets continue to run very fast, and we're the market leader in the offshore services, most of which are centered in Luxembourg and Dublin. And then just final point to that, just to give you kind of the highlights of the big movers. As money has moved out of hedge funds, we've seen it flow into private equity and real estate. And so, we've seen our private equity administration business pick up, and even real estate more recently, as the complexity of doing back-office for real estate assets is overwhelming some of the asset managers.","So I would say I wouldn't focus overtly on just hedge funds. I think it's always a portfolio where some things are in favor, some things are out of favor. And I'd say, for now, hedge funds continue to look to be out of favor, which reflects on our \u2013 that component of our servicing fees.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And where are you on asset management? Since GE seems to have been well absorbed, any color on what you're thinking on that front now, and particularly from an acquisition standpoint?","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Yeah, I would say \u2013 my broad comment about asset management is, we feel we focused our strategy more in ETFs and solutions, and we've been making investments. And I think the performance that you've seen this quarter and the last couple quarters is a reflection of that. So we feel good about the space that we've decided to compete in.","And the GE Asset Management acquisition has exceeded expectations from a standpoint of getting everybody onboard and even having a little bit of \u2013 it's early days, but some uptick in new business. It's given us much more variety in our asset classes in order to fulfill our solutions business. And from an acquisition standpoint, Vivek, I would say there's probably some gaps, smaller gaps in our asset offering that, if we could fill them with a team or a small acquisition, we would entertain, but nothing more significant than that.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Jay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.","Steven Duong - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. This is actually Steve Duong in for Gerard's team. Thanks for taking our questions. Just regarding the BlackRock business that is being transferred to JPMorgan. Are there any deposits with that business? And if so, how much is going?","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Yeah \u2013 go ahead.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Steve, it's Eric. There's a bit of deposits with every client that we have, and we'll certainly factor that in, and that's factored in our view of this year and next year.","I will say, though, there are more deposits that tend to come our way than go. Our treasurer and our businesses do quite a bit of balancing between price and just active discussions with our servicing counterparties about how much they can leave with us. And so, if a little deposits flow out, let me tell you, there'll be other clients who want to leave deposits with us in a pretty simple exchange.","Steven Duong - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood. Thank you. And just a second question regarding your dividend. What are you guys thinking about, just as far as a long-term dividend payout? Is something like a 40% fair?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Steve, it's Eric. I think that's a good question, and I'd kind of answer it in two ways. I think we're comfortable with the current level of dividends versus buyback. It gives us a good amount of flexibility in terms of the capital structure. We like the opportunity to have the mix that we have. And, obviously, that's all part of our CCAR ask that we submitted back in April.","I think I'd also say that, as said has (58:50) become clear, that there isn't really a 30% dividend cap as a way to return capital to shareholders, we'll consider over time whether we want to make some adjustments, but that will be something we consider. But no, no new news to report at this point.","Steven Duong - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks for taking our questions.","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","Yes.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. So just two quick questions really. You did mention on the new business yet to be installed that was coming in with higher fee rates than what you currently see across the company. Is that also the same for the BlackRock business that's going away? Is that a higher fee rate business as well?","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Yeah. Let me just clarify that, Brian. What I described is that it's a higher \u2013 the $375 billion is a higher level of backlog to be installed than we have traditionally had. And connected to that, I mentioned that the reason for that is that they're bigger, meatier, more complex deals, therefore, they have a longer implementation timeframe. You can infer from that that there's more middle-office and complexity and so a higher fee rate. The BlackRock business is kind of standard kind of 1940 Act-ish straightforward common trust fund business, so a little simpler.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And then, was there any impact from the run rates from the sale of the BFDS business?","Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.","There was not in this quarter. It's Eric. Brian, there's not in this quarter just because it was done at the end of the quarter. There'll be a small one, but it's fairly minor in the scheme of our revenues and certainly incorporated in our fee and revenue guidance that we've provided.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing remarks.","Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.","Thanks, Hope. And I just want to thank everybody for their participation today and we look forward to speaking with you in July with the second quarter results. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
