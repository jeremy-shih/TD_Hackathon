Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call July 20, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman and CEO","Andrew Clarke - CFO","Timothy Gagnon - Director of IR","Analysts","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson Second Quarter 2017 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, Tim Gagnon will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, July 20, 2017.","I will now turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, the Director of Investor Relations.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everybody. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Clarke, the Chief Financial Officer. John and Andy will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our second quarter results. We'll follow that with a response to the pre-submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday.","Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate the discussion. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our Web site which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Andy will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments.","I'd like to remind you that comments made by John, Andy or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","With that, I'll turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments on Slide 3 with a review of our second quarter results.","John P. Wiehoff","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. It was a challenging second quarter. We were able to continue to grow our volumes and achieve market share gains but our income and EPS results were disappointing and it finished below our expectations.","Our results were significantly impacted by truckload margin compression as the North American truckload market transitioned from being relatively balanced to fairly tight driving purchased transportation costs up more than we expected in the quarter.","Much of our customer pricing is committed and changes over longer periods of time. The margin compression in the North American market impacted our NAST and Robinson Fresh truckload businesses, and you\u2019ll see that impact in the segment results.","We have a strong history of honoring our customer contracts while adjusting to the market and I\u2019m confident that we will adapt and execute in the months to come. We continue to execute against our long-term strategic initiatives to grow and diversify our business.","The Global Forwarding business delivered strong results in the second quarter with both double-digit net revenue and operating income growth. Managed Services also had another strong growth quarter.","Total revenues increased 12.4% in the second quarter driven by volume growth of 10% in our transportation services. Total company net revenues declined 3.4% in the quarter. The addition of APC Logistics accounted for approximately 2% of the total net revenue in the quarter.","Income from operations was 182 million, a decrease of 22% and net income was also down 22%. We had diluted earnings per share of $0.78 in the second quarter compared to $1.00 last year.","Our average headcount was up 8% in the quarter. The addition of APC added approximately 2% to the average headcount. After Andy goes through the financial deck, I\u2019ll provide some thoughts on how we\u2019re managing the business and approaching the back half of the year and beyond.","So with that, let me turn it over to Andy.","Andrew Clarke","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John mentioned, it was a challenging quarter for both income and earnings. We did grow top line, however, across the organization by taking market share but it didn\u2019t translate into the results that we expect of ourselves.","As I run through the numbers for the enterprise and the reportable segments, I will provide greater details on the results and how we are adapting to current market conditions, especially in the North American market.","There are some positives in our results and we would be remiss if we didn\u2019t recognize the efforts and the results of our Global Forwarding and Managed Services teams. So let me start with the summarized income statement on Slide 4.","Operating expenses were $392 million in the quarter, an 8.7% increase versus last year. Personnel expenses increased just over 5% in the quarter primarily as the result of the 8% headcount increase.","Approximately 30% of the headcount, as John mentioned, was the result of the APC acquisition. The remaining additions were across the various business units and shared services teams.","Cash compensation for Robinson grew in line with headcount while variable compensation, including profit sharing and stock vesting decreased versus last year.","SG&A expenses increased 19.4% to nearly 108 million in the second quarter. Claims were $8 million in the quarter, which is up nearly $6 million versus last year. We had a few contingent auto liability claims that we settled in the quarter that made up the majority of the increase.","Acquisition amortization was up nearly $3 million as a result of the APC acquisition and allowance for doubtful accounts, warehouse expense and purchased services were up nearly $2 million each.","As we move into the second half of the year and look to 2018, our entire organization are evaluating expenses and headcount. We are balancing our growth initiatives with our efficiency and cost control priorities.","You will also notice on our full income statement a $2.5 million increase in interest expense. Our debt balance is up versus last year and the interest rate on the short-term portion of that debt increased from 1.5% last year to 2.1% this year.","For the quarter, our operating income as a percent of net revenues decreased to 31.7% compared to 39.3% in last year\u2019s second quarter. The effective tax rate during the quarter was 35.6% versus 37.1% last year.","For the remaining quarters in 2017, we expect a tax rate between 36% and 37%. This rate will fluctuate based on the value of the shares as well as the percentage of pre-tax profits generated outside the United States. During the second quarter of this year, we generated nearly 20% of our income outside of the United States.","Moving on to Slide 5 and other financial information. We generated nearly $60 million in cash in the quarter and had $16 million in capital expenditures. The largest drivers of the decrease in cash flow from operations was the increase in accounts receivable during the quarter. This occurrence is normal and expected during periods of accelerating top line growth.","The other driver of the decrease relates to the timing of our federal tax payment. We finished the quarter with $273 million in cash and our debt balance is just over $1.3 billion. For the entire year 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million, the majority of which relates to continued investments in IT.","On to Slide 6 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $106 million to shareholders in the quarter with just over $64 million in dividends and approximately $42 million in share repurchases. In the quarter, we returned nearly 96% of our net income to shareholders in line with our stated annual objective and year-to-date that number sits at 94%.","Moving on to Slide 7 and net revenue by service. As a reminder, this slide represents the services revenue for all of our business units. We have historically provided this view on the services revenue but rather than review this slide separately, I will make comments about the various services within the business segment.","On Slide 8, the light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in North American truckload rate and cost per mile to customers and carriers that have fueled costs since 2008. The gray line is the net revenue margin for all transportation services.","In this year\u2019s second quarter, the North American truckload rate per mile net of fuel was flat versus last year\u2019s second quarter, while cost per mile increased 4%. While customer pricing was flat overall, the contractual pricing was down and transactional pricing was up during the quarter.","Purchase transportation costs increased 4%. This was the result of the tightening capacity in the marketplace on a year-over-year basis and that increased during the quarter. June had the largest year-over-year increase, up 6% versus last year.","Starting with road check early in the month and carrying through the July 4th Holiday, we saw things really tighten up with costs rising more than we have seen in some period of time. Our pricing did increase as a result of the cost increase but there was a lag effect.","We continue to access the market and the increased pricing environment and would share that into July we are still seeing higher purchased transportation costs versus the same time last year.","Slide 9 and our transportation results. Total transportation revenues for all segments were up 15.2% to $3.3 billion in the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this is a result of our strong volume growth of 10% across all of our services in the second quarter.","Transportation net revenue margins decreased to 16.2%, down from last year\u2019s second quarter of 19.3%. We experienced lower margins in most of our transportation services with the North American truckload margin compression having the greatest impact. I\u2019ll go into greater detail in each of the business units.","Now to Slide 10 and the reportable segments. Before getting into the NAST numbers, I\u2019d like to first comment on the NAST organization. We are the number one truckload broker and we are the number one LTL broker in North America by a wide margin.","We\u2019ve been in the game longer and we have more experience than anyone out there. While the results are challenging and our execution not perfect, we have the leadership team and the strategy and the people out in the field to weather and succeed in the long run.","In the North American Surface Transportation segment, total revenues increased over 10% to approximately $2.4 billion in the second quarter. Volume across NAST services increased nearly 8% in the quarter. NAST net revenues decreased 9.8% to $360 million in the quarter.","NAST revenue margin was 15.1% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter of 18.5%. The lower margins were primarily the result of increased purchase transportation costs in both the truckload and LTL service lines. NAST operating expenses increased slightly 1.5%. The increase was due to SG&A expenses, which is partially offset by a decrease in personnel expenses at the divisional level.","Income from operations were down 23.2% to $140 million. NAST operating margins were 39% in the quarter, down from 45.8% last year. And employee count was 7,003, up slightly from the previous quarter.","Now to Slide 11 and the results by service within NAST. As I mentioned, NAST truckload net revenues were down $41 million or 14.1%. The margin compression within the contractual truckload business is representative of the risk we take when we enter into longer term price and volume commitments with our customers.","As a reminder, most of our contracts are one year in length and the contracts are executed at varying times throughout the year based on customer terms. We did not expect transportation costs to rise at the level they did in the second quarter and we are reacting to the changes as quickly as we can.","There are initiatives underway to appropriately adapt to this market by making sure we honor our commitment levels while also adjusting pricing in our transactional and backup business. Truckload volume was up 8% in the second quarter and we continue to outpace the overall market volume growth during the quarter.","We achieved volume growth in both short and long-haul shipments. We added 3,700 new carriers in the second quarter compared to approximately 4,400 in last year\u2019s second quarter. These new carriers moved approximately 18,000 shipments for us during the quarter.","LTL net revenues increased 2.1% to nearly $100 million. Volumes increased 6.5% when compared to the second quarter of last year and purchase transportation costs increased during the quarter putting slight pressure on margins.","Intermodal net revenues decreased 6.3% in the quarter with volumes up 15.5%. Over the past several quarters we\u2019ve been growing the contractual business albeit at lower margins while transactional volumes are down quite a bit from last year\u2019s second quarter. This is obviously a result of depressed truckload pricing market environment.","And now on to Slide 12 and results for our Global Forwarding segment. As previously, I\u2019d like to comment on the Global Forwarding team prior to getting into the results which were fantastic. Our Global Forwarding team has been building momentum for some time and have done very well in executing against their growth plans.","We\u2019ve been the number one NVO from China to the U.S. for some time and in this past quarter, however, we elevated our ranking in all of Asia to the number one NVO from Asia to the United States. Congratulations to the team for these great results.","The APC integration has gone incredibly well and we are generating great returns in the short time since partnering with them. Total revenues for the Global Forwarding segment in the second quarter were $529 million, up 48.2% versus last year.","Second quarter net revenues were 121 million, a 24.5% increase from 2016. We had strong organic growth of over 12% and APC contributed to the success in Global Forwarding adding approximately 12% as well.","Net revenue margin was 22.9%, down from 27.3% last year. Margin compression in the quarter is the result of the combination of overall industry trends as well as the incredibly strong volume growth in market share gains.","Income from operations was up 23.6% to nearly $28 million and operating margin was 22.9% in the quarter. Headcount increased over 14% in the quarter with APC representing just over 300 or approximately 9% of the additional employees in the business.","Slide 13 will cover our Global Forwarding service lines. Ocean net revenues were up 22%, 10% of which was organic growth in the quarter. APC contributed approximately 12% to our ocean net revenue growth. Ocean shipments increased approximately 22% in the quarter and pricing was up in the ocean service line. The margin compression in this area was primarily in our contractual business.","Air net revenues increased 31% with even stronger organic growth of 20% plus. APC contributed approximately 11% to the growth. Air shipments increased during the quarter approximately 32% and price per air shipment was up for the first time in some time in the second quarter. The team has executed well in their stated strategy of growing air freight and gateway consolidations.","Customs net revenue increased nearly 41% with APC contributing approximately 24% to that growth. Customs transactions increased approximately 34% in the second quarter. These results were a nice bounce back for both net revenue and operating income. Year-to-date net revenues are up 19.7% with organic Global Forwarding net revenues just short of 7%.","Transitioning to our Robinson Fresh business on Slide 14. Now to Robinson Fresh which is our global logistics and product division that is focused on fresh temperature control supply chains.","With our new segment reporting, we now share results inclusive of revenues from sourcing and transportation services whereas previously we only reported sourcing revenue and rolled sourcing transportation up into consolidated transportation reporting.","Like NAST, while our Robinson Fresh results are not where we want them to be, this team has been in the business a very long time. It\u2019s how we got started and we have the leaders in the people to adapt to drive better results.","Robinson Fresh total revenues were $657 million, a decrease slightly of 0.5% in the second quarter. Net revenues were down 10% last year to $61 million. Robinson Fresh operating expenses increased 15% in the second quarter. The increase was primarily due, as I mentioned earlier, to the SG&A expenses which was driven by a contingent auto liability claim of nearly $4 million.","The Robinson Fresh operating expenses were also impacted by new warehouse facilities and increases in technology spending. Income from operations were $14.2 million in the quarter. And finally Robinson Fresh average headcount increased 3.5% in the quarter.","On Slide 15, Robinson Fresh sourcing total revenue declined 6.7%. The decrease in total revenue was a result of lower market pricing, down approximately 7% per case sold. Sourcing net revenues were down nearly 7% in the second quarter as case volume was flat on a year-over-year basis. The primary reason for the decrease in sourcing net revenue was the result of a decline in product margins and the loss of a customer.","Moving on to Slide 16 and the Robinson Fresh transportation business. Robinson Fresh transportation total revenues increased 10.3% in the second quarter of 2017, driven by volume growth of 15%.","Robinson Fresh transportation net revenue decreased 14.6% in the second quarter of 2017 due primarily to truckload net revenue declining 19.8% in the quarter. We continue to see strong volume growth in the Robinson Fresh transportation business with a 15% year-over-year increase.","The Robinson Fresh truckload business has a similar share of contractual business as the NAST truckload business and the initiatives I talked about earlier are priorities for the Robinson Fresh team as well.","Moving on to all other and corporate on Slide 17. All other includes our Managed Services business as well as Surface Transportation outside of North America and other miscellaneous revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses.","Headcount was up 15.7% and this was primarily the result of personnel increases in technology, other enterprise resources, European Surface Transportation and Managed Services.","Net revenue for the other category increased 6.8% in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 led by the continued strong performance in our Managed Services which is partially offset by a decrease in net revenues in the European Surface Transportation business.","TMC or Managed Services organization continues to perform well. We are leading and managing some of the most complex global supply chains for some of the most recognized technology and manufacturing companies in the world.","Freight under management continues to increase and we are on pace to approach $4 billion by the end of the year. As an organization, we are approaching $7 billion in freight under management.","Managed Services net revenue increased 15.1% in the second quarter of 2017 to 18.2 million compared to 15.8 million in the second quarter of 2016. This increase was a result of net business as well as increased business with existing customers. The Managed Services team continues to deliver strong results and we feel good about our ability to continue to grow net revenue double digits.","Other Surface Transportation net revenues decreased 2.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to just under $14 million compared to which was flat versus last year. The decrease was primarily the result of truckload margin compression in Europe. Similar to North America, the European business has a high percent of contractual commitments. Our team in Europe has done a great job as well to grow volumes and take market share.","And with that, I thank you all for joining us this morning. I\u2019m going to turn it back over to John for some closing comments before we answer your questions.","John P. Wiehoff","Thank you, Andy. So moving to Slide 19. Consistent with past periods, I\u2019ll start our final comments with some key performance metrics from the current month. July to-date, total company net revenue has increased approximately 2% compared to July of 2016.","Truckload volume growth has slowed from the second quarter. The holiday timing makes precise comparisons difficult this early in the month but truckload volume growth has been in the low single digits.","Our primary focus in truckload services is adapting to market conditions and I\u2019d like to expand on what we mean by that. As a reminder, our approach to account management is very customized by size segment, vertical and specific business needs.","We have a variety of customer commitments and unique contracts with thousands of our customers. We think that\u2019s a big part of our competitive advantage in the marketplace and allows better customer service.","When we experienced a significant shift in the market conditions, we do a number of things to react. All of them are guided by the overall principle of honoring our commitments and providing great customer service.","Our reactions include things like; clarifying committed and transactional activity, reviewing tender acceptances and turndowns, discussing route guide compliance and where customers might be experiencing service failures, evaluating activity by lane, looking for alterative routing solutions and making price adjustments where appropriate.","Our goal in this part of the truckload cycle is to provide great service, honor our commitments and adjust to optimum routing and pricing for our customers. We commit significant resources to these account management practices and believe in customized solutions.","While there\u2019s always some level of market adjustment occurring, we are several weeks into more active assessments. Our results in early July reflect some of the outcomes from those adjustments.","Beyond adapting to the changes in the truckload market conditions, I also want to share some thoughts on how we\u2019re managing our network and the related costs. Part of our core business model and strategy is to have significant pay-for-performance and variable costs in our network.","We remain committed to those principles and believe that our net revenue growth and network costs will be more aligned longer term than they are this year. Our additional segment reporting information this year should help to understand the changes in our mix and where we are investing our capital.","At our Investor Day in May, we shared an overview of how we\u2019re transforming our operational network and investing in technology and digital processes. We continue to feel very confident about our progress on those initiatives and the related efficiencies and productivity that we\u2019re already seeing.","As a reminder, we did increase our truckload volume this quarter by 8.5% while adding 3% headcount to NAST. We\u2019re investing in automating our service offerings and changing our network to leverage scale and expand our service offerings.","While we believe we can improve our financial results for the remainder of 2017, we also do expect to continue increased technology investments that are more fixed costs. Over the longer term, we believe we\u2019ll have a more automated and scaled network that will allow us to leverage those fixed costs for improved efficiency.","During this network transition, we will be aggressively managing our other discretionary expenses and continuing to invest in sales and account management throughout the business. We\u2019re committed to maintaining our leadership position in truckload services while growing and diversifying our business through this network transformation.","That ends our prepared comments, and I\u2019ll turn it back over to Tim to facilitate our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Mr. Gagnon, the floor is yours for the Q&A session.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, Donna. Thank you to all the analysts and investors that shared their questions with us last evening. We have a lot of great questions and we\u2019ll get right to them here this morning.","I\u2019ll start off the Q&A with Andy and our first question is, please provide context to the increases in claims expenses this quarter? Are they expected to be one-time or occurring? Do you expect increases in premiums, et cetera?","Andrew Clarke","Yes, a little backdrop on the actual insurance. So we own the retention on the first $5 million. So any claim or contingent auto liability that occurs, we own the first 5 million of it. As far as the premiums, we\u2019ve been able to keep those flat in our annual renewals. So we\u2019re buying insurance better and keeping the amount that we pay for the premiums down. So in this quarter, we had three incidents that were settled during the quarter. These are incidents that go back several years. But they finally made it to the point where we were able to settle them for a total of $6 million.","As a point of reference, last quarter we didn\u2019t have any contingent auto liabilities that went against us and in fact we had a legal claim that we settled positively for us. So there is variability in that number and because of the level of variability, it really is hard to predict. And because it\u2019s hard to predict, the accountants will not let you setup a general reserve for them. So while we\u2019ve done a good job we think of managing those claims and we move millions of shipments a year, in other words something does happen and in a quarter like this, we settled three of them.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. Next question to John. Could you please elaborate on the increased focus on cost controls and SG&A expenses? What expenses categories you see opportunities? And how do you think about the rate of headcount growth going forward?","John P. Wiehoff","So I started to address this in the tail end of the prepared comments but I\u2019ll go a little bit deeper into it. From our cost control standpoint, we do look at personnel and non-personnel costs somewhat separately. They\u2019re obviously related but managed differently. There are some other questions that are more specific to the non-personnel SG&A that are directed to Andy that are coming up, so I\u2019ll leave that to come. But obviously there\u2019s opportunities in that category. The more significant operating expense is the personnel side of it.","And in my prepared comments we talked about the implementation of segment reporting and as we grow and diversify why it\u2019s important to look at where we\u2019re adding those heads and how our business is growing and changing, we obviously have the acquired personnel from the APC acquisition as well as organic hiring and growth in Global Forwarding, all accumulating in results that we want to sustain along the business plan there. The growth in Managed Services, again there\u2019s headcount additions in there and I commented about the headcount additions in the technology space where we are making some specific projects and some specific investments that we want or need to continue going forward to finish with over the next year or two.","We have had a long-term growth expectation of adding people to our team at a pace slower than the volume growth that we\u2019ve incurred. And we\u2019ve been successful with that over the long end and we\u2019ve been more successful with it the last couple of years. We obviously have to balance whatever cyclicality or secular changes are going on and make sure that we balance our overall business model or net revenue and personnel growth. So we will continue that.","If our volume continues to taper off, we will see decreased hiring in the areas where we are driving hiring relative to volume. We already do see tapering off in some of our divisions where that occurs. So we adjust that fairly quickly. There are some fixed costs associated with adding to our team. And just like truckload pricing, it can take a quarter or two to cycle through. So we do expect the headcount growth to level off or even go down with attrition in some of the divisions through the remainder of the year. And we\u2019ll get the personnel costs in line over the long term like we always have.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. And the next question, Andy, on SG&A expenses. You noted higher bad debt and warehouse expenses in the second quarter which negatively impacted G&A expenses. Can you quantify those and help us think about a normalized G&A run rate going forward given the volatility in that line over the last several quarters?","Andrew Clarke","Yes, that allowance for doubtful account was different than bad debt. We had very low actual bad debt experience during the quarter and year-to-date. But the way the accounting works for that particular number, it\u2019s up $2 million versus last year. But remember, Q2 of '16 was down 2 million \u2013 approximately $2 million from Q2 of '15. So it\u2019s a formula driven by the amount of receivables that you have. And if you think about our 12.5% top line growth, clearly that means that we\u2019re going to have more revenue and therefore more receivables from our customers. And the formula is driven by the amount of receivables that you have as well as the amount that\u2019s beyond 60 days.","So in a period where as I mentioned in my prepared remarks where revenue is growing, you\u2019re going to continue to see not only receivables increase but certainly that allowance receipt. So that\u2019s that particular part of it. We\u2019ve talked about the warehouse expense being up $2 million and that\u2019s primarily in the Robinson Fresh division although there\u2019s a little bit in the NAST division. But that will lap and normalize at the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth quarter. There\u2019s another expense that\u2019s in there that will lap at the end of the third quarter, which is the $3 million of amortization expense from the APC acquisition.","So if you take all of those up and including the one that I mentioned in my previous answer, which is the $6 million of claims, you got the $2 million of the allowance for doubtful accounts, you got the $2 million for the warehouse, you got $3 million in amortization; that\u2019s $13 million that to a degree is driving a lot of the variability of the 107. So when we think about more normalized rate, we certainly believe that there is areas that we are going to continue to focus on and continue to drive better results. As John and I both mentioned; John in his answers, me in my prepared remarks, clearly our objective is to drive down the SG&A costs both as a percent of revenue but also as a percent of the personnel.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. Next question to John on pricing. What percentage of your truckload brokerage business was exposed to contract pricing? How does that compare to second quarter 2016 levels? Do you not anticipate the tightening of \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, did you not anticipate the tightening of supply and demand that was experienced in May and June? Are you now inclined to ratchet down the percentage of contract business exposure going forward?","John P. Wiehoff","So the answer to the first part of the question is that our committed truckload pricing was about two-thirds or 65% is our best estimate of the business that happened during the second quarter of this year. That is fairly consistent with the second quarter of last year but I think the important point there is that if you\u2019re to go back a long time, 15 to 20 years ago, that was single digits or closer to zero. So the longer term trend in our business has been a steady increase of more mix of committed and contractual freight as we\u2019ve grown with large customers and as we\u2019ve expanded our service offering more into core lanes and core committed services with those largest customers.","So in terms of where we see this headed and do we want to ratchet down the percentage of that contractual business, whenever we go through a market adjustment like we are now, there is some natural attrition of those committed prices where when we do have to raise that certain customers won\u2019t renew. When the market moves this aggressively, there will naturally be more spot market opportunities. So it is not a steady liner increase of committed activity. It does cycle up and down and we would expect to likely see some increase as the entire market perhaps moves more transactional that our mix of business will as well too.","From a long-term trend though, we do not have goals to drive that down. The best estimates are probably that 80% of the overall market is committed and we do feel that it\u2019s served us well in the long run and it is an important capability that we have to participate in that committed freight. And as I said in my prepared comments, it\u2019s a big part of our service advantage in the marketplace to be able to understand all the nuances and work with both types of freights with our customers. Overall, I would say our goal is to continue to use technology and information and process improvement to better manage the relationship between the committed and the transactional freight and make sure that we\u2019re doing the best we can to be successful on both parts of it.","With regards to the question of did we not anticipate the tightening of the supply and demand, if you look at the chart on Slide 8 where Andy covered the pricing; while our pricing was flat year-over-year that was actually quite an improvement of declined pricing in previous years. So there certainly was an expectation of increased costs as the year would progress. But it\u2019s not just us. I think the market consensus as a whole was looking towards the end of the year and into 2018 for a meaningful increase in cost and it has started early. So while we did anticipate the trend that was happening, as we\u2019ve acknowledged it was greater than we expected and did spike up more than anticipated in our contract negotiations during the months of May and June.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question, Andy, on personnel. Why was personnel expense so high as a percentage of net revenue per employee typically that as more variable?","Andrew Clarke","Yes, personnel expenses are up as a number because its headcount is up. So personnel expenses are up 5.5% and headcount\u2019s up 8%. The cash compensation per person is flat on a year-over-year basis but broadly speaking performance-based compensation including equity, including profit sharing is down double digits versus last year. So the average headcount \u2013 total compensation per person is down 3% when you factor those two in. And so when you have top line margin compression that we saw particularly in North American truckload but in all of our businesses, it will negatively impact that ratio.","I\u2019d also like to maybe dovetail onto what John just mentioned in terms of personnel and address that. I think the ATA came out yesterday, the day before, and talked about how they anticipate truckload volumes to grow at 3.5% per year until 2023. And if you just do kind of assuming which by the way we\u2019re not assuming, assuming we don\u2019t take any market share, if you just use that figure and you extrapolate it out, that\u2019s well over 1 million additional loads that we would be doing in the outer years. And so we, as a senior leadership team, particularly a NAST organization, Robison Fresh in that area, think about how do we continue to grow for the long term.","And part of that which we\u2019ve done is invest through cycles, invest for good cycles, invest for challenging cycles when it comes to thinking about the long-term strategic plan and strategic priorities for the organization. So we just want to make sure that we communicated effectively to people on this phone and obviously to people in our organization to let them know that we\u2019re thinking about things in the short term and making the adjustments that we need to make. But there\u2019s also a long-term gain that\u2019s out there.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. Next question to John also on personnel. You\u2019ve been steadfast in your strategy to higher employees to support future growth. Are employee hiring plans expected to be tempered given the second quarter of 2017\u2019s net revenue contraction?","John P. Wiehoff","As I stated earlier, the headline answer to that is yes. However, one of the things I do want to clarify is that we are very well aware of how the world is changing and the impact of technology and the fact that more and more in almost every industry you cannot just throw bodies at things to solve problems.","The thing that we try to emphasize and differentiate is that while there\u2019s a lot of automation and change in our industry, we do have 4% or 5% of our freight that is completely automated and we\u2019re investing to try to drive up and increase the digital processes across all of our freight. But at the same time we believe in account management.","We believe in the value that our people can add. Our customers tell us that all the time. We know that a lot of our gains and a lot of opportunity to continue to grow in the marketplace is driven by having what we think are the best people in the industry. So we want to make sure that we combine our belief in sales and account management with everything that we can do to automate and improve our processes and leverage our productivity in the future.","And the last part around that is because we do have a heavy balance of proprietary technology, even our investments in that area show up in the personnel line more so than the SG&A line item because we are building a lot of our own code. So we are managing and adjusting to how our industry is changing and how the marketplace is changing and we do have a commitment to our employees that we think they are a key part of our success and will be in the future as well too. But we\u2019re also focused on leveraging technology and productivity gains for the future.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question to Andy on competition. Was any margin pressure a function of extra brokerage capacity brought into the market by Uber, Amazon or any of the other venture capital funded start-ups?","Andrew Clarke","I would I guess maybe answer that question by clearly the margin pressure that we are experiencing and quite frankly everybody is experiencing is brought on by a challenging pricing environment and increased competition broadly speaking. I\u2019m not sure in terms of the question of the extra brokerage capacity and how that relates. But there certainly is \u2013 in environments like this, people tend to obviously react as we\u2019ve done it and become very competitive in the marketplace. And so we\u2019re reacting as we need to in that area.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. Next question to John. Can you please discuss net revenue growth excluding APC Logistics July to-date, year-over-year?","John P. Wiehoff","So I\u2019ve talked about this in the prepared comments a little bit but I\u2019ll clarify a little bit further. So July to-date, net total company net revenue we\u2019re up 2%. We have shared and been consistent that the acquisition of APC has contributed about 2%. The APC acquisition closed right around October 1st or the beginning of the fourth quarter. So there is one more quarter.","And including these early results in July, we are getting a little bit of tailwind from the APC acquisition that would show up in the Global Forwarding segment. The changes that I discussed around adapting to the market are driven towards the truckload services in both NAST and Fresh. So really when you look at our second quarter results of total company net revenue being down 4 versus the plus 2% for the early July, virtually all of that changes in the truckload services net revenue for the first couple of weeks of July.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question to Andy. Global Forwarding organic net revenue growth of roughly 12% year-over-year, any specific verticals, regions or other sources of this growth does it reflect share gains or underlying market improvement?","Andrew Clarke","Well, clearly the market is up a little bit as others have reported but we\u2019re also taking market share in our Global Forwarding operations. As I\u2019ve mentioned in our prepared remarks, the team has done a wonderful job across the board, its ocean, its air, its customs. As it relates to trade lanes, again I mentioned that we\u2019re now the number one NVO from all of Asia to the United States whereas previously we were the number one NVO from China. And so as we\u2019ve expanded over the last several years into more southern Asia, our team has done a great job here and there to grow the volumes and grow the net revenues in that trade lane.","And I would offer that the opportunity that APC has brought is also helping us drive organic growth, because we do have more of a presence and now business that we had not seen from Asia and from Europe to Australia and reverse are the results of that acquisition. So there\u2019s really good organic growth in terms of industry verticals. And by the way, our freight\u2019s all over as well with a large portion of it coming from Asia to the United States, as I mentioned, our gateway consolidations. As far as verticals, again I think our team has done a great job of diversifying across many different verticals and being able to provide solutions for those customers. The one that I would highlight is the efforts that we\u2019ve had around the semiconductor industry.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. John, given your tenure and expertise in transportation, how would you characterize the current freight environment? We have heard that the market tightened significantly during June and that seems to be supported by spot rate data. Would you characterize this as a strong seasonal uptick or do you believe we are on the cusp of a recovery in the freight market after a challenging prior 18 months?","John P. Wiehoff","Given the earlier comments that I\u2019ve already discussed around how we are adapting to the market changes, we do believe that there is more than just a seasonal uptick and that this is reflective of a trend and that\u2019s why we are adapting to the market and making some of the changes that we are. Thinking about kind of where we\u2019re at \u2013 overall, where are we at in the market, several years ago we added Slide 8 to our presentation deck and again Andy\u2019s made some comments on it.","But I would like to refer everybody back to that for just a moment, the slide that has the two blue lines on it that shows our average cost of price to customers as well as our average cost of hire and then what that does to our net revenue margins. Obviously, majority of the questions this quarter are around this. How could this happen? Didn\u2019t you anticipate it? Where\u2019s it going to go? And those are all fair questions.","When you look at Slide 8 and you look back over the last decade around how our business has evolved, how our pricing has evolved and start thinking about what does this quarter mean, where do we go from here? I do think studying that is very helpful and probably is what I or most of us would look at in terms of kind of making the decision around adjusting to the market conditions and thinking about what the remainder of the year or next year is likely to look at.","When you look at the last decade through this pricing, you see those lines go all over the place. They\u2019re up double digits at times and down high single digits at times during that 10-year period. Lots of data points and ours would suggest that over time, there\u2019s an average 2% to 3% increase in the cost of hire and the cost to the customer side of it. You can see on that chart that we\u2019re coming off 18 to 24 months of down pricing. You can also see on that slide how we do adjust. Those two lines will stay closer together. And over the last year, year and a half, they\u2019ve been coming from meaningful declines and moving upward.","And again, this is our average of both committed and transactional activity. So there\u2019s probably more volatility in the transactional stuff as Andy said in his early comments. It\u2019s always hard when you look backwards because history becomes obvious. But when you look at what\u2019s been going on for the last couple of quarters, there has been some pretty meaningful upward trends around price reductions that likely weren\u2019t sustainable.","This industry has always had some cost increases and while we\u2019re all working hard on productivity, there\u2019s also some long-term drivers of increased cost in the price of the equipment, some regulatory changes that are reducing productivity. So when you look at it now and you see the head fake [ph] in late 2017 of both of those going down for a quarter and then you see for two quarters in a row now the resumption of some pretty significant upward trends, we do believe that\u2019s more than a seasonal uptick and it makes sense in the longer term perspective of things that it\u2019s going to have to be positive for a while.","We\u2019ve also talked in the past around when you look in aggregate at this chart, there\u2019s clearly more volatility than what we would have experienced in decades prior to that. Some of that may be brought on by our evolution to more committed freight that we\u2019ve talked about earlier but I think on the industry as a whole, as people are looking at more data and managing processes more tightly, I think it\u2019s a normal conclusion that markets tend to get more volatile when they\u2019re automated and managed more tightly and there\u2019s less slack in them.","So will it go all the way up to a double digit increase in the next year or two, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s happened twice on this chart. It could happen again. Probably has a relationship of what the overall demand of freight and the overall economic conditions do in the next year or two as well. Those are the thoughts I would share with regards to that question.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. The next question for Andy and it\u2019s going to be a couple of parts here. Can you give us a sense of the monthly net revenue growth progression through the second quarter of 2016 and then also the net revenue growth per day in the third quarter of 2016 by month, and then also the monthly net revenue trend during the second quarter of 2017?","Andrew Clarke","Yes, so I\u2019ll bracket into \u2013 just to do the Q2 numbers both '16 and '17. So the second quarter of '16 went April was up 9%, May was flat and June was down 3%. So that\u2019s Q2 of '16. Q2 of '17 was minus 3, minus 5 and minus 3. As we look at the Q3 of 2016, so the comp that we\u2019re coming up against, July was minus 3, August was minus 7 and September was minus 5.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. And just a reminder, those are all per business day percent changes. The next question for John on intermodal. What contributed to accelerate \u2013 the acceleration in the rate of intermodal volume growth?","John P. Wiehoff","I believe we\u2019ve talked about this in the past couple of quarters where we\u2019ve started to see some growth in our intermodal volume. Historically, we have been more of a transactional intermodal provider where we\u2019ve worked across our customers to try to find opportunities where we could apply intermodal when the market conditions were suited to that.","As truckload pricing has softened and as the intermodal world has changed, we\u2019ve moved more towards bigger, more committed or permanent intermodal shipping customers and we have had some wins in that area. So as Andy stated, it\u2019s sometimes coming at lesser margins than historical spot market intermodal activity but we do feel good about the direction that we\u2019re headed with regards to bigger wins and more volume increases in our intermodal capabilities.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. With Europe\u2019s economy rebounding nicely, are you finding increased demand for your services on the continent?","Andrew Clarke","We are. Our volume\u2019s up in Europe 10% versus last year, so again the team\u2019s done a great job of going in there and getting more committed in contractual business with our customers just like in North America. There\u2019s a bit of margin compression but they\u2019ve done a wonderful job of growing with some e-commerce as well as some new retail accounts that we have over there.","Timothy Gagnon","Okay. Thanks, Andy. Next question for John again on the topic of contractual and transactional truckload business. Did you change to more contractual versus variable on relationships with customers or is the ratio in line with historical comps?","John P. Wiehoff","I did address this earlier. Here it\u2019s probably worth repeating. Year-over-year, not a significant move but the long-term trend is towards having more committed freight. And again that\u2019s a combination of us expanding our presence with our larger more integrated customers and participating in the broader portion of their freight, which is the more committed stuff. But year-over-year, not so much a big change but the obvious difference is that the increase in the cost of hire accelerated this year and made the consequences of those committed relationships different than a year ago.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy on pricing. You mentioned customer pricing is committed at relatively flat prices. Does this imply that average pricing across all truckload contracts was flat on a year-over-year basis, or that actual contract renewals were flattish? Could you provide color on truckload contract re-pricing trends during the first half 2017 bidding season?","Andrew Clarke","Pricing to all customers committed and spot were flat during the quarter. And as John and I and all of us have mentioned numerous times, there\u2019s a mix. We had more customers in the committed\/contractual business where the pricing was slightly down. Pricing to customers in the spot market was up. We just had less of it and as a result overall that number is flat.","If you think about the compression that occurred, I talked a little bit about it during my prepared remarks, but it accelerated during the quarter to where it ended \u2013 for the quarter, it was up 4 on the cost to hire and June ended at plus 6 and that was something that we didn\u2019t expect and quite frankly I don\u2019t think anybody else out there expected.","Because when we were having conversations with our customers as it related to pricing both at the end of 2016 coming into the first half of '17, we and everybody else and our customers assumed that pricing was going to be flat to slightly down and that\u2019s what we had predicted, and it made those investments and those customer relationships based on that and it turned particularly towards the latter part of the second quarter.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. How should we think about operating expense growth for the remainder of the year? Should current freight market fundamentals persist? Would you expect operating expense growth to outpace net revenue growth?","John P. Wiehoff","So again, I started to touch on this earlier. We have not given up our long-term goal that net revenue growth and operating expense growth would stay variable together and over time grow at the same pace, given the periods of time that it can take a quarter or two to adapt to market pricing or to adjust our hiring practices. Unfortunately I do think for the next quarter or two, while we\u2019ll see improvement what we\u2019ll be seeing is that expense activity coming in line with net revenue activity probably not getting in line or crossing over until 2018. We\u2019re managing it every day. There\u2019s a lot on the table. The market conditions can change every day and every week. So we\u2019ll be on top of this doing the best that we can. But that\u2019s where we\u2019re at in our cycle and that\u2019s where we\u2019re at in terms of managing our resources for the current environment.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. How could the Amazon-Whole Foods deal impact your produce business? Will it be a help or a hindrance?","Andrew Clarke","The good news is we are a valued provider to both companies. So we obviously have talked about our relationship with Amazon as well as Whole Foods. So we believe that when we continue to execute in the ability that we have, we\u2019ve carved out for a long time \u2013 as I mentioned, our produce business is how we got started. So we feel pretty good about our team\u2019s ability to execute on produce. And the retail industry broadly speaking is one of our largest verticals. So we think we\u2019ve got a pretty good expertise from that area. So the team is thinking about and obviously it\u2019s yet to be closed, but we are planning on presenting our ability to add more value to those combined entities.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. And that will take us to the bottom of the hour and unfortunately we\u2019re out of time. We apologize that we couldn\u2019t get to all the questions that came in.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, January 31, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Angie Freeman, C.H. Robinson Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Angela K. Freeman","Thank you. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, CEO; and Chad Lindbloom, CFO. John and Chad will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our fourth quarter and full-year performance, and we will follow that with a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate our discussion today. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of the website, which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Chad will be referring to the slides in their prepared comments.","Finally, I would like to remind you that comments made by John, Chad or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","And with that, I'll turn it over to John.","John P. Wiehoff","Thank you, Angie, and thanks to everybody who's taken the time to listen to our fourth quarter call today. As Angie referenced, I'm going to start on our presentation deck with Slide 3, which has our high-level fourth quarter and year-to-date results.","For the fourth quarter of 2011, consolidated net revenues grew 3.4%, income from operations grew 4.8% and EPS was $0.67, up 8.1% from last year. As you can see for the year-to-date numbers for the year ended December 31, 2011, our growth rates were more consistent, which is generally the case in our business model as a big component of our cost structure is based on annual programs. So there you see the net revenue income from operations and net income all up 11% with EPS up 12.4%.","One of the other items that I wanted to highlight on the year-to-date results is that total revenues for 2011 were $10.3 billion. One of the goals we set for ourselves when we became a public company 14 years ago was to reach that $10 billion in gross revenues, and it's kind of a fun milestone for us and we're proud of being able to achieve that in 2011.","I'm going to make some comments now about each of our individual revenue service lines. So moving onto Slide 4, starting with the consolidated transportation results. The transportation net revenues grew 4.9% for the quarter, 13.4% for the year. I'll get more specific on each of the individual service lines, but in general, we had volume growth in most all of our services with varied pricing impacts that I'll talk about given each of the individual services.","On Page 4, one of the things that we like to highlight is the history of margins. And one of the more difficult things to predict or sometimes understand in our business is the fluctuations in the transportation margin percentage. For the fourth quarter of 2011, we had 16.3% net revenue margins on our total transportation. We've talked at length in the past about all of the different variables that cause those margins to fluctuate, including fuel and our supply and demand conditions, our account management decisions around how we price and the delays and timing of customer and provider pricing, and maybe more importantly, the business mix by lane and by type of service. And again, there's a lot of moving parts in there, but I guess the way we would evaluate 2011, is that while the fourth quarter, our 16.3% compared to 17.6% last year and caused some net revenue margin compression in our growth rate year-over-year, if you look at that 10-year history and as we analyze our business model, we feel like those gross margin or transportation margin percentages are within a typical range of our business model during the fourth quarter.","Moving on to the truck results category. As a reminder, our truck net revenues include both full truckload and less-than-truckload net revenues. For the fourth quarter, the combined net revenue grew 5.5%, just under 15% net revenue growth for the year. We do see -- we did have 7% volume growth in the fourth quarter, which increased from the last couple of quarters and year-to-date volume growth on the truckload side of 5%. The truckload net revenue margin declined during the quarter for the reasons that I described before, as truckload is the most significant portion of the overall transportation. So it's indicative of the percentages that I talked about on the previous page.","In our LTL business, we continue to have strong double-digit volume growth with 14% growth for the quarter. I've talked in the last couple of quarters about how our LTL service offering and systems continues to hit well in the marketplace in terms of providing the types of values that a lot of shippers are looking for now, and we continue to be pleased with our volume growth and success in the LTL services.","Moving on to Page 6, our intermodal services. Net revenues grew 7.9% for the quarter, 12% for the year. We did have double-digit volume growth in our intermodal services. But again, that was offset by some net revenue compression. I think our overall feeling towards the intermodal business is through the longer-term secular trend of intermodal growth and taking some share. We feel like we're participating in that, even though it's a smaller component of our business. We feel good about our operational and execution capabilities. We've talked in the past about how we've ordered some dedicated equipment that we've integrated into that business, and we feel very comfortable about our execution capability and the success that we're having in driving that intermodal business.","In terms of pricing and mix changes that compress the net revenue margin a little bit, we did have stronger growth in the East than in the West, which contributed to some of the lane mix where the margins would be a little bit different.","Moving on to Page 7, the air and ocean global forwarding services, this service line is something that we're far less mature in. So you see a lot more of the industry volatility and the impact on our results in the fluctuations of our activity. Ocean net revenues grew 1.8% for the quarter, 10% for the full year. We did have volume growth in our ocean services, but as most of you probably know, that industry softened quite a bit towards the end of the year, driving some pricing declines in our services there.","We continue to see a lot of volatility in our Air business, which is one of the smaller service offerings that we have. So we did see volume and price decline in the quarter. As most of you again probably know, there's a lot of consolidation, economics and density factors that drive your net revenue growth there that, given our lesser scale in that, the industry impacts translate to a meaningful impact for us.","Moving to Slide 8, other logistics services for the quarter. As a reminder, there are several things that are in there but the most significant are the transportation management fees and the customs brokerage business. Our net revenue growth accelerated in the fourth quarter to 12.6% growth for the quarter, 4.6% year-to-date. As we've talked in the past, our transportation management fees and the outsourced services that go with that continue to have really good momentum. We feel like our global capabilities and our industry-leading technology combines to be a good offering for us, and we continue to feel good about our pipeline and the value that we can create above and beyond the traditional transportation services. ","As a reminder, a lot of the fee-based logistics services that we provide that show up as revenues in the other logistics category are also tied to accounts that we have significant freight relationships with. So we feel like this is a good measurement and a good indication of how we're transforming the business to add value to our more dedicated customers with more technology and with more industry knowledge in an integrated way with the transportation services that we offer.","Moving to Page 9, our Sourcing results. Sourcing net revenues declined 13.5% for the quarter, down 7.8% for the year. Our explanation and comments are very similar to the last several quarters. We've had some significant change in the mix of our business with lost business from a large customer. We've also had a lot of seasonal fluctuations which would be typical for that sourcing business. ","Longer term, we do feel good about our growth prospects and that we continue to add value with a lot of new customers. And as we've mentioned before, there will be 1 or 2 more quarters into 2012 where we have difficult comparisons from lost business. That business has been gone for couple of quarters now, but we just continue to cycle through the comparisons for a couple more quarters.","Moving to Slide 10, Payment Services. Net revenues for the quarter up 4.1%, up 8.7% year-to-date. Our MasterCard services continue to grow nicely, as well as some increased fees due to higher fuel prices in the fuel payment services that we give.","With that, I'll finish my comments on the individual revenue service lines. I'm going to turn it over to Chad for some prepared comments on income statement and cash flow, and then I will come back to finish and wrap up with a few thoughts about our long-range strategy and what we're thinking about the future.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Thank you, John. As you can see on Slide 11, as John mentioned earlier, total net revenues grew 3.4% in the fourth quarter and 11.2% for the year. Overall, our operating expenses in the fourth quarter and for the full year were in line with the growth of our net revenues. As John mentioned earlier, and you can see the impact of our variable cost model, in particular -- in any particular quarter, the growth rate between net revenues and operating expenses can fluctuate.","In the fourth quarter of 2011, our personnel expenses declined, and also obviously, declined as a percentage of gross revenues. That was due to a reduction on some of our incentive compensation and on equity compensation programs that are based on the growth in earnings. Because our earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2011 was slower than our earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2010, and also because our growth rates have slowed throughout 2011, where they accelerated throughout 2010, that creates a fluctuation as is designed into our incentive programs.","For the fourth quarter of this year, our restricted stock expense was $6.5 million -- I'm sorry, it's our total equity expense, which includes primarily restricted stock, compared to $14.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.","There were some other -- other operating expenses did increase at a greater rate, driven by some claims, travel, temporary services and some other categories that grew faster than the business.","Moving on to Slide 12, we continue to have a strong balance sheet, with cash and investments of $374 million and no long-term debt. We had a good cash flow from operations, quarter of approximately $136 million for the quarter and $430 million for the year. As you can see, there is quarterly fluctuations sometimes in our cash flow. Even though our cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2011 was lower than 2010, you can see that it increased by nearly 25% for the year.","Our net CapEx for the quarter was approximately $24 million. As we discussed on the third quarter call, in addition to our usual ongoing CapEx, we had some additional expenditures in the fourth quarter. Approximately $6.7 million for the intermodal containers that John mentioned earlier and a net expenditure of about $6.1 million for a corporate aircraft.","Our 2012 CapEx expectations are to be in the $40 million to $45 million range. During the second half of the 2012, we expect to start the construction of another building on our Eden Prairie campus. This estimate of $40 million to $45 million includes about $5 million for the portion of the building that will be paid for during 2012, and we expect the total cost of the building to be approximately $15 million with the remainder being expended in 2013.","Moving on to our share repurchases, we have discussed in the past our strategy of using share repurchases as a variable way to return excess cash to our shareholders. We continued that program. And as you can see, during the fourth quarter of 2011, we purchased 1.3 million shares at an average price of $67.84.","With that, I'll turn it back to John for some final prepared comments on our long-term growth strategy and goals.","John P. Wiehoff","So moving to Page 13, I thought I would start -- at the end of each fiscal year, we like to sort of recap our take on the year and how we're thinking about our long-range plans and what our growth objectives look like. As a reminder, our long-term growth goal is 15% for net revenues, operating income and diluted EPS. Our primary tactics for reaching those goals are to take market share in the services that we offer today, add some new supply chain services and expand what we're capable of, and expand our global network into new geographies and new areas to serve our customers.","We feel like we have a lot of market share left to grow in and we feel like the macro trends around focus on supply chain and focus for the types of value-added things that we're trying to provide to our customers has as good a demand as ever.","If you turn to Page 14 then, there's a lot of numbers on that slide, but we thought it would be useful to kind of look at our 14-year history from the standpoint of our key financial metrics and talk a little bit about our performance and how we think about things going forward. If you look on the far left-hand side of the slide around gross revenues, I mentioned earlier that for 2011, we achieved that milestone of $10.3 billion of gross revenues, which is something we've been striving for during this period of time and are very proud to have achieved it.","Looking at that $10 billion of revenue, I think focuses on the question of market share and kind of growth opportunities. For those of you who are familiar with the industry, you know that the services that we offer and the scale -- we're literally starting with a market of trillions from a global standpoint and at least $1 trillion in the U.S. around the total freight and logistics market. So while we're proud of that $10.3 billion of revenue, it is easy for us to imagine being a $25 billion or $50 billion company in the near-term future and continuing to grow and take market share over the next decade or 2, the way we have in the past. So when we look at our gross revenues and our total presence in the marketplace from the services that we're providing, we continue to feel like that market opportunity is there. And as I mentioned earlier, the macro trends around our customers and most industries focusing in on supply chain as a way to add value and the types of services that we're providing, we feel pretty good about that opportunity.","When you look at the net revenue category, that brings in the discussion around margins and what I talked about earlier in terms of the market fluctuations and all the reasons why our net revenues can grow or change differently than those gross revenues. Similarly to the quarter or the year in this 15-year history, there's a lot of changes going on in those net revenues. But when we analyze our business from a margin and capacity standpoint, we feel like we can continue to buy and sell services and grow our business the way we have over the past couple of decades, really since deregulation in 1980, but particularly, since 1997 as a public company.","So while we expect those margin percentages and the net revenue growth to fluctuate a little bit, sometimes in unpredictable ways based on the market, we do believe that our business opportunity and our business model will stay intact with regards to the net revenue piece of it.","When you move over to the operating income and the variable nature of the model that we've talked about several times in our call, if you look to the far right-hand side of this slide, you see the operating income as a percentage of net revenue staying very variable and increasing throughout this period of time. ","We do believe that we can continue to drive productivity and drive efficiency in our models, and as we've talked a number of times, our compensation and incentive system, which are a huge part of our cost structure, have a lot of variability to them and we will expect to continue that going forward.","If you look at the 3-percentage change columns around net revenue, operating income and diluted EPS, we're very proud of the fact that there's no negative numbers in there. I think that really speaks to our continued emphasis on growth and the fact that our business and cost structure is very much driven by a variable cost model. We talked in our last call at length about 2009, how that $1 billion decline in total revenues still resulted in a slight growth in net revenues because of margin expansion and the challenges that we've had to dig out of that over the last couple of years. Because of our variable cost model, a lot of the expense was taken out in 2009 when we had a more challenging year from the beginning of the recession. But over the last couple of years, our stock expenses and others -- operating expenses, while they've come back to more normal levels, we still have had some of the more challenging comparisons from quarter-to-quarter as the business sort of grows back.","When you look at the year-to-date 2011, we're proud of the fact that we got back to double-digit growth in all of our categories, and we feel that when you look at all of these different key metrics, that it does support the case that a 15% long-term growth goal remains reasonable for us.","Down on the bottom of the slide, we have the different compounded growth rates for the periods there, the 15, 10 and 5 years. We're proud of the fact that we've achieved our growth goals as a public company. Obviously, we haven't in the last 5 years in terms of that 15% growth goal. But we do feel like our opportunity is there in the marketplace. Our execution and our variable model is in as good a shape as it's ever been, and we think we're pretty well positioned to emphasize growth and continue to expand our presence in the marketplace going into 2012.","Moving to our last slide of prepared comments then on Page 15. In terms of more specific comments for 2012, we did share in the press release that while it's still very hard to give guidance and be too forward-looking in our comments, we have found it most productive to just share what we do know to date, which is that through January 30 into 2012 North American truckload volume growth per business day is about 7% and total net revenue growth from an enterprise standpoint was about 6%. As we always like to share, the caveat that those things can change quickly, they move around a lot, especially early in a first quarter like this where March is probably the biggest month of the quarter and things can change quickly. But that's what we know to date.","In terms of the variables that we control and emphasizing our growth and focus into 2012, we are hiring, probably as aggressively as we have in the last couple of years, to continue to build out our network. We've got some training and investment in our people that we continue to ramp up on and feel very good about how we can add value with our customers from a broader account management and broader service offering standpoint.","We continue to make significant investments in IT. We've talked a lot the last couple of years about our systems investments and our integration around the world. We're happy with how that's going and we're investing more aggressively than ever in the automation of a lot of our services, as well as -- when I talked about the other logistic services really expanding the technology offerings and the types of things that we're doing with customers, which we think is not only an additional source of revenue for us, but really helping to transform the business and help us grow it in a meaningful way.","So we're trying to build on that return to double-digit 11% growth in 2011 and emphasize some of the growth processes that we know helped drive the success of our company. We understand that the last couple of years have taught us that the overall economic environment can have an impact on our business and we have to stay flexible and stay sensitive to that. So hopefully, we'll get some cooperation in North America and Europe, especially, in terms of economic growth and a stronger economy that -- to help us get back into our longer-term growth target areas. But we feel very good about our long-term opportunity, how we're executing, our business model and the relevance to the marketplace.","That's the end of our prepared comments. So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to begin our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","John, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the -- you touched on it earlier, but the gross margin squeeze on the truck side this quarter. To what extent is it kind of a natural part of the cycle and I look back to '03 and there appears to be similar type of dynamic or parallel to be drawn there with volumes or positive pricing, growth that's positive but slowing, and it's not so much being squeezed on the capacity cost side as much as it is the normalization of gross profit per unit. So could you talk a little bit about that and your ability, I guess, to continue to get pricing from customers and their willingness to pay for capacity?","John P. Wiehoff","Yes. So what we have always talked about it when we analyze our business model is that a balanced market or a more stable market where freight is generally flowing a long route guides and bid prices, the way things were planned by most shippers at the beginning of the year, is a period of time where our margins will tend to normalize. And I think over the last couple of years, as we and others have talked about it being a balanced North American truckload market, what you've seen is just the normalization of some of our margins back to a more typical long-term range. If you look at that 10-year chart that we have on our slide, what you really see is that the recession and some of the ongoing volatility in 2008 and 2009 especially, where there were unprecedented volume declines but margin expansion. A lot of the last couple of years has just been the ripple effect of those impacts in the trucking community. The way we handle it, we've also talked about -- there are times when we'll go to shippers for rate increases or the shippers really drive when the bids occur. And there are timing differences between how the carrier cost will adjust and the shipper billing rates will adjust. And throughout the last part of 2011 here, while there were some customer price increases, our carrier pricing was increasing at modestly higher rates which was leaving -- leading to that net revenue compression from a year-over-year standpoint. But overall, we would characterize it as a balanced market that has gravitated back towards fairly typical margins from a long-term standpoint.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, to follow on that, you described the market as balanced and volume growth appears to have normalized on the truck side. And to take share on the margin, is it just a matter of introducing some volatility, whether it's demand volatility, capacity volatility, to allow your share gain opportunity that you highlighted to begin to play itself out?","John P. Wiehoff","Yes. Measuring market share is a little challenging in the trucking piece because there's so many different indexes and it's hard to tell. But our general belief is that we can sort of hold our own during any period in terms of growing with the market and growing with our customers, but that our large market share gains generally come during periods of volatility, where there are route guide failures or a lot of more transactional freight than -- and we think we can help in different ways and be very flexible in the marketplace. So we're proud of our growth and success from the last couple of the years and where we're executing and yet we acknowledge that this hasn't been likely our best gains in market share over the last couple of years in North American truckload because it has been a fairly balanced market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","John, help me think about sort of the return to these long-term growth targets. Because I see some things that I'm sort of struggling a bit to reconcile. It would seem that only the market can get you back there, if I'm understanding you. Because when we look at your month-to-date growth rates, it's even below the 5-year CAGR, I think, and the 5-year CAGR is below the 10-year. So is it just the market or are there things like headcount growth and branch offices or an acquisition or something that's going to get you that you can actually do yourself? Or are we really just wait for the market from here as evidenced by that long 15-year trend that markets come and go, and we'll see when it comes back. Is that the right way to think of it?","John P. Wiehoff","It's all of the above. If you look at our 30-year history from deregulation or the last 15 years, we've had some acquisitions that have helped us expand our service offerings and have helped us grow into new geographies. And we continue to look for those more aggressively now than we have for the past couple of years. We have opened offices and used hiring as a way to drive growth and take market share. And again, we didn't do that as much the last several years because of the overall environment and uncertainty and the fact that we felt like we had excess capacity so that we could drive productivity gains for a while. There's no question that GDP growth and the tailwind of a stronger freight market helps to create some of that volatility or disruption or incremental need that we think we can get more than our fair share of. And then another point that I think is worth understanding, though, is that if you look back through this entire 30-year history, we don't necessarily need 15% volume growth to achieve our 15% revenue and earnings growth. We've always had some margin fluctuation. But over time, our mix and our margins have expanded a little bit, as well as using productivity to gain some of that. So it's a long list of how we manage the business and all the different things that we do to drive growth that we think can help us get back to a longer-term growth target.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And if you look at the international opportunity on the truck side, not sort of air and ocean. But is that yet at a point where it's worth thinking about what are the growth rates there? I assume they're much higher than the U.S., but maybe it's not big enough to move the needle and sort of -- is there sort of any kind of color you can provide in terms of scale that you have there and where that can go?","John P. Wiehoff","Yes, the European truck business is by far the most significant outside of North America. We believe that's somewhere between 3% or 4% of transportation net revenues. We continue to think that there's tremendous upside for us to be as large of a truckload service provider in Europe as we are in North America. It took us many decades to get to where we are here and we know it's going to be a long growth process there as there as well, too. But we feel like that's a marketplace that has a lot of opportunity and has a business environment similar to what we have in North America so that we can continue to grow at a faster pace there for the foreseeable feature. We have some road business in South America and are working to try to establish some of it in Asia. So those non-North American truck growth rates will help us over the next 10 or 15 years. They're not probably going to make a difference in the next quarter or 2 despite how successful we might be. But from a longer-term standpoint around diversifying our services and expanding in other geographies, they continue to be an important part of our strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Congratulations on the $10 billion. John, could you spend a little time on the Sourcing gross margin which seemed to contract pretty good sequentially? I don't remember those types of moves in Sourcing. I was wondering if you could maybe put a little color around that.","John P. Wiehoff","So I think the main thing that you see there is in a lot of our different commodity categories, the fact that we lost some dedicated portions of business from a large customer, we were very aggressively trying to replace that with other customers and growing our business. So there's some typical seasonal fluctuations just based upon the crops and the strength of the supply and demand in the growing environment. But we also expanded pretty aggressively into some new items and some new customer relationships that didn't have the margin of some of the traditional business. So we actually had a slight volume growth for the quarter. But because of the significant shift in the types of items and the customer relationships that ended up with some meaningful net revenue decline.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Should we now think about that, at least over the intermediate term, as you rebuild volumes, is that a sub-8% or is it a low 8% -- which would be a progression with that margin now?","Chad M. Lindbloom","It's really difficult to predict because it does depend on a lot of different factors like weather and the mix and the prices of the commodities as well as the types of programs that we're successful with. Some of the new initiatives that John mentioned and some of the new volume we were taking on, we do expect those margins of some of those programs to expand over time. So I think 8% is very high 7s, or 8% is probably a good target.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So if I just look at the truckload pricing you got from your customers slowed to about 3% in the quarter, how are you thinking about 2012 for pricing in truckload and how does that impact your view on truck net revenue margins? I guess, at the end of the that I'm just trying to understand, what's the environment you need to start seeing those net revenue margins start to expand again now that they're back at, I guess, what you said, John, as fairly typical levels?","John P. Wiehoff","Well, the -- I guess, there was a couple of questions in there. From an overall pricing standpoint, there is a fair amount of bid activity that's going on in the early part of the year which is common for this part of it. I think pricing is pretty interesting right now in the marketplace because, as everybody probably knows, there's been a lot of concern about impacts on the supply side and the fact that there's not a lot of trucks. And I think you see a pretty wide -- we see at least a wide avenue of different approaches around pricing where many shippers are trying to lock in more modest increases but make sure that they have good access to capacity going forward and others are trying to be more aggressive. But I would say low single-digit price increases are more common. What will change this kind of volatility that we talked about is that whenever there is a period of time where supply or demand gets significantly out of whack with the other side. So if we see a pretty tight capacity environment this year, and there's a lot of freight that starts to fall through route guides and there's a lot of transactional opportunities that customers need help with, that's when you'll see pricing start to move more fluid and you'll start to see more significant price increases and it will cause our margins to move around more aggressively like they have during periods in the past. So if we have this balanced market and things go fairly according to plan, at some point, our margins will at least normalize. And there won't be net revenue margin compression just because it will level off. But when they typically expand is when you start to see some of those more immediate opportunities based on market tightness.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Do you think it needs to be a demand-driven market tightness or any kind of market tightness? I mean, I guess in 2011, in many ways the market felt tight from a supply perspective but not from a demand perspective. Do you think you need demand or either way?","John P. Wiehoff","Demand is usually better just because incremental freight sort of allows us to keep our contractual commitments at healthy levels. And normally, we're getting more volume in dedicated relationships when there's a demand-driven side of it. So demand growth is better when that causes the disequilibrium. But, yes, like in the fourth quarter of 2008 and early 2009, when demand fell through the floor, you saw the opposite where we had volume declines like everybody else but significant margin expansions. So it can come in either direction, but we would prefer a healthy economy and strong demand growth, which we think has the best long-term outcome for us.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay, that's helpful. And just last thing real quick, if I can, we think about the 6% net revenue growth through January. Is there something about the comps in February and March that make it likely to be above or below that 6%, or the comps feel pretty normal the next 2 months?","Chad M. Lindbloom","No. I don't think there's anything unusual about the months of the year. Like John said -- or the months of the quarter. And like John said, as January tends to be the smallest month of the first quarter, so it's difficult to know how the whole quarter will turn out based on the first 30 days.","John P. Wiehoff","Yes. By March, you're generally starting to see some greater indication of how tight the spring might be in ramping up of volumes. So I would say that March, by definition, tends to be a little bit less predictable, even where January tends to be more soft from a volume standpoint.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. I guess, I was thinking just from a year-over-year perspective, if things get tougher or easier in February, March.","John P. Wiehoff","Not so much within the quarter. I don't think there's anything that we can say. When we look at all of our metrics, the fact that we grew faster and performed better in the first half of 2011, we do feel like our comparisons in general are a little bit harder in the first part of the year with the Sourcing business and some of the margin metrics around profit per load and other things that we analyze internally. But within the first quarter, I don't think there's really anything from a comparability standpoint. Obviously, if you'll look at the operating expenses, there's variance from quarter-to-quarter for the fluctuations that we've talked about. The big variable will be what happens in the transportation demand side of it, especially in the month of March and how much, if any, incremental volume and dislocation there is which would probably cause, I would guess, the biggest variation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just wanted to ask John a little bit. We talked -- I think it was Bill's question, talked about kind of the long-term growth drivers in terms of things that you control -- can control and things that you're working on. In this kind of balanced environment that you've been in for a while, are there any different levers that you're trying to pull currently to make up the difference or is it really just as simple as the long-term C.H. Robinson strategy of managing for that long term?","John P. Wiehoff","There are some things that we can do more aggressively. Most of them fall under what we would refer to as account management strategies where we try to expand the service offerings and expand account penetration. And then there is just the hiring strategy. A lot of people debate, is hiring people a growth strategy when you can go into new markets and new services? And as we've talked over the last couple of years, we've been in that balance of growth and efficiency. We've been managing towards efficiency and making sure that the volatility of the market didn't cause us to serve our current customers in a lesser way, or that we compromised our incentives or the variability of our model. And now that we're back to a little bit different environment, we can press on some of those things a little bit harder without being concerned about our service levels deteriorating. So we can hire people, we can open offices, we can look a little bit more aggressively at acquisitions like we have done in some periods of time and we'll look to expand services and grow those account relationships with current customers. When you put all that together, I mean, those are what we do, those are our long-term competencies and competitive advantages that we continue to push on. And then we do -- there's a certain element of accepting the fact that at some times the market is going to give us different things. And we try to be ready for the higher growth when it comes and tolerate the lesser growth when that's what the market gives us if we're executing the best we can.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then my second question is, when we think about pricing as you're kind of rolling out and trying to penetrate different customers with multiple services, and obviously, the increasing investment in technology to link up to your customers, how do you think about pricing as you're doing more services or more integration versus what may be used to be a standalone service?","John P. Wiehoff","So the transportation pricing of any customer relationship generally stands alone and is pretty market-driven around the rates and the pricing, the way it always has been over the last couple of decades. So even when we're working in more of an outsource solution or systems-provider environment, there's almost always very typical bids. And we will compete on those bids lane by lane, and the markets get very competitive and price driven for all those transportation services much like it has. When you get into the fee-based stuff and tying that together, it is different pricing models around understanding the people and the incremental technology cost that we're going to incur in order to implement an account or manage an account and then trying to understand what's a fair contribution to fixed cost and overhead in order to manage that relationship. So it's much more like other professional services-type environments where we're looking at time and cost and trying to make sure that it's healthy ROI for our customer for the fees that they would be spending with us, and that we can get a return on it by leveraging in our network. And ideally, what we're doing with more and more of our top customers is some kind of combined relationship, where we have those fee-based services and kind of the broader supply chain initiatives around taking costs out and driving value. And then a component of that is our participation in the freight management and the route guide execution, where we'll end up with traditional transportation revenues at normal margins as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit about the productivity in terms of net revenue per employee which looks like it got quite a bit weaker in Q4, certainly relative to what you printed last quarter. And it seems that within that, maybe that other operating expense was part of the problem. Could you go back to that and dig into that in a little bit more detail? What was behind the big increase in the other operating expense line?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Okay. So there's 2 questions in there. One's about net revenue per person because -- the SG&A expenses don't have anything to do with that. Net revenue per person, the way we calculated it, based on average heads was about 199,000 compared to 204,000 last year and 212,000. The one thing that we've always said about our business model is when we are generating less revenues, it's actually mainly driven on profits but less profits per head, our compensation expense will go down as well. So although there was slightly less -- something like 2% less net revenue per [indiscernible] compared to last year's fourth quarter, there was about 9% less personnel expense compared to per person compared to last year's fourth quarter. So I would say there is going to be fluctuations in that net revenue per person, number going forward, and the fact that it's down to 199,000 would be concerning if the personnel expense didn't react the way it was supposed to. And then your second question was SG&A expenses or the nonpersonal expense growth.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, operating expense.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Yes. The slide highlighted the major categories where we saw growth above the level of the business. And going back to that slide and talking a little bit about each of the different categories, the travel is -- us being aggressive in the marketplace, there's also impacts of our cost per flight are up and the implementation of our global system has created a lot more travel than we had a year ago. Some of the temp services is various different -- mainly call-center type people where we're starting to leverage temporary services which is taking away a little bit of headcount. But it's mainly a temp-to-hire process with some of our centralized call centers. Depreciation and amortization, that's mainly due to the investments we've made in IT over the years. And then over the years which are beginning to amortize. When you look at the claims expense, we do have lumpy claims expense in our business our business. There's constantly a list of different claims we're negotiating. And we did have quite a few freight claims this quarter where we decided to step in and take care of our customers' claim. Many of those will continue to pursue the carrier, the ones that are officially liable to the -- or for the freight claims. But we did take care of our customers and some of them to help maintain our customer relationships as part of that account management strategy John mentioned earlier. There was also one contingent auto liability settlement that was not a large one. The total settlement amount was within our retention limits, so it wasn't a very -- very large claim, like we had in the first quarter, which was tens of millions of dollars. This one was under our retention limit of $5 million and we were a participant in a settlement with the other parties to the claim.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about headcount. When we think about 2012, you mentioned about hiring aggressively and training the staff. Do you feel like we're at a point now, just given on kind of the volume outlook for 2012, you might be able to see some slowing in the rate of growth at least in the headcount in 2012, or is this something that's going to keep up with the pace of volume growth?","John P. Wiehoff","We've talked often in the past that with our 220-some offices, we do allow a high degree of discretion. The managers are really making a lot of those hiring decisions based on their pipeline of sales activity and how they see the business with a little bit of benchmarking and coaching and encouragement from the leadership team. Some of it is just the resumption of investment in people and investment in our network to grow the business and some of it will be based upon actual wins and what they're seeing in the marketplace and if they want to expand into another service line more aggressively. So it'll be a combination of all of those decisions based on the individual productivity levels and growth goals at the branch network. We talked about the net revenue per person on the previous question. Some of that, too, can be driven just from the fact that we're investing in people and starting to hire a little bit more aggressively. We feel like we get those people up to speed fairly quickly in our business model. But when we take off on growth, just like margins, they will fluctuate. Sometimes the personnel expense will lead a little bit and then the growth will start to come with that.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So I guess that's kind of the root of the question, you guys have been hiring at reasonably aggressive pace. In the 2011 calendar year you potentially could see some uptick there but I guess, it's going to depend on a kind of case-by-case basis from branch level.","John P. Wiehoff","Yes.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then if I could just follow up just on the Sourcing side. When you talk about the absolute level of business that you're doing, now that you've seen most of the culling, I feel like you said that you're going to see some tough comps on a year-over-year basis, I think, persisting for a couple of quarters. But when we think about the absolute level of volumes that you're doing there, is it fair to say that we've reached kind of a level that's appropriate for that and that's just more of a comparison issue going forward? Or is it still a little bit more of the adjusting to the losses of customers?","John P. Wiehoff","No, we've reached the baseline for the last couple of quarters. The challenge is that even in that baseline business, there's a lot of seasonal fluctuations based upon the commodity strength and strawberries that are very different than lettuce, they're very different than potatoes. And so when you have commodity mix and different crop levels and different seasons, the volumes in the buy-sell margins can change quite a bit even within what is otherwise consistent categories. So there will continue to be a little bit of fluctuation but your primary statement is inaccurate that for at least for a couple of quarters now, we've been to our new run rates and our new level of business and it's just mostly the first quarter part of the second quarter are cycling out of some of the lost dedicated business that we had.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So fourth quarter a function of kind of seasonality that would be typical and we can use that as a benchmark going forward?","John P. Wiehoff","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess going back to the long-term guidance, the biggest pushback that I typically get when talking to clients is that the environment has changed, at least from a capacity standpoint. We're not coming out of deregulation where there's a lot of market share growth in truckload carriers. And in fact, there's been an unprecedented amount of contraction in terms of the available pool of capacity. And then the other piece, obviously, being the influx of -- at least a more visible brokerage competition. So I guess, the question I have is a, do you guys feel like there's actually more brokerage competition now than there has been in the past? B, do you think that the capacity pool has ultimately shrunk to a point where the market's a little bit different? And I guess, the third part of that question before it gets too unwieldy is, how much does or does not that actually change your ability to execute your business?","John P. Wiehoff","Okay. Lots of good questions wrapped up in there. I would say, first off, there's no question that over the last 30 years, the capacity environment has evolved. And especially some of the regulatory stuff around the impacts of emissions and hours of service and CSA rules, there is a different environment in terms of the decision-making and the cost side of how truckers are ordering equipment and how capacity is being added. And so there is a pretty strong sentiment which we certainly feel that over the last couple of years, the marketplace has probably not added supply or added capacity the same way it has during a lot of periods in the past. You know when we went public 14 years ago, there were a lot of people who believed that there would be significant carrier consolidation and the fragmentation would go away in the short term and it wouldn't be there. And we've always been of the view that it's a fragmented industry, that supply and demand will fluctuate. And from a real high-level standpoint, I don't see a lot of change in that. The largest carriers aren't that much larger than 14 years ago. The big changes have been just around all the economics and regulations around the supply side and the fact that over the last couple of years, we've had a more muted economic growth, and we've had a lot of hesitancy to add a lot of supply because of the unknown impacts of financing and rule changes and the economy and all the rest of that stuff. I'd like to believe that that's a more temporary thing that will get back to more typical capitalistic fluctuations in supply and demand, and that people will be ordering trucks and that there will be higher growth than slower growth. So I don't think that fundamental dynamic has changed a lot. From the standpoint of the competitive landscape, that's something we get asked about a lot as well, too. There -- I think if you look at the absolute numbers of brokers, there's probably fewer of them than there was 10 or 20 years ago, but there's more big ones and more people at least proclaiming their desire to be larger or to grow aggressively or people who have money who are into it. So from the standpoint of larger, more visible competitors, there certainly is a change and that there's more of them and they're more vocal about what their aspirations are and how they're participating. What we've analyzed around that, though, is we really do believe that there's been a pretty positive trend towards third-party logistics, the acceptance of it and the fact that our model has a much greater portion of the marketplace that it applies to today. So as third-party models and managing truckload capacity has evolved in the marketplace, how that greater market share and greater opportunity balances out with all of the additional providers who are operating under that method, it gets hard to tell day-to-day, month-to-month. But it still feels to us like there's plenty of opportunities to grow for the foreseeable future.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I mean, I guess, the fear is that you guys were the original hedge fund in an inefficient market and now you guys you have a lot of other guys coming in, making this market much more efficient. And now it's harder to dig out the opportunities. But time will tell, I guess, on that.","John P. Wiehoff","Yes and I -- that's certainly a valid theory and time will tell as to whether that is the case or not. It feels like if that is the case that based upon the size of the market and how we see things, that, that impact is going to be a more gradual one. I think sometimes when we see a net revenue compression in a quarter and we know that it's almost entirely driven by fuel price fluctuations and changes in rates that there's a temptation to attribute a quarter-over-quarter variance to a change in the competitive landscape, where, by our judgment, while that's certainly a valid component that we're paying a lot of attention to that, that started, frankly, 15 years ago. When we went public, there was a lot of other companies who were getting into it and trying to compete and there are many new ones today as well, too. So we see that as a very relevant factor but a much more longer-term gradual one that oftentimes gets inserted into the otherwise kind of quarter-to-quarter fluctuations that some of the other things cause.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. A little bit more I guess, eclectic OJ recalls, are those going to hurt sourcing in Q1?","John P. Wiehoff","No, they won't. We really only deal with the fresh produce. We do occasionally get involved with recalls, where there can be some, but not in processed foods or processed juice.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And last one for Chad, interest income, a bit higher here this quarter. Just curious what was impacting that and the tax rate for next year.","Chad M. Lindbloom","We don't see any major changes in the tax rate, the 38%, 38.5% range for next year. The interest income, actually was some investment income. Prior to being public, we had put some money into a -- so we're talking in the early to mid-90s, we've put some money into a privately held company as a minority shareholder. We own something like 2% of the company. We had written that investment off long ago but that company actually sold a portion of their business and we generated cash income from it. So that was about $1.1 million or $1.2 million of that investment and other income. So we're still not making much money on our excess cash.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And so that's one-time. Is there any residual that gets paid out in '12 that we should be thinking about?","Chad M. Lindbloom","There is some, but it's -- we're not counting on it until we have it. But yes, we are due more payments for that as well in '12.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JP Morgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, I have -- let's see, 2 questions for you. So that when you're looking at the long-term growth and, John, kind of the outlook that your opportunity is similar that it's been the last 10, 15 years, one of the things that stands out to me is that your earnings growth has been -- and operating income as well, has been boosted by your margin expansion. That's been very impressive from kind of 28% operating income as a percent of net revenue up to 42%. So is there -- can you give us some thoughts on how much further that can progress? And is it realistic to think that that's less of a driver of growth the next 10 years than it was the last 10, which means I guess, you have to make it up somewhere else?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Yes, so for starters, we feel very good about the sustainability of the progress that we've made, and that mid-to high-40s is probably achievable over a period of time that we can continue to leverage our network and gain some further productivity enhancements. A lot of that is driven by some of the systems investments and fee-based things that we're doing that are a different business model, where you would start to recognize that. And some of it is investments in Europe and Asia and other places where we're just getting to more normal levels of profitability. So we would acknowledge that, going from 28% to 42%, that's probably -- you're probably not going to see 14 percentage points of improvement over the next 15 years but we feel very good about the sustainability of where we've gotten to and that there is room for some further improvement over the next 10 or 20 years.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But you -- to be clear, you think mid-to high-40% is -- you can get towards that area given some time?","John P. Wiehoff","Yes.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then the second one, in terms of your market, there's been a lot of discussion about kind of truckload capacity. What about the idea that intermodal is taking more of the growth in freight and if truck capacity is somewhat constrained going forward for a variety of reasons then just simply more of the freight growth goes to intermodal. And if that's the case, does that imply that you perhaps need a new solution there? I'm thinking of an  acquisition. It could be a more aggressive organic push. But what are your thoughts on strategically, whether intermodal is becoming a more important potentially driver of growth for you?","John P. Wiehoff","We do think intermodal is more important, and it's a very lane-specific thing. We have been making investments and we will continue to look at what we need to do to stay competitive and make sure that we participate in the growth of that secular trend because we do think it's real. But we always do remind people that if you look at intermodal and the size of the containerized intermodal freight relative to the size of the truckload market today, it's still a relatively small market compared to the entire over-the-road industry today. So the way we think about it is that there are some long-haul West Coast to Chicago and some East Coast lanes where the rails have made very good investments and they're doing a very good job of taking some freight off the highway and we are participating in that. And that could be impacting, especially some of the full truckload, longer-haul lanes that would have less growth for a period of time around it. Our general view is that we want to be a better service provider and equal pricing and capability in all the different transportation services and then do a better job, like one of the specific things that I would say is, we have a point of pride around doing truck versus rail mode selection and helping customers that have seasonal freight or freight that needs to go back and forth between the 2 modes. And if we have competitive pricing and access to both modes of transportation and better systems for helping our customers understand what the right choices are in the marketplace that we can participate in the overall economic growth. So we'll continue to look at it and we're committed to making whatever types of investments we need to stay relevant in that and we do think it's growing in importance.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Do you consider acquisitions in that or not?","John P. Wiehoff","Yes, we have. Yes.","Angela K. Freeman","Unfortunately, we're out of time so that will have to be our last question today. We apologize we couldn't get to everybody.

Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call October 29, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","","John Wiehoff \u2013 Chief Executive Officer","Chad Lindbloom \u2013 SVP & Chief Financial Officer","Tim Gagnon \u2013 Director, Investor Relations","","Analysts","","","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C. H. Robinson Q3 2014 Conference Call. (Operator instructions.) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday October 29th, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, the Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Tim Gagnon","Thank you, Debbie, and good morning everyone. On our call this morning will be John Wiehoff, our Chief Executive Officer, and Chad Lindbloom, Chief Financial Officer. John and Chad will provide some prepared remarks on the highlights of our Q3 and we\u2019ll follow that with a response to pre-submitted questions we have received after our earnings release yesterday. ","Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate our discussion today. Those slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website which is located at www.chrobinson.com. John and Chad will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments.","I\u2019d like to remind you that comments made by John, Chad or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management\u2019s expectations.","With that I will now turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments on Slide 3 with a review of Q3 2014 results.","John Wiehoff","Thank you, Tim. Thanks everybody for taking the time to listen to our call. On that Slide 3 that highlights our consolidated results for Q3 2014 I\u2019ll highlight just a couple of the key metrics that we reference every quarter.","Total revenues for Q3 were up 4.5%. Net revenues grew at 13.9%. The higher net revenue growth was driven by margin expansion that we\u2019ll share several comments about to explain further. Income from operations in the quarter was up 15.3% and net income increased at 16.0%. ","So overall our operating expenses and our income from operations are growing roughly in line with our net revenue growth. There are some variations in the fixed and variable expenses that Chad and I will cover with more comments on later but in general our income grew at the rate of our net revenues.","Our EPS for the quarter was $0.85 compared to $0.69 last year which represents a 23% growth in EPS for the quarter. As the slide highlights, the variance in the growth in the EPS rate was impacted by a lower effective tax rate this quarter that we\u2019ll come back to as well, and our change in our capital structure that improved our EPS growth for the quarter.","Moving on to Slide 4 and our overall Transportation results for the quarter. Transportation revenues increased 6.5% and net revenues were up 14.9% for Q3. As we have been for a while on Slide 4 we show a ten-year history of our Transportation net revenue margin. As I\u2019ve commented in the past there\u2019s a lot going on on this slide because it\u2019s total Transportation and it includes not only truckload which is two-thirds of our revenues, but less-than-truckload, intermodal as well as our international services. ","But nonetheless, with all of the margin fluctuations and mix issues that are included we do find it very helpful to look at the consolidated Transportation margins to sort of put the quarter in context to the past.","The 16.1% net revenue margin for the quarter as you can see represents a 120 basis point improvement from Q3 last year. If you look at the chart which you\u2019ll also notice it\u2019s the 14.9% from last year is the lowest number on the ten-year chart here. So while there\u2019s a lot going on with cycles and secular changes that we\u2019ve discussed in the past, the improvement in the quarter to 16.1% represents results that are about the midpoint of the last ten years from an overall margin standpoint.","With that I think I\u2019ll move on to the next slide and talk specifically about Truckload transportation. On Slide 5 our Truckload results for the quarter: net revenues increased 15.8% for the quarter and are up 10.6% year-to-date. ","The metric that we\u2019ve been sharing for the last couple of years to try to help understand the margin fluctuations in Truckload are highlighted in the upper right-hand corner of Slide 5 and they show that on average our customer pricing for the quarter increased 10% compared to Q3 a year ago. At the same time our average cost of hire or approximate cost of hire increased 8.0% compared to Q3 a year ago.","This quarter, similar to what we\u2019ve talked about in the past with all of the meaningful changes that went on in the truckload market this year there\u2019s quite a range of actual price increases that are driving those averages. Transactional pricing in the quarter continues to be often in excess of 10% while more committed or contractual pricing averages something more in the mid-single digit type increase. ","So the significant changes in the market with the lack of a lot of surge or flex capacity has resulted in overall price increases but much more significant price increases for the spot market.","The other metric that we talk about is our volume increases. Volume increased 1% for the quarter. As we talk all the time taking market share and growing our volume is an important part of our long-term strategy and our approach to the market. We talked at the beginning of this year with all of the meaningful price changes and shifts in capacity in the market that we were going to be very focused on serving our current customers and serving our committed accounts, and making sure that we are adapting to market conditions. ","So while we would concede that we did not likely take market share during Q3 2014 we think we\u2019re doing the right thing to manage our business and to serve our customers. And we still have confidence that in the long term we\u2019ll be able to aggressively grow our volumes and take market share.","Moving to Slide 6, our LTL results for the quarter: net revenues in LTS increased 10.6%. Volumes increased approximately 7%. Similar to the Truckload service, demand for LTL services and related pricing both increased during the quarter.","In our LTL business we have both customer-specific pricing arrangements that we work with our customers and our carriers, and we have some general rate tariffs that also increased. This year unlike some years there\u2019s been multiple increase to some of those general rate tariffs that are in the marketplace reflective of the fact that customer demand and pricing in the marketplace continues to increase in the LTL mode as well.","We commented in the last quarter and would say again this time that driver shortages and some other cost pressures are impacting the LTL carriers that we interact with more significantly than in previous periods, and that is what\u2019s driving a portion of the price increases in the marketplace. Also I\u2019d make the comment that since our LTL pricing, especially with the larger customers and carriers tends to be a little bit more automated we have a little less margin fluctuation quarter-to-quarter in the LTL results than we do in Truckload.","Moving then to Slide 7, our intermodal results for Q3. As you can see on Slide 7 net revenue for the quarter increased 3.8% and volume was approximately flat for the quarter. I\u2019ve discussed in the past and we continue this year to work on the operational effectiveness of the committed capacity that we have as well as managing our network more aggressively. We do believe that we were able to improve our efficiency and that contributed to the net revenue increase by making sure that we\u2019re managing our equipment properly and serving the customers in the optimum way.","It\u2019s been talked about a lot in our industry and we were also impacted by the railroad service issues that are happening. For us, because we have a smaller network and are managing it more aggressively that primarily translates into making it more difficult to increase volumes, but we\u2019re proud of the service that we\u2019re able to deliver our customers despite some of the service issues that are going on in the networks.","Moving then to Slide 8, our Global Forwarding results for the quarter \u2013 ocean, air and Customs results. Net revenues for Ocean increased 15.5% in Q3. Air net revenues increased 13.1% and Customs Brokerage services were up 24.0% for the quarter.","In our Global Forwarding business we are just a couple of days away from our November 1st anniversary of two years ago when we made a significant investment to acquire Phoenix International. The Global Forwarding Division of Robinson has been through a lot of change the last couple of years, and as we talked last quarter we\u2019re proud of the fact that despite all of that change and investment that\u2019s happened over the last couple of years we have been able to grow our net revenue each quarter over the last couple of years while all of that change and investment is going on.","I won\u2019t grind through a lot of the integration details again because I\u2019ve hit those pretty hard in the past but I would sort of summarize it by saying that we feel very good about our first two years and our integration plan is largely complete, except for some IT initiatives that are going to carry on into 2015 that are fairly important to continue to make our network operate as one and improve our operating efficiencies. But from a team standpoint and a customer standpoint the offices are all settled, we have one leadership team, we have one network and we do feel very good about all that has been accomplished over the last couple of years.","We also do feel good about the phases of cross-selling and trying to manage our business more aggressively. We talked about how in year one it was primarily focused on service contracts and aligning those offices into one network; and how this year we have begun to move into some more aggressive cross-selling and trying to leverage the investments that we\u2019ve made over the last couple of years. And we do feel like those investments are starting to get some traction.","Our growth during the quarter and our increased growth rate is a combination of a bunch of things. There\u2019s some more favorable market conditions; there\u2019s some current customers that we\u2019re getting more freight from and we do have some demonstrated success in cross-selling where traditional domestic customers today are more receptive to some of our Global Forwarding capabilities and pricing based on our increased capabilities.","So we feel very good about the results from the Global Forwarding Division and we feel like we are starting to see some of the return of investment that we\u2019ve made over the last couple of years.","Moving then to Slide 9, our Other Logistics Services results for Q3. Net revenues for the quarter increased 18.5%. From a definition standpoint, again, it\u2019s helpful to remember the primary or largest source of revenue in this category is our Transportation Management Services. It also includes Warehousing and Small Parcel.","This line item, and I think I\u2019ve said this every quarter but it probably bears repeating, that this is one of the more important sources of high growth that we have because not only does it represent an opportunity for us to continue to expand \u2013 and we will continue to invest in it \u2013 but many of these services are provided to our larger, integrated customers where we also have significant Transportation revenue that\u2019s derived from them. So it\u2019s reflective of the fact that for many of our customers, integrating our services and providing them in a more unified way is an important part of how we\u2019re changing and how the market is changing and what they\u2019re looking for.","Moving on to Slide 10 and our Sourcing results for Q3. Sourcing total revenues were down 8.9% for the quarter. Sourcing net revenues decreased 2.5% for [Q3]. We\u2019ve talked throughout this year about a couple of things: that we had lost some committed business from a larger customer that we are cycling through, and that will continue through the remainder of this year. We hope it to end by the end of this year based on what we know today but we continue to work through that which is one of the primary reasons for the decline in total revenues.","We also have talked about some of the weather-related issues and some of the commodity challenges that we\u2019ve had and specific items that have created less margin for us and less opportunity due to freezes and floods in certain categories. What we experienced during Q3 this year is a return to a more normal net revenue margin of 7.6% which again is probably somewhere in the midrange of our longer-term margin expectations for this division. And that improvement in margin year-over-year is what led the net revenue decline to be less than our total revenues for the Sourcing Division.","That summarizes the comments on our net revenues and our activities by service line. With that I will turn it over to Chad for some comments on our income statement and other financial information.","Chad Lindbloom","Thanks, John. I\u2019ll begin my remarks on Slide 11 which is our summarized income statement. ","As John mentioned earlier, our total net revenues were up 14% and our operating income was up 15%. Even though we did achieve a little operating margin expansion our personnel expenses did grow faster than our net revenues. Our personnel expenses increased approximately 20% or $40 million. Approximately $30 million of the increase was caused by increased incentive compensation. Our total equity compensation was up $16 million and our cash and other incentive plans were up $14 million.","Our incentive compensation philosophy and plan stayed relatively consistent with previous years. The increase is based on our increased net revenue and earnings growth. Last year our incentives were extremely low due to our lack of earnings growth. Most of these plans are based on annual performance. If our earnings growth continues our personnel expense will likely continue to grow faster than net revenues for the remainder of the year.","The remaining $10 million of the increase was driven by approximately 2% average headcount increase compared to last year\u2019s Q3 and also increases in other personnel-related costs including slight salary increases. ","Our SG&A decreased 3.6%. This was primarily by reductions in claims expense and travel expense. Some of this reduction in travel was driven by less integration-related travel from the Phoenix acquisition. ","Moving on to Slide 12, we had a strong free cash flow quarter with cash provided by operations of $177 million and CapEx including investments in software of $6.3 million. Our debt balance dropped from $900 million at the end of Q2 to $845 million at the end of Q3 \u2013 again, this reduction in debt was driven by our strong cash flow.","Moving on to Slide 13, we are continuing our capital distribution methodology that we described at our Investor Day last November. Our goal is to distribute 90% of our net income to shareholders in most environments while maintaining our debt to EBITDA ratio in the range of 1.0 to 1.5 times. These distributions will vary based on our cash flow generation, needs for working capital and other capital needs. ","When you look at the table on Slide 13 you can see that we have a long track record of achieving this goal of cash distribution. During the quarter we paid $52.7 million in cash dividends and spent $76.8 million repurchasing shares. Our share repurchases tend to be more weighted towards the second half of the year which is when we tend to generate the bulk of our cash flow for the year.","With that I will turn it back to John for our closing prepared comments.","John Wiehoff","Okay, finishing off our prepared comments addressing Slide 14 and the bullet points around the look ahead and sharing some thoughts about our future. ","This quarter similar to the past when we think about Q4 or the upcoming quarter, the thing that we find the most helpful or correlating in our world is the North American Truckload net revenue metric which we shared to-date in October is up 13% per business day when compared to last year. So a couple of percentage points less than Q3 this year but very much in line with the same trend around double-digit net revenue growth and very modest volume growth.","About a year ago we also held an Investor Day in New York and we walked through at that point in time how we were thinking about our business from a strategy standpoint and from a long-term focus standpoint. When we look at the rest of this year and into next year our team believes that long-range plan and that investor deck that we shared a year ago still remains very valid. For those of you who weren\u2019t there or want to be refreshed by it, it is still available at www.chrobinson.com under the Investor Deck.","I just want to highlight a few of the things that we talked about a year ago and that we still believe to be true in our business that will impact us in Q4 as well as 2015 and beyond. A lot of discussion over the last several years about the fact that our business is impacted by both business cycles and secular change in our industry and that it\u2019s very difficult to quantify any of those individual variables, and that it\u2019s very easy to confuse the two because the impacts are oftentimes blended together.","So while we did have some nice margin expansion during the quarter it is our expectation that those business cycles of supply and demand, particularly in Truckload, will continue to happen and that our margins will continue to fluctuate in future periods in a way that are very difficult to predict.","In a lot of ways we think it\u2019s our primary mission to not only manage our business but to help our customers manage through both those shorter-term cycles as well as the longer-term secular changes that are happening. ","We do have a lot of interaction with customers and shareholders throughout the quarter where we have talked about the changes in the Truckload industry and the fact that today in some ways there\u2019s less surge capacity or less flexibility in the existing capacity than there has been in many previous periods. The fact that driver shortages and regulatory changes and supply chains maybe shortening in some instances rather than expanding \u2013 there\u2019s a combination of cyclical and secular changes that are still going on, particularly in the Truckload sector, that will continue to impact our results.","So our core message a year ago was that while things are changing and while there are a lot of things happening in our industry and in the marketplace we did tap down our long-term expectations from a 15% target to a double-digit EPS growth expectation. But I think the deck that\u2019s out there does a nice job of explaining why we still believe there\u2019s good market share and good long-term opportunity in the services that we offer.","A couple of the other things that are important that I want to reaffirm is that it is very important in our long-term strategy that we take market share. I touched on this in the Truckloads sector, that we have always had a strategy of adapting to market conditions and working with our customers to do what\u2019s right for them and what\u2019s right for Robinson at the same time; but over a long period of time it is very important in all of the services. It is our goal to grow and to take share, and that will continue to be a long-term foundation of how we hold ourselves accountable.","We also will continue to invest in new services and expand aggressively where we see the right opportunity. I commented earlier that after 20 years of offering Global Forwarding services we made a significant investment to more than double our presence in the Global Forwarding division, and two years into that we feel that that\u2019s been a very good investment and will continue to be very positive for our customers and for the Robinson shareholders.","Expanding and strengthening our network \u2013 we do have a lot of initiatives in North America and around the world to better optimize what we\u2019re doing, whether it\u2019s determining how to best consolidate or route freight or how to improve transit times for our customers, or to make revenue more available for some of the capacity providers that we work with. ","So those are some of the keys. The last bullet point that I want to touch on though is the last bullet point on Slide 14, talking about our team and our talent a little bit as we head into the remainder of \u201914 and 2015. ","I commented in the past and we\u2019ve talked today about our personnel increases and where we\u2019re at. As we came into 2014 there were several relevant metrics that kind of shaped our thinking coming into this year. If you look at our three largest divisions within the North American surface trans we had for about a three- or four-year period of time in a very balanced market, had been hiring talent at a slightly greater rate of increase than our volume had increased. And volume is the key metric that we correlate a lot of our headcount and talent needs over time.","So while we are proud of our industry-leading efficiency and feel like we were doing a good job we also know that we had been adding people fairly aggressively and that we were coming into a period of time where, with a harsh winter last year and significant changes in prices, that perhaps it was a prudent way to think about coming into 2015 to leverage some of the experienced talent that we had to serve our customers and be a little less aggressive at going after market share when there were significant market changes going on in the North America Truckload market.","We also knew in our Global Forwarding Division that throughout this integration period that we had done all we could to retain all of the original employees from Phoenix and our legacy Forwarding business and that it had been and still is our goal over time to leverage those resources and to become more efficient over time as we improve our processes and become more one network. So similar to the previous year we felt like there was enough talent and leadership in our Global Forwarding Division that we could go for 2014 without having to add a lot of additional investment.","And then in our third largest division in the Sourcing, we talked about the lost business that was there. So all of those things when you add them up, our leadership guidance and our direction coming into 2014 was that we felt for this year that we could manage ourselves and drive our results without needing to add a lot of talent to our team \u2013 which is what you see in our results for the first three quarters of this year.","It has never been our long-term strategy to shrink headcount. If you look at that long-term plan that I referenced that is available out there we talk about people being the foundation of our business. It\u2019s a service organization \u2013 that absolutely remains true. I think if you look at every successful company in our industry they are adding people to drive growth and we continue to expect to do the same thing.","So we\u2019re very proud of our results for the quarter. We think we have the best team in the industry and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in that team throughout the remainder of this year and next year, where longer-term we do expect that our headcount growth and our personnel costs will grow in line with our volume and market share gains. We have a lot of productivity initiatives and things that we hope to do to continue to grow our earnings a little faster and try to improve that in the future but at the core of creating long-term value is investing in that team and making sure that we maintain our competitive advantage of an industry-leading position by having the best team that\u2019s out there.","Those are our prepared comments. With that I will turn it over to Tim to take us through some of the questions that have been submitted.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Tim Gagnon ","Thanks, John. So first I\u2019d like to just take a minute to thank all of the analysts and investors for taking the time yesterday afternoon and last evening to submit some strong questions. And we\u2019ve bundled them or categorized them this morning and John or Chad will respond to some questions that I\u2019ll ask them and we\u2019ll get right into that right away here.","So the first question is for John and it\u2019s picking up on the topic that you just spoke about and that is headcount. So the question reads \u201cWhy was ending headcount down 103 people sequentially and what can we expect going forward? How long can we expect headcount to grow slower than volumes and\/or net revenues? And which is more important \u2013 headcount, volume, shipments or net revenues?\u201d","John Wiehoff","So I did weave some of these into my prepared comments but I\u2019ll reiterate them again because I do think they\u2019re fairly important messages, that over a long period of time our investment in talent and people, headcount, will correlate more with shipment volume across literally all of our services; and that adding that talent is a very important growth driver for us that we will be focused on for the remainder of this year and into 2015. ","As I mentioned we have a lot of different initiatives to try to continue to make ourselves more productive and as Chad laid out our variable compensation programs are structured to try to keep our business model in line when our rate of growth of when we add the people varies a little bit.","Tim Gagnon","Okay, thanks John. And the second question\u2019s for Chad and it\u2019s on the topic of personnel: \u201cHow should we think about personnel costs going forward given the increase of 19% this quarter primarily tied to variable compensation and increase in the accrual of compensation and profit sharing?\u201d","Chad Lindbloom","Yeah, I covered this in some detail in my prepared remarks and John mentioned it earlier. It is important to realize that most of our incentive compensation plans are annual plans, and many of these plans are based not only on earnings but growth in earnings. So when you look at last year, profit sharing and some other expenses \u2013 bonus growth pools \u2013 were at zero. This year as we\u2019re experiencing growth those plans are accruing some expense and some future benefits for our employees.","Because of this our personnel expense is growing faster than net revenue. If our earnings growth continues that will also continue to be the case in Q4 2014. Looking forward to 2015 the year as a whole, if we grow at about the same rate for the year as we grew this year personnel expense and net revenue should grow closer together. However, Q1 2014 we didn\u2019t have a lot of earnings growth so you could continue to see personnel expenses increasing at a faster rate than net revenue in Q1 2015.","Tim Gagnon","Okay, thanks Chad. The next question is for John. Any change to your long-term growth rate targets?","John Wiehoff","This speaks to the earlier comments around yes, a year ago we did tamp down those long-term growth targets from 15% to double-digit EPS growth but in terms of what we laid out a year ago around believing that we can take market share and continue to create long-term shareholder value through double-digit EPS growth. I think we feel very confident that those targets are still valid goals for us to have.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. The next question for Chad: should we expect a return to a 38% tax rate in Q4?","Chad Lindbloom","Our expected tax rate that we\u2019ve communicated in the past is 38.5% to 39.0%. Obviously it was lower this quarter with the $5 million foreign tax credit that was generated through a complex set of situations but basically by repatriating some foreign earnings generated some tax deductions this quarter. So 38.5% to 39.0% is what we believe our normalized ongoing tax rate should be.","Tim Gagnon","And a follow-up question about tax for Chad: were the tax credits received in Q3 something that will continue in the coming quarters? Or were they one-time in nature?","Chad Lindbloom","I don\u2019t want to call them one-time but they\u2019re unusual and will be infrequent. And as I just mentioned it was a set of pretty unique circumstances that generated such a large foreign tax credit during Q3.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. For John this next question related to Truckload volumes: growth year-over-year in the North American Truckload market moderated by 200 basis points from Q2 as was represented by cash shipments as well, and CHRW followed that trend. However with so many shippers apparently turning to brokers one might expect CHRW\u2019s Truckload volume growth to exceed the overall truckload market. Is CHRW under-growing the market because of selectivity and what business you take on or capacity constraints in the market?","John Wiehoff","I think this question speaks to the challenge of sorting out both longer-term secular and shorter-term cyclical issues that we have woven into our business. As I commented earlier we have adapted to market conditions that have had us re-pricing a lot of our freight and we do believe that our approach to changes in the market has impacted our volume growth this year. So yes, the short-term market cycles and how we\u2019re approaching the market we do believe has impacted our volume growth in the current year.","The comment about more shippers turning to brokers and being more receptive to 3PL providers, we do believe that to be the case. And in those long-term goals that I referenced several times earlier one of the things that does give us longer-term confidence that we can continue to take share and create value in the long term is that trend, that we think the 3PL model does have more and more applicability and shippers are more receptive to it. And that is part of what will enable us to be successful in the long term.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question for Chad: are you experiencing an improvement because of your ability to re-price contracted volumes higher? And this related to negative loads \u2013 are you seeing an improvement in your negative loads?","Chad Lindbloom","Okay, Tim. Our negative loads or loser loads are down sequentially compared to last quarter and they\u2019re also down year-over-year compared to Q3 last year. All these quarters I referenced are in the high-single digits which is higher than our normalized loser loads. When we look at history it\u2019s closer to mid-single digits so I think there\u2019s still some room to go. The improvement, yes, is based on the changes in the marketplace which have allowed us to raise prices or provided us opportunities to raise prices more than we did in previous quarters.","Tim Gagnon","Okay, next question for John: can you elaborate on the cross-selling benefits you are seeing from the Phoenix integration, highlighting any wins and talk to the drivers of strong international air and ocean margins? We\u2019re trying to understand what impact if any procurement synergies are having on the results.","John Wiehoff","When we acquired Phoenix two years ago one of the very first things that we focused on because it\u2019s required essentially is the combination of the service contracts and creating greater scale by putting the combined business together. And that was one of the first-year successes around seeing some improved pricing around the combined contracting.","There are a lot of things as you know that impact the margins around how you route the freight, how you distribute it across those contracts, how you consolidate it. And a lot of the things that we continue to work on this year and into the future do continue to have an impact on our cost structure and on our margins around how efficient we are in routing the freight and how effective we can be in generating a margin with that.","So the procurement side has had an impact on synergies. Some of it was in year one and some of it continues depending upon sort of how you break down your view towards the cost structure and what we\u2019re doing. The benefits of cross-selling go more to the customer side that I talked about earlier. ","We do believe that we have very strong customer relationships in North America, and as I mentioned for twenty years we\u2019ve been selling Global Forwarding services in the North American marketplace. But in those bids that we participate in like every other service they are very competitive and there are other providers, and it comes down to price and service capabilities. ","And we\u2019ve had more success recently cross-selling our services and we think it\u2019s from the improved pricing and service capabilities that we\u2019ve developed over the last couple of years; and we\u2019re going to just continue to focus in on that and drive more and more of our account management relationships to take a look at opportunities where we can get involved in international freight as well.","Tim Gagnon","Thank you, John. A technology question for Chad: what is the status of the Navisphere rollout? How far along in the process are you domestically and internationally? Have you given guidance on what level of operating efficiency improvement you expect this system could deliver?","Chad Lindbloom","As John mentioned in his prepared remarks we have a significant amount of work done on the integration of Phoenix onto our Navisphere platform but there is still work ongoing into 2015. In early- or mid-2015 we will be at a point where 95% plus of our net revenues are running through our Navisphere systems from a financial and an online visibility perspective. Future initiatives will include trying to further integrate and improve some of the functionality within Navisphere to make the system even better both in foreign locations as well as domestic.","As far as the guidance on productivity, no, we really haven\u2019t given it any guidance and it\u2019s really been happening on an ongoing basis because we have continuous release throughout the year that we pick up a little bit of the incremental value as we go. So we\u2019re not able to really quantify what we expect the future productivity pickups to be and when they will occur.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, Chad. The next question also for you related to margin: 2014 has been an unusual year with respect to Transportation gross margins as they have risen on a percentage basis through the year. Is 16.1% an appropriate placeholder for 2015? Do you believe gross margins can continue to expand sequentially in Q4 as they have expanded sequentially since troughing at 14.9% in Q3 2013?","Chad Lindbloom","Yeah, I would refer you back to Slide 4 which shows you a ten-year history of our Transportation net revenues by quarter and by year. And when you look back there you\u2019ll see that usually Q1 is the highest quarter for total Transportation net revenue. 2014 was unusual to have it be the lowest and that had to do with the market dynamics and cyclicality. If you look when the market finally shifted and demand started to increase relative to supply you\u2019ll see that we did return to what we would consider a more normal, or the, as John mentioned we\u2019re roughly at the \u201caverage\u201d of our net revenue margins.","So what will they do in the future? The market will be a big part of determining that but is 16.1% a good estimate? I\u2019d say it\u2019s at the midpoint but what happens next year would more depend on what happens in the marketplace.","Tim Gagnon","Okay, thanks Chad. Next question for John: the publicly traded truckload carriers signaled in their Q3 conference calls and releases that continued tightness in truck capacity and an otherwise strong demand environment. Are you experiencing similar outcomes and can you talk a bit about how these market fundamentals are impacting the truckload brokerage market?","John Wiehoff","Throughout all of this year we have continued to see the truck market conditions be a little bit tighter than what we had seen over the previous three or four years prior to that. We do believe and agree with a lot of the truckload providers that are being referenced here that if you look at the underlying cost structure and demographics of the trucking industry, the driver shortage is a very real thing, the new equipment costs a lot more. ","There is a lot of cost pressure in the industry, so in that difficult-to-predict assessment of supply and demand and where pricing will go, assuming demand stays stable or increases we do believe that truckload pricing is going to continue to have pressure on it and will continue to rise under the current environment.","How is that impacting the truckload brokerage market? As I said earlier, shippers are very focused and we are very focused today on having appropriate plans for your known freight or your committed freight, because planning is as big a premium as ever to make sure that in a tight market you\u2019ve got the capacity that you need secured. It also means that where there is surge freight or unexpected freight or transactional opportunities that it\u2019s generally at a much higher price than a committed or a contracted shipment would be in today\u2019s market.","So one of the effects of what\u2019s happening is it\u2019s creating a premium on planning and that\u2019s one of the primary ways that we\u2019re working with our customers more aggressively is to make sure that lead times and route guides are well established and that commitments are understood and worked with; and doing the best we can to try to serve incremental needs when additional capacity typically has a pretty significant premium to it.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. The next question again for you: how should we think about your plan to build out a European Union truckload operation in light of the disappointing macro data from the region? Are you less interested now or are you looking to invest counter-cyclically to be positioned better once the region gets on track? When do you think this business could become a meaningful contributor to growth and how should we think about the eventual margin profile?","John Wiehoff","A lot of good questions in there. For starters we would validate the notion that macro data in Europe does translate into some more difficult conditions in the trucking market. It has been pretty difficult the last couple of years with a lot of declining prices and declining demand on the truckload side in a lot of the parts of Europe but especially in Western Europe. Combining that with a lot of lower-cost capacity coming in from the East and supply chains changing it is a pretty difficult environment to grow the business right now.","We have not changed our long-term commitment. We\u2019ve been at it for a little over twenty years and we do continue to invest in building our European surface transportation business by opening offices and by hiring salespeople and going after building a presence in the market. We have backed off a little bit in our rate of some of those activities just to make sure that we\u2019re investing proportionate to kind of the market demand that is there.","From a margin standpoint I think we\u2019ve been very open that while we\u2019re profitable in Europe, with the scale of the business relative to the overhead and the investment that we have today it\u2019s not anywhere near kind of the North American profitability metrics. So our goal is to continue to invest even in a difficult time, position ourselves to build out our network for better growth periods so that we can be in a good spot to take advantage of the market condition when they turn; but be prudent along the way to make sure that we\u2019re building a strong foundation and being responsible with our expenses along the way.","Tim Gagnon","Thank you, John. Next question for Chad: did your Truckload length of haul continue to shrink in Q3?","Chad Lindbloom","Yes it did, both sequentially and compared to last year\u2019s Q3. Last year\u2019s Q3 our length of haul is down about 4%. We believe our length of haul is shortening more than the market is as a total, and the primary driver of that is our fastest-growing volume segment is freight of 500 miles or less. A lot of that freight is coming with the increased integrated relationships that John mentioned earlier.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks Chad, the next question for John. In prior communication CHRW has targeted 2.5 times debt to EBITDA for the right acquisition. Under what conditions if any would CHRW consider a purchase that would either be dilutive or exceed this leverage threshold?","John Wiehoff","We haven\u2019t really talked about or explored anything today that would have us thinking that way. I think like any company you probably have to stay open minded to it if the right sort of opportunity came along that we felt could really create value in the long term but in the short term would be more dilutive. It could possibly be a technology business or something that had less revenue or earnings today but had a very positive impact on us, or some competitive threat that was more of a defensive move I think could be likely scenarios where we might consider thinking about different valuation parameters. ","But the foundation of our thinking has been and remains today that if we have confidence in our plan which we do then we can create long-term shareholder value by growing primarily organically with some investments that are valued properly and thoroughly integrated into our global network \u2013 that that\u2019s what our growth strategy will be.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question is a capital allocation question for Chad: you haven\u2019t raised the dividend since Q4 2012. Q4 2013 was the first Q4 you hadn\u2019t raised it since 2007. What can we expect in Q4 \u201914 and when will we hear a definitive announcement?","Chad Lindbloom","We\u2019ve talked about for quite a long time now that our dividend payout ratio target is 45%. And you\u2019re right, we do tend to raise the dividend for the Q4 dividend. The reason why it didn\u2019t go up last year is because our earnings didn\u2019t grow. As we look forward to this year, Q4 of this year, we will be reviewing our dividend again at the Q4 Board meeting and the announcement of what our dividend will be for Q4 of this year will be in early December.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, Chad. Next question for John: in Truck what was the mix of contractual business versus spot in Q3 and how does that compare to Q3 \u201913?","John Wiehoff","This is a question that we get often and the way we have answered it remains valid, that compared to some truckload providers or maybe even some other 3PLs in our world there\u2019s not a clear definitional break between contractual and spot market type business. We have a wide variety of commitments and contracts, so we can generalize about it but it\u2019s really hard to put percentages on it. ","We get a lot of incremental freight from our contractual relationships, and we get a lot of pre-priced opportunities where even though it may be considered spot market freight there are existing quotes out there and the freight will move along those existing prices until there\u2019s a change in the marketplace \u2013 but there\u2019s no real firm commitment to do that.","From a generalizing standpoint what we talked about from really 2010 all the way through 2013 last year, that our business was moving towards more and more contracted or committed relationships. The changes this year have resulted in a slightly greater mix of our freight being priced more frequently or fluidly into what we would classify as spot market. ","Longer-term our estimate had always been that we were roughly 50\/50 in terms of a mix of freight and that during that four-year period of time up until a year ago that we were trending higher than that \u2013 maybe 60\/40 or 70\/30; and that this year it\u2019s probably trending somewhere back closer to a more balanced view. But again that all depends upon your definition and categorization of what\u2019s contracted or what\u2019s committed versus what is a true spot market opportunity.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question again for you related to Intermodal: does the extremely tight driver situation make you more or less interested in increasing your Intermodal presence? Intermodal has obviously had some real challenges with the rail service issues so how is this impacting your business and your thoughts on becoming a more active player in this space? Are you more interested in acquiring an existing player to quickly establish an existing presence or leaning more towards building it on your own?","John Wiehoff","I would say that in general over the last three or four years with the changes that have gone on in both the truckload and rail industry, that our appetite for Intermodal is probably greater than it was even three or four years ago. It has always been an important part of our portfolio but particularly in those longer length of hauls and increasing fuel prices and other things like that from just a long-term strategy standpoint, Intermodal is as important as it\u2019s ever been \u2013 maybe slightly more important than versus several years ago.","You know, the current environment around railroad service issues and some of the pain that comes with the lessened efficiency of assets that you owned and the way that you can serve your customers in this environment points out some of the risk of the business model that it takes to be larger and drive scale advantages in Intermodal. So from the standpoint of building it ourselves we feel like we have done a nice job of improving our operations and becoming more efficient and serving our customers. Growth has been the more challenging part because every time you grow your network you have to either invest in some more boxes or look at how you\u2019re going to do things differently to try to drive that growth.","So I would say we\u2019re mixed or neutral as to whether organic growth or acquisition is the right path to go. We\u2019ve been wrestling with that for a while and it just kind of comes down to perpetually looking at the opportunities that exist and trying to make a decision on which path forward will help us grow better.","Tim Gagnon","One more for you here, John, on LTL: one of the larger LTL carriers talked about increasing 3PL blanket rates in a similar fashion to the general rate increases. What type of an impact on net revenue margin would this have on your business?","John Wiehoff","So almost all of the larger LTL carriers that we deal with we do have what\u2019s called a general rate tariff or a general pricing for customers of all different sorts and classes. And as I mentioned earlier when those LTL providers do do general rate increases they apply to general rate tariffs or 3PL blanket rates \u2013 I guess the way the question was phrased would apply to us as well, too.","So that\u2019s very similar to any other Transportation offering that we have. When our cost of hire goes up that impact on us is that if we do nothing we have some margin compression. If we\u2019re able to pass that along to our customer we can keep our margin stable by passing that through in the marketplace. ","Because a lot of our larger LTL customers do have customer-specific pricing with some of the LTL carriers it\u2019s a little bit easier on the LTL side that I mentioned earlier to make sure that rates adjust simultaneously or at least close to each other, so there\u2019s probably just a little bit less volatility in our LTL margin fluctuations at least for some of those larger accounts. ","But it happens in greater volume versus a single truckload shipment at a time, but basically it works like those other modes where when we get those price increases we have to react to them and see if that causes any changes to our routing or how we might service that account; or if it\u2019s an increase that we have to consider trying to pass along to the customer and if so, can we do that.","Tim Gagnon","The next question is for Chad: overall gross operating margins are holding at 38% level from CH standalone in the 40%s. As you noted there would be more pressure with a more people-intensive business. Would you expect these levels to hold or could they accrete as you gain synergies?","Chad Lindbloom","Right, just some background on that. We talked a lot about when we acquired Phoenix, Phoenix\u2019s operating income to net revenue was kind of at the industry gold standard or benchmark of 30% operating income to net revenue. In round numbers, that\u2019s 10% lower than Robinson prior to Phoenix operating income to net revenue. Phoenix was about 10% the size of Robinson so that\u2019s 1% dilution right there, and there\u2019s also about a 1% dilution from the increased amortization expense for deal-related intangibles that came with the Phoenix acquisition.","So that reconciles from 40% to 38%. I do believe that in most operating environments this 38% is attainable to continue to generate. And if I refer again back to our investor presentation at our Investor Day last November, if you look at our expected growth rates for net revenue and operating income they are the same. So there is definitely increased competition. ","Our net revenue margins going forward will also impact that operating income to net revenue, but generally going forward we expect the two to grow together. However, we are managing for efficiency every day and looking for ways to improve that metric.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, Chad. Next question is for John related to competition: can you discuss the current competitive environment in the truck brokerage market and are you concerned about other participants being able to do the same business for a significantly smaller margin going forward?","John Wiehoff","One of the longer-term changes that we\u2019ve talked about over the last several years is the recognition that the space has become more competitive. There\u2019s specific examples of new competitors that exist today that didn\u2019t exist five years ago and the challenge for us is to manage that incremental competition with what we also believe is increased opportunity with shippers and a greater acceptance to the 3PL and brokerage market that exists out there. ","So it is more competitive. It will remain more competitive. We do believe that some of those newer competitors have been very aggressive about going after market share with less focus on profitability and willing to accept less margin than we have been able to earn historically. Obviously they may be able to do that for a shorter period of time or I don\u2019t know how sustainable it will be. ","We also believe that we have some pretty meaningful competitive advantages with our scale and our technology and some things that we can continue to leverage. But it does put pressure on us to stay that industry leader and to continue to invest and be smart about what we do and make sure that we\u2019re pricing competitively with our customers to make sure that we continue to grow with them, too.","So yes, it\u2019s a concern. It\u2019s been around for a couple of years now and I think we\u2019re reacting to it, and hopefully it\u2019ll be something that we can manage successfully going forward.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question for Chad around the tax rate: why did you state that the lower tax rate year-over-year helped EPS by $0.03? The difference between 36.6% and last year\u2019s 38.0% was approximately $2.8 million and divided into the shares it seems like $0.02 and not $0.03.","Chad Lindbloom","Okay. Last year\u2019s 38% was slightly lower than our overall expected tax rate so you\u2019re comparing it to what was a lower base. The way that we calculated the $0.03 is the actual tax benefits that we believe were unusual were $5 million. That divided by our share count is $0.03.","Tim Gagnon","Okay, thanks Chad. Next question for John: how do you balance use of cash and paying down debt versus buying back stock? Given the change in the market demand would you consider further acquisition candidates or not at this time?","John Wiehoff","We are very much open to looking at acquisitions at this point in time. We are actively looking. As I said before we believe that we\u2019re appropriate in having a more selective approach, to make sure that we do the right sort of deals at the right price and make sure that we grow our business in the long-term stable way.","In terms of what do we do with our cash, we added that capital management strategy slide to the deck just to sort of reemphasize that our capital management philosophy has been to essentially through dividends and share repurchases distribute whatever we generate every year regardless of or above and beyond any acquisitions that we do. ","Because of the fact that if you go back five years on that slide we had accumulated some cash that what you see beyond our ongoing annual distribution plan is the fact that we did distribute some of that excess cash. And then last year through our ASR transaction we swung to somewhere around 1x turn of debt that we added to the balance sheet. ","So the way we\u2019re managing things today is assuming that level of debt that we\u2019re carrying will remain rather stable and just going on with our normal policy that Chad articulated about the 90% current year earnings distribution target, we would consider changing that leverage ratio and that amount of debt for the right type of acquisition that comes along. And we are actively looking for something like that at this point in time.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question is for Chad: depreciation expense declined sequentially. How should we be thinking about this? Is this a trend you expect to continue in Q4?","Chad Lindbloom","Okay, that question is the combination of depreciation and amortization I believe, and the sequential decline has to do with some acquisition-related intangibles that were acquired and being amortized. Those acquisitions happened between five and seven years ago and the amortization expense for certain intangible assets did end. So yes, that lower amount will continue.","In addition there is another acquisition-related intangible from five years ago that ended during the quarter, and that will reduce next quarter by about $200,000. Those are just the impacts of those specific acquisition amortizations. Obviously depreciation amortization will fluctuate as we acquire and add new assets and retire old assets.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, Chad. And the last question here is for John related to Sourcing: when do you expect the year-over-year negative impacts of your large customer in Sourcing to abate?","John Wiehoff","I might have mentioned this earlier but we do know and anticipate that in Q4 of this year, that we will have some continuing comparison challenges for that business cycling out. From what we know of today we hope to have a fresh start into 2015 and be able to return to more normal growth activity. We win and lose every day so hopefully that\u2019ll be the case when we come into 2015 but we know for sure that there\u2019s at least one more quarter of some comparison challenges.","Tim Gagnon","Okay, thanks John and Chad. That takes us to the end of the hour here and we\u2019re out of time. Unfortunately we weren\u2019t able to get to all of the questions today and we really appreciate the submissions that were made.

Wiehoff - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President","Chad M. Lindbloom - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Senior Vice President","Operator","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the C.H. Robinson Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, August 6, 2013.","Now I would like to turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, the Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Gagnon","Thank you, Vince, and thank you -- and on our call today will be John Wiehoff, our Chief Executive Officer and Chad Lindbloom, our Chief Financial Officer. John and Chad will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our second quarter and will follow that up with the response to pre-submitted questions that we've received after our earnings release this afternoon. If time allows -- I'm sorry, I was going to comment about opening up to live questions but with the number questions that we received, it's likely that it will be difficult for us to get to live questions. We also will be referencing prepared slides as part of the call today. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Chad will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments.","I'd like to remind you that the comments made by John and Chad or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","Before I turn it over to John, I'd like to reiterate a couple of changes in the earnings release on the slide deck. First, we've separate our truckload and less-than-truckload services to provide more detail to the area we formerly called truck. We've also provided a schedule with historical perspective for LTL and truckload revenues as well as for customs, which was formerly bundled in the other logistics services line. That historical reference can be found in the Appendix C in the slide deck, the very last slide in the deck.","Also with the impact of our purchase of Phoenix International and the divestiture of T-Chek in 2012, and similar to our quarter 1 earnings release, we have provided pro forma financial measures for net revenue and income from operations to provide meaningful insight and an alternative perspective of our results of operations. We believe that these pro forma financial measures reflect an additional way of analyzing aspects of our ongoing operations that, when viewed with our actual results, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business.","A reconciliation of actual results to pro forma numbers is provided in appendix A and B at the end of the slide deck.","With that, I'll turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments on Slide 3 with a review of our quarter 2, 2013 results.","John P. Wiehoff","Thank you, Tim, and thanks, everyone, who's taken time to listen to the call today. As Tim suggested, on Page 3, we've got our enterprise results for the second quarter of 2013. For our total revenues, the increase for the quarter 11.3% to 3.2 [Audio Gap] both the income from operations and the earnings per share decreased a little over 1%. If you look at total revenues for the year-to-date for the first 2 quarters, they increased 14.1% to $6.2 billion. If you look at our gross revenue increase for the first half of the year, we increased roughly $775 million and we're reasonably happy with our top-line revenue performance and our market share gains, about half of that revenue growth came from acquired revenue and about half came from organic growth. Similar to the quarter, year-to-date both income from operations and earnings-per-share were down, rounded 1% down, and we're obviously less happy with our ability to increase our earnings off of those revenue and market share gains. Also on the first page, it highlights that we did have a auto liability settlement of $5 million in the second quarter that impacted our EPS by $0.02 a share.","Turning to Page 4, as Tim mentioned, we have prepared pro forma results, given the materiality of the Phoenix acquisition and T-Chek divestiture from last year, and because of the fact that the Phoenix business is being aggressively integrated and is already being operated as one combined global forwarding business within C.H. Robinson, the only meaningful way to really create a pro forma analysis is to adjust to the prior year information to include the historical Phoenix information in it and to adjust out T-Chek from the history. So if you look on Page 4, what it is showing is our actual 2013 information that includes operating income of $182 million and it shows our actual 2012 information of $184 million of operating income and then adjusts that for T-Chek and Phoenix, as I described. If you look at the far right-hand column for the percentage change based on the pro forma information, what we believe you should take away and we believe this schedule is showing, is that adjusted in this pro forma fashion for the ongoing operations, our net revenue grew at 3.1%. And as you see in the 2 columns below that, the expenses grew faster, both personnel and SG&A. We'll talk separately about those. The SG&A line item of $79 million for the current year includes the $5 million charge related to the accident. If you adjust that out of the current year, the percentage increase gets to be between 6% and 7%. So the schedule, from our analysis, is showing that net revenue is up a little over 3% and both personnel and SG&A expenses are up in the 5% to 6% range. So we will make comments about our expenses growing faster than our revenues and that's sort of our frame of reference for looking at it. The top line of that is that from a personnel standpoint, we did increase our hiring. Our headcount growth, outside of the pro forma transactions that we discussed, were in the range of 8% and its largely reflective of additional bodies into our North American network. Primarily for salespeople, to grow our business and to go after gains. Our cost per employee did decline, which is why the personnel expenses are up 5.6% on a pro-forma basis and that really is reflective of our business model and the variable expense nature, that when we don't grow our earnings, the compensation is automatically reduced. So you see the personnel expense increase being a little bit less than the headcount increase.","So those are the comments on Page 4 for the adjusted earnings. Page 5 does the same thing for the year-to-date adjustments around Phoenix and T-Chek. We don't have any prepared comments on Page 5 because the year-to-date numbers and comments would be very similar.","Turning to Page 6 then, moving into the analysis for the quarter around the transportation results, this is the chart that we've been showing, for total transportation revenue of $2.8 billion and net revenue margin of 15.3% for the quarter and then down below, you see the 10-year history by quarter of the transportation net revenue margins.","In the past, we've covered the 6 or 7 items that influenced the net revenue margins, from the market conditions to fuel, to many other things. One of the things we've talked about is the mix factors. When we look at the results for the second quarter of 2013, the 15.3 or really this whole year, the mix issue is going to be more significant in our net revenue margins. And for the second quarter, the global forwarding net revenue constitutes 18% of the transportation net revenues versus only 8.5 last year. So there is a pretty meaningful mix change. As we go through the results by Service Line, we have the directional comments for each of them around what's a contributing increase or decrease to the net revenue margin percentage. So the mix is a big deal but it is, as we talked in our last call, the increase for the quarter is reflective of some stabilization in the North American truck margins like we talked about.","So then, moving to Page 7 into the truckload results for Q2 of 2013. Our truckload net revenue for the quarter increased 3.2%. Again, our pro forma numbers for the quarter were 3.1% of net revenue growth. So you can see that truckload, being the largest category, is the principal driver of that. As you see for the enterprise, the volume growth was 9%, 4% of that growth coming from -- or 4% growth coming from the acquisition of Apreo, where there's a much higher volume increase of short-haul freight. Our pricing increase is 1% for the quarter and both year-to-date. And on an enterprise basis, the net revenue margin declining, but as you see on the note below, for the North American truckload portion of it, it was flat for the second quarter of this year compared to last year. So what you're seeing is at our European business, which represents about 4% of our net revenue and about 7% of our volume, that, that volume increase contributes pretty meaningful. Because the North America volume was 5% increase and the Europe, adding it up with 4%, to a total of 9%. And the margins on that lower length of haul freight in Europe leading to the overall decline with North America being flat.","One other comment about the 1% rate increase, again as you see in the bullet point, for the quarter, in North America, we had about a 1% price increase to our customers as well as a 1% increase in the cost of hire. And we've talked about this before but just as a reminder, we do not have any centralized tariffs, that 1% rate increase is a combination or a byproduct of thousands of tariffs across the network. I would say that almost every rate in our system has been rebid or relooked at within the last 12 months. Many of the rates have stayed constant with a common theme of customers trying to hold rates stable. Others have increased -- the 1% just becomes the mix or the byproduct of all of the different pricing decisions across all of our network. The other comment I would make with regards to trends, and there were a lot of questions submitted around this as well. When we analyze our truckload business for the quarter, and net revenue margins being relatively flat, we do continue to see a meaningful trend in towards what we refer to as the balanced market, where the supply and demand relationship is pretty static and freight is moving as planned by our customers. We can see that by metrics that we track, things like a very high route guide compliance, where we're involved and understand that the preplanning and bidding of the freight, that the freight is moving very much in accordance to that. We also can see a pretty meaningful dissipation of surge freight or transactional freight, both within our larger dedicated customers, where through business reviews and seasonal mapping of the freight flows, we can see that there is less surge freight or peak freight this year than in previous years. As well as less transactional business from smaller customers as well. So the trend that we've been talking about for the last couple of years about a balanced market, heavy focus on cost containment and cost control by shippers and elimination of unplanned or transactional freight is a trend that we did continue to see during the quarter.","Turning to Slide 8 then for the LTL results. Net revenues increased 7.6%. See the directional trends of pricing increase and net margin decrease as well. For pricing within LTL, as we've commented in the past, we work off a number of different tariffs that are priced in a variety of ways. So it's difficult to quantify precisely, but there is generally a small trend upwards in pricing for the quarter as well as the year-to-date and a slight net revenue margin decrease for both the quarter and year-to-date. Volumes grew at approximately 8% and again, when we look across our customer base, what we see is a much more meaningful increase in the larger, more contracted or planned freight customers and less growth in the transactional customers for the quarter.","Moving to Page 9 in the deck, around our intermodal net revenue results. The intermodal net revenue decreased 1% for the quarter with net margin improving for the second quarter in intermodal and pricing being relatively flat. Similar to the comments in the truck market, we did see a decline in what we would classify as transactional customers or transactional freight that moved by rail. In the intermodal area, for our business, that can be a combination of rail pricing and decisions that they've made around what types of market share or pricing they want to put out there. Along with, as we've discussed many times, our intermodal business tends to be more interchangeable with the truckload environment and with the availability and capacity, more of that transactional freight tends to move by truck than rail. As we've talked, we've been converting our intermodal business more towards higher volume, larger customers and the results for the quarter really show the continuation of that, with some lapping and some more stable net revenue margin but less volume growth due to the elimination of transactional freight.","Moving to Page 10, the Phoenix integration, there are and were a lot of questions about this and it is a very significant event going in -- on within our company. So I have, like last quarter, some more meaningful prepared comments on the Phoenix integration. Slide 10 is doing for our global forwarding business of air, ocean and customs, similar to the pro forma analysis earlier. It is taking the prior-year Phoenix net revenue of $46 million for the quarter and adding it in to our 2012 results and showing that on a pro-forma basis, as calculated this way, that our net revenue for the quarter in global freight forwarding was up 2%. As far as an update from our global forwarding from an integration standpoint, while that represents a fairly modest net revenue increase, we do feel very positive about the integration project and would classify it as being on track to deliver the returns that we're hoping for, and feel pretty good about things 8 months into it. That's kind of a brief recap of the integration plan and where we're at. In the first couple of quarters, the shorter-term focuses on synergies and putting the businesses together were around defining and deciding the combined management structure and which offices and leadership roles would be combined and those have all been completed. We do have a common structure for the business and feel good about our leadership team that's in place. We were successful in combining our service contracts or combining our buy volume and routing our freight in a joint way through the spring as the service contracts were negotiated. There are a number of accounts where we have combined account management structures that were put in place and, overall, we feel very good about retaining our customers, retaining our employees and having no meaningful service disruptions in the first 8 months of working together as a combined organization. In an acquisition like this, it can cause a lot of internal focus and competitors tend to go after the business more aggressively. And we feel very good about retaining the business, growing a little bit of market share in not a great environment and making the early decisions that we need to make to figure out what the combined organization is going to look like.","The meaningful parts of the integration that are still going on, and are going to continue to happen for quite some time, largely center around the technology conversion and the combination of both operating systems. As I've talked before, our approach to that is kind of a best of both from each of the businesses, where we're taking some of the technology capabilities and uniquenesses in the customer relationships and processes that exist in both businesses and combining them into our Navisphere platform, from a one common platform standpoint. Most of that gap closure has been identified and created. As the slides says, we've begun the technology transition that will happen office-by-office, and start with the simpler freight and finish next year with more complicated conversions around any customization or anything else that we need to do. I think one of the real important points that we've talked about a lot internally, we are putting a lot of resources and a lot of effort towards this integration and it is a really important part of redefining Robinson to a global platform.","I personally believe that what most companies would define as integration of an acquisition is largely complete within Robinson. And that our definition of integrating our global forwarding platform not only includes some of the typical integration challenges around leadership combinations and office combinations, but in our world, it's almost the equivalent of an ERP implementation as well. Because we're really looking at how every transaction flows through the system and remapping them and making sure that we convert all of the processes of both business to the most effective format. And getting on that common platform and really looking at that transaction flow, while it's taking a lot of resources and were spending a lot of effort to do it, that's what really sets up the second phase of synergies and approach around efficiencies and productivity and having all the information together to look better at consolidations and cross-selling and integrating our services across the network. We think we'll be in a position to start driving that more effectively next year. And again, our long-term goal being mid-single-digit net revenue increases and market share gains, and then utilizing cross-selling synergies and efficiency gains over the coming years to drive a double-digit growth that I described last time.","So the market environment is difficult. I know several others and there's been a lot of several industry data points about difficulties in the environment of global freight forwarding. We do see that it's a fairly weak market out there, but again, 8 months into it, we feel pretty good about what we've been able to accomplish and consider ourselves on track for realizing the return. A lot of people have asked and we've talked internally about the integration costs and trying to understand and quantify them better.","I think in addition to it being important that you understand we've taken this best-of-both approach, we've also really handled the integration expenses largely internally. And the best example that I can give you is, in addition to several million of hard dollars around travel and different expenses that we've incurred throughout the year, we do spend about $75 million annually on our IT department. And this has clearly been and will be the #1 priority of our IT department. There are a number people in that group that are solely dedicated to this. Almost everybody in the department is probably touching one aspect of it or another. But in our integrated platform, there's a lot of overlap between what are planned enhancements, what are integration efforts, dealing with things like security and different components of our system that there's an ongoing requirement but there's also something new from the integration. It really becomes difficult-to-impossible to identify what component of our spending is integration-related and we really just don't want to take the time or effort to have all of our people try to track that or break it down because it's so judgmental, I'm not sure it would be as helpful. But I do know that this is the biggest transformation initiative that we've ever undergone in my 20 years here and it's a really important component to how we're reestablishing ourselves in a global platform. And we're absorbing all of the costs associated with it and taking the beating for the spending that is occurring. But I feel very positive about the long-term investment that we're making and how this is going to position us for the future, both within global forwarding, as well as the platform that it's creating to integrate our services and really take the business and the portfolio of services to the next level.","From a timing standpoint, this project will go into next year, like I said. The office conversions happen one by one with a lot of training and implementation to make sure that there are no disruptions. During 2014, the costs will start to phase out, but it is a long-term project that's going to take the better part of 2 years to complete from start to finish.","So those are my comments on the integration project or process and where we're at. If you turn to Page 11, these represent the actual results for global forwarding for the year. As we've reported, the ocean, air and customs, you see the double-digit increases for all of those as the new business rolling in, with volume increases across the board. Price decreases in both air and ocean being reflective of the weak environment that I discussed earlier. And primarily on the ocean side, seeing the net revenue margin improvement for us on the combined business really being a byproduct of the early synergies that I discussed before around our combined global forwarding business.","Moving to Page 12. Our other logistics services represent a 14.8% net revenue increase for the quarter to $17 million and $34.2 million for the year. It includes primarily our transportation management services as the largest source of revenue. Similar to what we've commented on in other quarters, we continue to feel very good about our backlog of services and opportunities here. We do think that this will continue to provide probably the highest growth opportunity for Robinson. It really represents the way we think about our strategic plan and growth goals, that offering transportation services, truckload, less-than-truckload, intermodal and international. And then this really represents the logistics management or supply chain services beyond that around technology and consulting, generally fee-based services. We think this bodes well and is reflective of the long-term opportunity for 3PLs like us to continue to do more for customers. While the shipper attitudes of driving efficiencies and the balance of growth and efficiency being heavily skewed towards the efficiency side of things, while that puts margin pressure on the transportation offerings, it's also what creates the opportunity here from a logistic services standpoint.","And also, as I've mentioned in past sessions, while these services are relevant to our revenues and material, they also are tied to a significant portion of our transportation revenues through the joint accounts that we manage and that integrated service offering that we talk so much about, it is an important part of the foundation.","Page 13, the last of our service line, the sourcing results. See a net revenue decrease for the quarter of 3.6%. We don't talk about it a lot in the transportation area, but this is where our produce sourcing and distribution of fruits and vegetables. This is the revenue or the net revenue that's recognized on the product portion of that. For those of you who are familiar with the food patterns in the country, there was a very wet spring and there was a lot of disruption to different crops, particularly things like melons and tomatoes and seasonal vegetables. That impacts the total available crops and commodities that we can move and has us serve a lot of the dedicated business with the more limited product and eliminates some of the transactional opportunities. So our volume was up slightly, but weather-related margin compression resulted in a net revenue decrease of 3.6% for the quarter.","I'll turn it over to Chad at this point for some prepared comments on Slide 14 and the other financial information that's in the deck.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Okay, thanks, John. Moving to Slide 14, I will cover some information on our cash flow, balance sheet and capital structure. The second quarter of 2013 was a strong cash flow quarter. As you can see, year-to-date, the cash flow looks pretty low but it's important to remember, we talked about in the first quarter that we had an over $100 million income tax payment, which was a result of the divestiture of T-Chek last year.","Our capital expenditures are within the plan that we outlined earlier this year. We expect our total to be about $55 million, putting the construction of another office building on our Eden Prairie campus, which we will move our IT department into. They are currently at a leased facility that we will be terminating at the end of this year or early 2014. You can also see that we have continued our share repurchase activity during the quarter. We repurchased 872,225 shares at an average price of $57.26. When you look at our share repurchases and our dividends combined, year-to-date, we have returned about $259 million to shareholders. We expect to continue returning this capital to our shareholders with a target of 90% to 100% as we discussed on last quarter's call.","Thanks to our business model and the strong operating cash flows, we are able to return these levels of capital to our shareholders while maintaining the liquidity required to grow our business over time. We finished the quarter with $150 million in cash and $365 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility.","With that, I will turn it back to John for some closing comments.","John P. Wiehoff","Okay, I've got one more page of prepared comments and then we'll address some of the questions that were submitted. So on Page 15, a look ahead. I'll try to do the best I can to share what we're seeing and what we know from a look forward around the prominent themes.","The first one is the divestiture of T-Chek and the acquisition of Phoenix. I know the last 2 quarters, there's been a lot of discussion about that and adjustments for the numbers. Given the materiality of those, we know that we're in for 2 more quarters of significant changes driven by the repositioning of the business through those transactions. So there will continue to be acquired revenues, purchase accounting, meaningful integration costs and dilution from the T-Chek earnings being sold throughout the remainder of 2013. We had the unusual costs and those transactions associated with that in the fourth quarter. So the one thing we know is that, as we plan for the third and fourth quarter, we'll continue to see effects in our results from that.","As far as the North American truckload conditions go, through July and currently, we are not seeing any meaningful change or significant adjustments to the market conditions. The North American truckload market, for us, continues to be similar. Really, if you look at our first and second quarter results, they're fairly similar and we haven't seen any meaningful drivers to significant movements in the market at this point. Really, if you look at the factors that have been driving it, I talked about the customer approach and the significant cost reductions, while there's some discussion of maybe that's starting to run its course, it's not going to go away instantly and there's plenty of momentum to continue that through the remainder of the year. On the supply side, with a slower growth environment, limited new capacity, cost pressures on carriers from new regulations and new equipment and driver pressures. None of those things are going to move real quickly and we do see continuity in the market. We don't know if there'll be a fall peak season or things will be different, but as far as what we can see now, the North American truckload conditions remain fairly balanced and competitive.","The last 2 bullet points, I'd say the most common question is that, with changes in the market over the last 3 years and, basically, us asking ourselves and other people outside, so what are you going to do about it? How are you adapting the business? That the idea of taking market share has always been a core part of our value creation and some of the questions, we'll get back to this as well too, but I guess we feel good about our formula for how we think about taking market share and pursuing profitable market share or a balanced approach. Our business model and our disciplines are that there's really 3 variables that drive the third-party transportation. It's you got to go get volume, you got to maintain your margins and you got to be productive about the labor resources and the cost that it takes to go do that, and we've got a very time-tested and refined system around how we manage our incentives and all of us are motivated to make sure that we're making a good balance of investment around that. So we will continue to aggressively go after market share. We've got very good disciplines around making sure that the freight that we bring is profitable and sustainable and continuing to look at, as the market flattens or gets more competitive, that we're making certain that we're accepting the productivity challenges and the cost reductions that it takes in order to continue to take meaningful market share and grow and expand our business.","So as I said earlier in the call, I feel good about our continued growth and market share gains in a slower, flatter environment, but we do have to continue to drive better cost control and make sure that we manufacture -- that we get to the return on investment and positive conclusions of a lot of the investments that we're making.","The last bullet point, around continuing to invest in the long-term success of the business. If you think about a lot of questions that we ask ourselves or are asked, what can you do on the short term look at earnings changes? And what can you do in the long-term? The things that make a difference and the things that we spend our money on are those competitive advantages that we talk about in our slides, in our roadshow, in our annual report. There's really 2 groups of them around people, process and technology. So we are investing in people. We're putting salespeople into the network and training them and making sure that we're being as aggressive as ever in the marketplace to go out and sell. We're training our people as much as we've ever had and we could cutback on that and we are managing headcount aggressively, but it's a variable business model. There's pressure on all of us to make sure that there's a return on the people that we add in. But we do need to stay aggressive in terms of looking at the market share gains and adding the people that it takes to go out and get them. From a process and productivity standpoint, we have short-term and long-term initiatives to look at all of our productivity gains, how we consolidate freight, the automation of the interfaces. We're doing more EDIs than ever, every day. We have more mobile apps and more connectivity to try take parts of the process out. We're standardizing our processes and doing things that we hope will have both a short and long-term impact from a process and productivity standpoint. We're automating a lot of those things. We're spending significant amounts of money on technology, not just to integrate Phoenix, but also to drive the capabilities of our management services and invest in the productivity automation of a lot of our services as well. So we look at all 3 of those things. We are managing costs and thinking about them, but we're also very sensitive to the longer-term impacts of what those investments can do for us.","The other key area of competitive advantages that we manage and invest in is our network of offices, our portfolio of services and our relationships. So the network services and account management relationships. We did open a couple of offices in Eastern Europe and we continue to think about the strength and scope of our network and building out that global platform. As I mentioned in the integration process, we're investing in the combination and optimization of a lot of our offices; strengthening, expanding our portfolio services; investing in Phoenix and strengthening global forwarding, as well as the management services. We think that's a long-term competitive advantage that will give us some more short-term lift in terms of the types of opportunities that we have to cross-sell and look for new market share. And last on the relationship side, the account management relationships and really trying to take market share from existing relationships, as well as making sure that we're pushing our value-added capabilities and expanding and cross-selling with current customers as well, too.","So that's what we're focused on. It's a combination of productivity and cost takeout and cost management along with the longer-term investments that we think will make a difference. When you put those all together, as I said earlier, we understand that the return-on-investment proof of these investments is greater EPS growth and we're committed to delivering that in the future. While we're confident about executing our strategic initiatives and continuing to take market share, when you add up the things that I just talked about, we do think it's going to be very difficult to grow our earnings in the second half of 2013.","As we look into 2014 and beyond, there's some obvious changes around the comparisons cycling off from the transactions, some of the integration costs starting to wind down. Hopefully, more aggressive realization of some of the synergies and the realization or capturing of some of the Integrated Services initiatives that we'll get after and we're prepared to continue to operate in a slower growth, more balanced market like this and have the initiatives in place to try to drive longer-term EPS growth in this environment. But also making sure that we protect and preserve the platform so that when the market changes and that growth starts to win out a little bit more in the marketplace, that we are also positioned to take advantage of that as well and have some higher growth periods like we have in the past as well.","So that's a lot of prepared comments, but it wove in some of the questions that were answered and at this point, I'll turn it over to Tim to facilitate some more of the pre-submitted questions that we can give a little bit more clarity to.","Question-and-Answer Session","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. And just before I get into the results-related questions, actually we've got a couple of questions also throughout the quarter on why the change in format? So I thought I would address that real quickly here and then get into the results-related questions.","As John had just mentioned, over last few quarters it has taken us a bit more time to explain results and go through the slides based on some of the activity, especially in the fourth quarter. And that's made it difficult to get to many of your questions. We've -- the result after the calls has been a lot of people waiting in the queue and really not having the ability to get to all the questions that people have wanted to ask. And as we reflected on that, we've talked about the best way to try to get more content and more subjects onto the call. So this is an attempt to do that and we'll evaluate the results here. As John had mentioned, he did his best to weave into some of his prepared comments and Chad's prepared comments, some of the questions that we've we received. And now we'll build on those here. But it really is an attempt to try and cover as much ground and be as productive as we can on this call and informative as we can be on this call. So I hope that clears up a little bit of the intent of doing this and, again, we will continue to evaluate how we get the most productive forum out of the 60 minutes that we spend together here.","I'd like to thank all of you that have submitted questions. We did get a lot of questions in, and we rallied to try to gather them into some themes here and we've got several that we'd like to respond to at this time. So what I'm going to do here is I'll serve the facilitation role and John, Chad and I will respond to some of the questions that have come in. So the first question, and actually several questions around productivity. In some instances I'll thematically roll these up, but on this particular one, one of the questions sized it up pretty well. So I'll refer to it specifically here. And the reference was in the first quarter call we had talked about productivity challenges and that we had initiatives underway to address the issues. And when we would start to see the results of our initiatives around productivity. And John's going to respond to that question now.","John P. Wiehoff","I think I set that one up a little bit around talking about the 3 variables that we look in our growth model, which is volume or market share gains, the margin management or preservation and then the labor part of it or the productivity side of it. I've described in previous calls how in a balanced competitive market like this, a very common tactic is rate pressure from the shippers and we continue to see that out for a number of years. And when we make that balanced approach decision towards taking market share that's profitable and how do we want to look at things, oftentimes, our network and our team is forced with making a choice around do you take flat pricing from a customer when you know that your cost of hire might be up a percent or 2. And the management decision that we've been making and we've been coaching our account managers to do is that, for the long-term and in this type of market conditions, that most often we need to accept that productivity challenge and make sure that we're improving our processes and streamlining things and eliminating our costs, just like all of our customers are being pressured to do, in order to try to preserve the long-term profitability ratios of our operating income and our growth for the business.","So while at some point, we walk away from freight everyday and we have to be smart about the balance between pricing and margins and the labor resources and the cost that we have to commit to doing it, that we are very much, like our customers, in the mode of accepting the productivity challenge and working into that equation that we're going to automate things and we're going to look at process improvement. The challenge with it, as everybody knows, is those things come in small chunks and they come continuous. It's really part of a continuous improvement theme, where every quarter we do implement new releases in the system that automate some of our processes and we have longer-term plans and roadmaps to look at consolidation and process efficiencies, so that the results show up in a longer-term, more gradual way. But it's a very important part of how we're running the company.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. And I'm going to kind of move quickly through these topics here and try to be productive with the time here. So the second theme, if you will, and there were several questions around this, really related to competition and pricing and, largely, these topics are covered in some of the prepared comments. But I'm going to take just a minute to give you a sense of how we think about competition and pricing. I don't believe this will be all that different than the way that we've talked about it in the past, but just try to build on it a little bit in the premise of the balanced marketplace and some of what has impacted our results. And speaking specifically to competition, clearly, it's a very competitive environment. We've talked a lot about that, I think, all of us in the industry are feeling this and exaggerated by the balanced marketplace and the fact that we're all competing for a pretty stagnant pool of demand. It's really hard to quantify the impact of competition. We've always felt a very competitive landscape with over 10,000 licensed freight brokerage companies and tens of thousands of asset-based carriers. It's really difficult to get your arms around the influence of competition. It's always been present. The way we measure it, there are a couple of things we measure, I'll speak specifically to the truckload marketplace, that's where most of the questions were centered, is in a couple of ways. But first is our volume growth. It's one of the reasons we highlight volume growth in our prepared comments, too, and there's a number of different resources that quantify volume growth on a month-in and month-out basis. So we pay close attention to our ability to grow our volume and our goal is to grow our volume and take share in excess of what we see happening in the industry. So that's one way that we evaluate it. And we've been pleased with our ability, over time, to grow our volumes ahead of the industry. The second measure that we look closely at is the third-party industry as a whole, and there's a lot of different ways to look at this. But again, it's something that we watch closely and, by all measures that we track, we've also been able to grow our share in the third party space. I think, third party space in total has been able to grow its share of total and we've been able to do that as well. And I won't provide specific numbers around this, but kind of slow and steady growth is what we've seen. And those are a couple of ways we look at, in an aggregated level, how we're doing in the marketplace. With all this being said, it's certainly not an attempt to dismiss the impact of competition, the viability of competition. There are larger competitors today than there have been in the past. They're focused on growing their scale and their share, and we pay close attention to the outcomes of our wins and losses and the opportunities as we compete everyday. And John spoke of our investments in delivering value in the marketplace. But we don't always win and we know that there are times when our competition is growing their business as well. So we take it seriously. We watch it closely and it's really hard to track quantifiably. But what we are focused on are those macro measures that we can track and really trying to make sure that the investments that we're making in our business, the initiatives in our business, are focused on delivering value. And by the measures that we can monitor and do monitor, we are still succeeding. And we have challenges in some of the earnings growth that we've talked a lot about on the call today and our expectation is to get to a higher rate of growth going forward and we need some cooperation in the marketplace to do that, and there's a number of factors influencing that, including our competition. And a quick correlation there too, weaved into the question around competition was also pricing and we've talked a lot about this, that there's really several factors in play. The focus of our customers on optimizing their supply chains and their transportation spend and the competition in the marketplace. And those are obviously very key in the balanced environment. Pricing has been very competitive. You see that in the results of our net revenue margin decline. And it likely will continue. John made some comments around the second half of the year and it's been the case for several quarters now and we expect there to be a pretty consistent near-term competitive marketplace and really price-focused environment going forward. So I hope that those general comments respond to that question. I'm going to move now onto one of the third questions or themes we had and it really relates to capital structure and capital allocation. I'm going to turn it over to Chad to comment on that topic.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Okay, obviously this has been a topic of discussion that I covered a little bit in my prepared remarks as well. But I think all of you who have been following us for a while know we have a very long track record returning capital to shareholders. So when you look at our capital allocation of the cash flow the business generates, first and foremost, we invest in the working capital it takes to grow the business. We're constantly looking for the right acquisitions. We have a long-standing 45% dividend payout ratio target and we view share repurchases to distribute excess cash beyond that. We view our dividend policy as more of a fixed policy and the share repurchases as a more variable way to return some capital to shareholders. As we discussed in last quarter's call and earlier today, our current intention is to return 98% to 100% of our net income to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends on an ongoing basis. We believe this payout -- total payout target is possible in most operating environments but maybe adjusted for things like acquisitions or other capital requirements, including working capital growth, which we sometimes experience when we have significant gross revenue growth. When you look historically about the amount of capital we've returned to our shareholders, for the years 2008 to 2012, we've averaged 102% of net income being returned to shareholders. As we look at the strategy, we believe it has served us well and has allowed us to continue to grow the business, both organically and through acquisition, and allowed us to be flexible in the marketplace. We have adapted our capital structure to include debt while continuing to return these high levels of capital to our shareholders. We're constantly looking at our M&A pipeline, monitoring our stock in the debt markets and assessing our capital structure in relation to those. We will take future actions as we see appropriate.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks, Chad. And I'm going to move now into a topic around kind of a capacity question and, specifically, a question around shippers' appetite for capacity risk and how shippers, their attitude towards the spot market and some comparisons to the way things were in previous quarters versus what we're seeing today in the contract versus spot market. John's going to respond to this question.","John P. Wiehoff","Yes, I would say probably one of the most prevalent themes in our customer interactions over the last couple of years is the combination of wanting to drive out any sort of expedited surge, seasonal premiums or costs as part of their cost-reduction strategies. And really trying to make sure that they secure and lock down capacity for a variety of reasons, probably some fear of limited capacity or this balanced market. But a lot of contributing things that, as I commented earlier, have really led to a reduction in spot market or transactional activity over the last couple of years. That is clearly a byproduct of the shipper attitudes and less appetite for their approach towards that. It's a good question as to whether or not that will sustain itself in the marketplace or not. That spot market or surge activity, as I commented earlier, is often driven by growth and lack of prediction around unanticipated needs. And right now, there doesn't seem to be anywhere near that level of it as we would see normally prior to the recession, 3 or 4 years ago. So I do think that's one of the most meaningful secular shifts, just driven by how customers are managing their supply chain and what their procurement attitude is towards transportation.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. Our next topic is going to be around operating expenses. And several questions around operating expenses and, specifically, why personnel expenses and SG&A expenses, outside of the unusual item in this quarter, why they grew faster than net revenue and Chad's going to respond to that question.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Okay. John covered the personnel, I think, pretty well in his opening remarks. We've continued to invest into the future of the business, the branches have continued to add people to help them with future growth. Although part of that increase in the heads was offset by some reductions and some of the incentive programs. When you look at other SG&A expenses, there's -- for the quarter over last year's quarter, there's 2 real drivers of it. One, we've talked about already, which is the law suit. And if you look at our provision for doubtful accounts, was the other significant variance compared to last year. In the second quarter of 2012, we recovered some receivables that had previously been written off and actually had a negative expense or a credit in our provision for doubtful accounts of about $1 million. This year, we had what is more normal, maybe slightly on the high end of our provision for doubtful accounts, of $3 million. So when you look at just the swing in the provision for doubtful accounts, that's about $4 million. And you take the $5 million and the $4 million, it's pretty much the whole increase of year-over-year growth in the quarterly operating expenses. There are some other increases and decreases mixed in there. The other, probably, area of biggest increase, but to a less magnitude is travel. Some of that travel has to do with the Phoenix integration and some of it has to do with the global manager meeting that was held in April of this year to introduce the Phoenix managers to everybody else and to cover some key initiatives with our leadership team.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks, Chad. We're kind of winding down here with a few minutes left. We're going to try to get a couple more in here. I'm going to quickly respond to questions around hours of service. This is obviously more of a Q3 topic with the fact that the regulation went into effect on July 1, and really don't have all that much different to say than a lot that's been said in the industry. We did a lot of work and planning around this topic with our customers, especially as it related to long-haul freight that was most affected by the new rules. And a bit too early to tell in terms of the impact, but when we have talked about this in the past in the various forums that we've been in, we don't expect it to help at all in terms of the results. It's another challenge for carriers in terms of their productivity and availability and already a difficult climate for them. So we expect to add -- after the third quarter, we'll be better able to quantify this as more time plays out in our truckload business, and in looking at some of the measures that we look at pretty typically. But in general, difficult for us to comment, specifically, at this time. We don't believe it'll be a helpful factor in the challenges that we face today, but that being said, really too hard to tell right now or quantify specifically the impact. So I'm going to move on to kind of a couple of questions that I'm going to combine into one and ask John to close our responses here with this topic and I'll do my best to paraphrase it here. And they really talk about our growth and whether our growth, our earnings growth trails or meets our expectation. And then also, comment about with the slower growth in the U.S. economy, maybe more in the lower single-digit area. And I'll read here verbatim a little bit: can our business model achieve double-digit growth in earnings sustainably? So I'll turn it over to John to talk a little bit about our earnings results here and our view of growth going forward with the current economic environment.","John P. Wiehoff","So when we look at our earnings growth and our performance and try to address this topic as best I can. For the first question, we are disappointed this year in the earnings growth. Some of the things we anticipated, the headwinds of T-Chek and some of integration spending. I would say that integration spending has been as meaningful as we expected, maybe a little bit more. Margins are difficult to predict, but we really haven't seen any relief there. And we've had some unusual expenses in the first 2 quarters that we've highlighted and talked through that Chad just discussed in others. Did we expect, at the beginning of the year, that 2013 would be a great year or the high-end of our performance? No. Has it been a little bit disappointing than what we thought at the beginning of the year largely around expenses? Yes, it has been. When you step back and look at it, longer-term, around our growth rates and our long-term expectations, the primary way that we think about it, if you look at that sort of ground level of GDP growth or inflation or some sort of economic growth in the 3% to 4% range historically, maybe being less than that the last couple of years or going forward. That would be the foundation of growth and pricing and margins that we would go after. Longer-term, we still believe that our volume and our net revenue is what will drive similar to our earnings growth, that those, over time, while they're going to fluctuate, should stay together. If you look at a foundation of GDP growth, we, as Tim highlighted earlier, we feel pretty good about our ability to take market share and our ability to continue to do that in the future. In a slower growth environment with more competition, as we've talked in previous calls, it's more difficult to take market share, but we feel like we can continue to do that. So in a slower growth environment of a couple of percent, continuing to take market share at a single-digit rate gets us up into the mid-to-high single digits. Over the last 2 or 3 decades, we've had periods of time where we've been able to have sustained margin expansion. We've just gone through a period of time where we've had sustained margin contraction. We believe over time that will fluctuate but level itself off. Additional growth areas for us in the past have been productivity gains and leveraging our cost structure. We're going to continue to strive for those, as I talked earlier, to try to increase our earnings. We've also been able to acquire businesses or acquire shares to increase our earnings growth as well too. So when we put that all together, there is a lot of opportunity left. There's a lot of momentum to the third-party industry and how third parties are looked at and what growth there is in the supply chain. Our margins are going to fluctuate, our costs are going to fluctuate, our investments are going to fluctuate. But when we look at the industry landscape and our opportunity and how we can execute over a longer period of time, we do think that a double-digit target is still reasonable for us even in a slower growth environment.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. And I think that will close out the hour here and we did our best to cover as many of the questions that were submitted as possible. I know there were a lot that we were unable to get to. And if you would like to schedule some time with us, as is always the case, feel free to reach out to me. My email is on the website and we'll try to coordinate some time to follow-up on some of your questions.","I'd also like to remind you that there's a replay of the call available on our website, and that replay will be available shortly. It's available by dialing (800) 406-7325 and entering the pass code 4630440. And that'll be available, I guess, about 7:00 Eastern. So just in -- well, actually I should probably change that.

(NASDAQ:CHRW) Q2 2015 Earnings Call July 29, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson Second Quarter 2015 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, Tim Gagnon will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, July 29, 2015.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, the Director of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead sir.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On our call this morning will be John Wiehoff, Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Clarke, our new Chief Financial Officer. Andy joined us in June and has extensive experience in our industry. Prior to joining Robinson, he served as the President and CEO of Panther Expedited Services and the CFO of Forward Air after rolled in investment banking and corporate finance.","John and Andy will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our second quarter and we will follow that with a response to the pre-submitted questions we received after earnings release yesterday.","Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate the discussion. These slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Andy will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments.","I'd like to remind you that comments made by John, Andy or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","With that, I'll turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments on slide three with a review of our second quarter results.","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Tim, and good morning everyone. I'll start by highlight some of our key long-term financial metrics that we focus in on every quarter. So on that slide three, our total revenues of $3.5 billion for the quarter represent a 1.2% increase over the previous year. Net revenues of $584 million represent a 12.1% increase over last year's second quarter.","Our operating income or income from operations increased 14.3% for the quarter, one of the things that we often reference is our growth in income from operations relative to our net revenues and our hopes to mirror that over time or exceed it if possible. And so we like the fact that our income from operations grew in excess of the net revenue growth rate.","Earnings per share of $0.94 compared to $0.80 last year represents a 17.5% increase. We're proud of the results. We think it's a good quarter. If you look at a couple of the other metrics that we share there, our average head count is up 10%. That's including Freightquote; if you eliminate the impact of Freightquote it's about a 1.5% increase for the quarter, but we like our performance for the quarter.","We're investing in our business and obviously as we'll get into, there were some things in the marketplace and some marketplace trends that went in our favor throughout the quarter. And we talked often in the past about those market cycles and how a lot of the value that we try to add is to protect our customers from exposure, either pricewise or service-wise do those market cycles.","So sometimes they go against us and sometimes they go in our favor and we're acknowledging that this quarter some market conditions went in our favor, particularly in the truckload sector. But in addition I hope from an overall perspective one of the other things that you take away from the call is the fact that we are making a lot of longer term investments that we feel positive about. Some of the headline items have been the larger acquisitions with Phoenix and Freightquote that we feel very positive about. We've been making investments in our sales force and going after both market share volume, but also trying to have balanced growth around how we grow our profitability and our margins as well, so organic and inorganic growth.","I mentioned that we're investing in our team. It's important in our definition of balanced growth that we invest in both the human capital to grow our business, but also the technology and the productivity gains to make them more efficient and to add value to our customers in better and better ways.","So, that's been our formula for sustainable growth that when the market moves in our direction we'll take advantage of it and when it goes against us we'll do the best that we can. And over time we think our average results are going to be very good and create a lot of shareholder value and that's what I think you saw in this quarter.","So, moving off those overall enterprise results to slide four, talking about transportation that makes up the majority of the business on slide four. Always like to remind everybody that there are a lot of factors that impact our transportation net revenue margin percentage but, nonetheless, I think it is helpful to start by looking at it on an overall basis, because there is a lot of relationship between the various modes of transportation and integrated services and how we interact with the marketplace. From a total transportation standpoint, total revenues were up 2.9% to $3.1 billion, net revenues of $548 million or a 12.8% increase in transportation.","The chart on slide four that shows our overall net revenue margin percentage shows 17.5% for the quarter, compared to 16% a year ago or 150 basis point improvement. Throughout the individual transportation services and upcoming slides, we will highlight a number of the items that are impacting that from a C.H. Robinson perspective and summarize the various factors that are impacting it. The most material in the quarter would be fuel.","We've given examples and talked in the past about fuel behaving as a surcharge pass-through in the majority of our business, particularly on the truckload side. If you do the math of reducing the price of fuel on both what we charge our customers and pay our carriers and reducing both amounts by an equal amount, it creates margin percentage expansion and with the meaningful reduction in fuel year-over-year that is the most material impact driving that net revenue margin percentage change in the second quarter.","The second most material item in that would be the mix. If you factor in, this does include the results of Freightquote and higher growth in LTL, higher growth in ocean services and higher growth in shorter length of haul truckload services, all which have a higher net revenue margin percentage on a comparable basis. So, mix issues are number two on the materiality scale of that margin comparison.","And the third factor that again I'll get into by each individual item does relate to pricing and the fact that, particularly in our contractual or committed pricing arrangements, there can be timing differences in terms of how we adjust to the market and when prices move. And as you'll see on some of the services, the pricing to the customers increased at a slightly greater percentage than what our cost of hire was during the quarter. But that would be the third most material thing in terms of explaining that variance.","So those are comments that we'll share on an overall basis about our transportation. And then moving from that to slide five and our truckload results, which represent over half of our revenues. For the quarter, you see that truckload net revenues grew at 8.6%. It was indicated on the first slide a quarter ago I guess when we were talking about our first quarter results, we did indicate that April started slower than our first quarter had been trending. And as you see in our second quarter results here, throughout the quarter, the months of May and June improved during it to finish at 8.6% net revenue growth for the quarter. Freightquote did add about 3.5% net revenue growth to the truckload category. So some of that was from the acquisition, but also the larger growth came from the improvement in the net revenue margin and the trends throughout the quarter.","Andy will touch a little bit more and give you some quantification of that, but as I mentioned in my opening comments, we did see market conditions improvement throughout the quarter. Our North American truckload volume grew 7%. So in the upper right-hand corner of slide five, we give some of the key metrics that support that truckload activity, with volume being a key one. Similar to the first quarter, volume ended up 7%, with about 3% of that being acquired volume from Freightquote and 4% being our legacy organic growth from our network.","We do see a lot of activity in the marketplace with regards to bid activity, and we do believe that our volume growth increases this year have come from success in those bid opportunities and doing a good job of responding to the requests of our more committed or contractual customers. We did see less spot market activity in the second quarter of this year compared to a year ago. It becomes very difficult, as we've talked in the past, there is no real clean definition of committed or contractual freight versus spot market freight. In our book of business, there's a continuum of pricing commitments and relationships on the extremes. There's very transactional activity where you price it (10:00) and there's no commitment either way; and similarly on large bids there can be very high expectations of committed performance. But there are a lot of different variations in the middle.","Overall, though, it's pretty clear that compared to a year-ago where market conditions were much more volatile and route guide compliance was a lot lower a year ago, that in this year's second quarter, there was less spot market activity and more freight that was tendered and executed in accordance with contracts and committed pricing.","Another important metric when you look up in that upper right-hand corner, again it's difficult because our network is so diverse and we have pricing that is very diverse across tens of thousands of lanes. What we try to do to share those pricing dynamics is do the best we can to scrub out fuel surcharges and get down to consistent pricing comparisons to the best we can. Those estimates are in the upper right-hand corner.","I mentioned earlier in talking about total transportation that we did have some pricing improvement throughout the quarter. Our best estimates of that above are that our average pricing to shippers increased 3% year-over-year and our average cost of hire went up 2.5%.","Couple of additional comments that we can share with you about that, again that pricing represents a blend of all of those different types of customer relationships that I described earlier. In the contractual or committed category of pricing in this quarter, in many cases the increases were slightly higher than that. I think we would estimate 3% to 5% as being a market range of the types of price increases. And because of the spot market changes that I described earlier, in many cases certain prices were lower than a year-ago based on year-over-year comparisons of market conditions.","Another comment that I would share with you, because I know that it's important to all of us to understand the trends and what's sustainable, is that one of the things we often talk about and feel that we have unique exposure to in the marketplace is the variables created by produce season. Because of our market leading presence there, and when products starts to ship and when those produce commodities come to market, can have a meaningful impact on when and how the cost of capacity starts to change.","Typically, we see a cost of increase throughout the second quarter where the normal trend would be that the cost of hire would increase throughout the quarter. And one of the observations that we would make is we did see a slower rate of increase throughout the quarter than we typically would have.","In some cases that could be attributed to a later start of the produce shipping in the produce season. It could be related to softer economic demand overall, just creating a softer market. And those are the sorts of things that become important to us in adapting to the market every day and every week and making sure that we're servicing our customers and fulfilling the commitments that we have. But nonetheless, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our customer shipper pricing did exceed the average cost of hire for the quarter and that was positive for our net revenue margin expansion.","One other comment on this page that is important for those of you who follow our business is the last bullet point that we did add over 3,000 new carriers in the second quarter of 2015. That is a record high for us. An important part of our value add on the truckload services is the fact that it's a very fragmented market and that we can work with our shippers to get the most efficient and effective access to the right carrier for the right shipment at the right time.","As we've talked in the past, we have more than 50,000 carriers under contract and we are constantly adding to that. There is a lot of churn. So in the short-term we don't know exactly what type of relationship and the amount of freight that will be moved by those 3,000 carriers. But it is an important Vitality Index to know that there is capacity coming into the marketplace and that we are growing our access and relationships to those at a record pace.","Moving then to slide six in our LTL results. You see our net revenues in LTL increased 35.8% for the quarter. That does include the significant LTL net revenue that was acquired in the Freightquote acquisition. Overall the net revenue margin for the LTL services did increase in the second quarter. That also was impacted by the mix issues that I talked about. Andy will share some comments about the Freightquote business and the higher nature margin of that transactional business in LTL.","Our volumes, as you can see, were up 33% with approximately 20% of that growth coming from Freightquote. We did have good volume growth in our legacy LTL business. We've talked in the past about our market leading capabilities and the capabilities that we have around executing with larger more dedicated customers. We feel very good about our market presence and the share that we are gaining in that.","During the second quarter, it did not translate into similar net revenue growth in the legacy business. That's a combination of reasons. I think fuel has an impact in the LTL area. That's a little bit different than in our truckload space, as well as just some price compression in the more higher volume dedicated business that we bid on. But nonetheless, we think this is an area that's similar to truckload where we have a market leading presence and we feel good about our capabilities.","Moving to slide seven in our intermodal results. Intermodal net revenue increased 6.2% in the quarter. And as you can see in the comments, similar to the first quarter, the majority of that growth came from the acquisition of Freightquote. As we've said in the past, we're proud of our capabilities and our service in this area. We know that we add a lot of value to the customers that we work with in the intermodal space, but we do not have a market-leading presence. Scale is very important and we have found it tougher to grow this service line. But, nonetheless, we remain committed to it and we'll continue to invest and grow that service for our customers.","Moving to slide eight in our global forwarding services of air, ocean, and customs, fairly similar messages to past quarters around this. We had overall net revenue growth of 8.6% for the quarter on global forwarding, led by the ocean revenue of 17%, air net revenues decreasing 9.9% and customs net revenues increasing 6.4%.","Same story here that we've invested significantly the last three years in strengthening our network and our operational capabilities in our global forwarding business and we feel very good about our current capabilities and where we're at. Our core strength is in the Transpacific corridor and specifically being number one in the NVOCC rankings between China and North America. So we're trying to build market share and leverage that core strength of ocean services and also investing in our air and services and other corridors around the world.","Our airfreight net revenues for the quarter is being down, we did have some pricing changes in the marketplace and some variances in volumes with larger customers that drove that. Growth in airfreight is an important key initiative for us and our total customer account did grow and we feel like we are expanding our presence in the airfreight, but given the relevance of size and density to your margins and net revenue and the fluctuations in the marketplace, we do expect to see the net revenue on the airfreight line item to fluctuate a little bit more aggressively.","Moving then to slide nine in our other logistics services, again the largest item in this category is our transportation management services. Net revenues increased 22.6% for the quarter. As we've talked in the past, this is a very important growth area for us. One, because it reflects the current marketplace and where the opportunity is to engage with a lot of our customers. It represents the scale capabilities that we have to really work with larger customers on a more integrated way.","And as I, again have commented often in the past there's a little bit different business model in a lot of our transportation management services where it is much more common to have a five-year contract or a three to five-year contract. We do spend or invest a fair amount of implementation dollars in those newer relationships, so we continue to grow with new customers and we're investing significantly in the implementation costs to grow that business and we feel very positive about the long-term value creation that could come from that.","The last service line on slide 10, our sourcing results resorts or Robinson Fresh as we're branded in the marketplace. You see a net revenue increase of 2.2% for the second quarter and that was driven by some of the growth in our strategic commodities. Again for those of you to remind you or to inform those who are not familiar, the strategic commodities produce and produce sourcing for us works very similar to some of the transportation markets, where we can add more value in the commodities that are fragmented or nomadic and follow the sun around the planet and we did see growth in those categories.","The total revenue is declining by 10%. That is representative of the fact that this is the sourcing revenues where we take title to the product. And really across the industry there were some meaningful price declines in a number of the categories that we do business in. So that is reflective, really, of just the reduced price activity in the marketplace where a year ago I think there were some freezes and some weather conditions that drove prices up and this year we saw declines in general across most of the categories that we deal with. That net revenue margin improvement represents a return to something that we feel is in the normal range of where we can conduct our sourcing activities going forward.","So that concludes my comments by service area. With that, I will turn it over to Andy Clarke. As Tim mentioned, he is making his C.H. Robinson Public Forum debut with us. I know that a number of you know Andy from the industry in the past as do I and a number of the rest of us here at Robinson. He has been with us for 60 days and we're very proud to have him be a part of the team at Robinson.","So with that, I will turn it over to him.","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","That you, John. I appreciate the kind words. Robinson is a great company and I'm really excited to be on the team. For nearly 20 years I've had the good fortune to interact with a number of Robinson people and I've always been impressed. Now being on the inside, I can tell you that the reputation, the accolades and the awards like the Inbound Logistics #1 3PL for the fifth year in a row are well-deserved.","And now to the numbers, I'm starting on slide 11 with our summarized income statement. As John mentioned earlier, our net revenue accelerated during the quarter. Net revenue per day for April, ended up 7.5% as we saw performance improving, going into the last week of the month. That trend continued in May and June as net revenue per day increased 15% and 14%, respectively. Month-to-date in July, our total company net revenue per day is up just over 12% from the same period last year.","I'd like to now spend a little time on our operating ratios and some of the expense categories contributing to the excellent bottom line results our people deliver. We improved operating income as a percent of net revenue by 70 basis points during the quarter to 39.2%. We focused quite a bit on this metric and these results represent our best performance in the past 10 quarters.","Personnel expenses, our largest expense item were up 10.5% in the quarter. Almost the entire amount of the dollar increase is attributable to the additional head count related to Freightquote. Both historical Robinson as well as Freightquote operated more efficiently this quarter than in the same quarter last year. A majority of the rest of the increase in expenses is related to our variable incentive plans. Congratulations to the Robinson team for its ability to serve our customers, grow the business and manage expenses.","Other SG&A expenses increased 11.3%. Again, the Freightquote acquisition, including amortization expense of $1.9 million was the primary driver of the increase. As John mentioned, we are very pleased with the acquisition of Freightquote and the integration is proceeding very well. Our philosophy has been and will continue to be to acquire high quality companies and successfully integrate them.","Total operating expenses increased 10.7% in the quarter, which is well below our net revenue growth. As a percent of net revenue, total operating expenses decreased to 60.8% in this year's second quarter from 61.5% in the second quarter of last year.","Moving on to slide 12, another financial information. We had a very strong cash flow quarter generating just over $150 million in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $12.9 million through the second quarter. As we discussed during our first quarter call, we expect full-year 2015 capital expenditures to be between $40 million and $50 million. The additional expenses in the back half of the year relate to the building of a second data center.","We finished the quarter with total debt of $1.13 billion. The balance on our revolver is $630 million with a 1.3% rate and our long-term debt remains unchanged at $500 million with an average coupon of 4.28%.","And finally, before turning it back to John, I'd like to cover our capital distribution to shareholders on slide 13. During the quarter, we returned approximately $106 million to shareholders and that broke out with just over $57 million in dividend and $49 million in ongoing share repurchases. In the last five-and-a-half years, we have returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the most recent quarter, we returned approximately 78% of net income to shareholders. Our target continues to be to return approximately 90% of net revenue to shareholders annually.","Thank you very much for your time today. We appreciate your interest in our company. I will now turn it back to John for his closing comments.","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Andy. Just a few high-level statements addressing slide 14 and a look ahead before we transfer into the Q&A. Just reiterating what Andy stated earlier that our enterprise net revenue per day is up 12% in July. That's one data point that we share with you. As a reminder, I think this quarter is a good example of how market conditions can move quickly and things can change fairly fast, which makes it difficult to forecast or give longer term guidance in our business. But the improvement that we saw in May and June has carried on to a large extent in early July.","Freightquote, talked about it a number of times. I think the summary comment there half a year into it is that we believe we bought a great business. Tim Barton and the team down there were doing a lot of very positive things that we've put together a very thoughtful integration plan that we're well into and the results are working. The Freightquote integration has a lot to do with our segmentation strategies.","The business that Freightquote has a lot of success with is predominantly small customer LTL activity. And as we've looked at how we want to continue to compete in the marketplace that's a segment that we're very interested in, but have not always invested in our network with the same commitment of resources that we have to the larger more strategic customers.","So, Freightquote is a great business. It's helped reinvigorate one of the segments that we do have capabilities in, and I think that's at the core of why the acquisition will work and continue to provide lots of career growth and opportunity for their employees as well as create some shareholder value for the C.H. Robinson network.","The last comment, we used the term balanced growth, and I started to touch on this and commenting about why we felt positive about our results for the quarter. But I just want to touch on it a little bit more because I do think it is how we try to differentiate ourselves and create the right culture for our employees and the right atmosphere to service our customers in a way that we think is unique and it really does focus on sustainable, long-term balanced growth.","We talk a lot about pursuing market share gains and that's, obviously, a very important metric for us in the long run. That's how we create value and that's how we grow the network. But we don't just pursue market share at the expense of the other metrics that matter to us as well around margin improvement and customer service and some of the other things that we balance with that to try to create the right mix of those metrics to create stakeholder value for everybody involved and provide the right career paths for our employees.","As we talked about in people metrics, we are adding to the network after some volatile years of market swings up and down, we do feel like we're in a little bit more consistent environment and we're confident that it's the right thing to do to be investing in our team and growing our network, so we expect to continue to do that.","Throughout the remainder the year, I feel very good about the technology investment. Chad has transitioned fully into that role and we're spending more money than ever to make sure that we're properly positioned to be competitive in our technology platform of Navisphere and making certain that we're balancing productivity gains with all of the human capital talent that we're putting into the network.","And maybe most importantly, we do continue to feel very proud about the culture that we have at Robinson and the long-term focus that enables us to do the right thing for our customers regardless of those market conditions, as I mentioned earlier, and that's what we'll continue to pursue.","On the challenges side, the thing that I think is worth sharing, because when we've talked about our long-term double-digit EPS growth goal, over the last five or six quarters, we've been able to exceed that. But one of the things that we've shared pretty consistently over the last three or four years is that when we do meet with our larger customers, there does continue to be a fair amount of what I would label as broader economic uncertainty that correlates to overall freight activity in those large customers.","A number of the large retailers, manufacturers and food and beverage customers that we've dealt with for a long period of time continue in this time period of the last three or four years to be much more focused on supply chain efficiency and cost takeout as opposed to the tailwind of market share growth and volume gains that were prevalent for a long period of time before that.","So when you ask us sort of what on the negative side or on the challenge side, what do we continue to think about, it does feel like some of the tailwind in our industry that was there for a long time of underlying organic freight growth is maybe a little bit more challenged in some of those bigger customers over the more recent period than it has been in the past.","And then secondly, I know we always get a lot of questions and talk about the fact that technology is changing very quickly and our industry is changing very quickly. And while we feel very good about where we're at today with Navisphere from a competitive standpoint, we do have to constantly stay alert to how quickly things are changing and any technological disruption that is out there. We factor all those variables into that balanced growth concept and feel like we're doing the right thing to mix them together and add value.","So with that, that ends our prepared comments on the quarter as well as high-level thoughts to look ahead. And with that, I will turn it back to Tim to facilitate some of the Q&A that was submitted.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. And as always thank you to the analysts and investors that take the time to submit questions. After we released on Tuesday, we've got a lot of great questions. We'll do our best to get to all of them. And I welcome calls to try to get to the questions that we don't have time to answer. Calls or email, please follow-up with me I'm happy to schedule time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","So we'll get right into it here. And the first question is for John. And that is around productivity. Could you talk about sales force productivity trends and your outlook on your ability to drive North America truckload and LTL volume on an organic basis as well as what opportunities you see with Freightquote?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, drilling into those productivity gains that I referenced a couple of times, one of the common themes across our network is that we have evolved a lot of our roles and job families to conform more to how the marketplace and our business is changing. I referenced the segmentation initiatives on the customer side of the business. And as we've grown to be a larger global enterprise, one of the things we've become more sensitive to is making certain that we have the right specialization of sales and sales people with the right competency matching up with the customers with the right capabilities and where they want to buy in the marketplace.","So, when we look at productivity, it's different today than it's been in the past around the various segments and the various activities that we have. More and more the operational activity is being isolated and automated for efficiency. On a high-level basis, we feel very good, as I mentioned in the opening comments, that our volume growth really in most every service this quarter exceeded our head count growth in terms of the talent that we're adding. And that is our long-term objective is to continue to provide the right types of career paths, the right types of training and really focus those people exactly where they can be most effective in the marketplace; and we do think that's translating into salespeople and operational productivities that are helping us create value.","Now, those gains come with a lot of investment and a lot of effort, and at the same time making certain that we have the right people and the right team put together and the right culture is probably the most important thing that's driving the success of our business. So that balanced growth initiative is all about balancing the two of those.","Tying in the Freightquote question, one of the things we're much more aware of and focused on today is the uniqueness that's required to serve those very small transactional customers that might literally only ship with you once a quarter or a couple of times per year, and how do you create the right information management and customer service for an experience like that relative to somebody who you might be doing hundreds of shipments per day with. So, we do have an evolving set of metrics and different capabilities, and again the branding and focus that Freightquote investment has brought to our network we think will also be an enhancement to our productivity.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. Operating margin was much better than we expected. Is that a factor of Phoenix and Freightquote operating margins sustainably better than originally targeted, as well as improving on last quarter?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. It was very strong quarter for our operating margin in most of our key metrics. We had really good results in all of our business units, including Phoenix and Freightquote. It has been and will continue to be our goal to grow operating expenses less than net revenues and we were able to accomplish that in the second quarter. John talked just before about balanced growth, and I think this shows we can do it. We're focused on growing our market share profitably with an ongoing commitment to optimization and efficiency.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Can you discuss what the company saw in terms of spot freight availability? Do you agree that there is less spot freight available due to shippers moving more freight under contractual arrangements, as a result of concern about capacity availability? If yes, what percentage of lower spot freight was the result of economic conditions and what percent was the result of shipper actions?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We do see a trend in marketplace in our business reviews. I think it's been fairly well-established and we would agree with the notion that transportation, particularly full truckload transportation is ripe for higher than inflation price increases in the future due to driver shortages and the increasing cost of equipment and emissions control and all the rest of those things.","So it is a pervasive practice and something that we agree with that more and more of the larger customers are trying to contract out or get committed pricing on more of their freight to make certain that they can protect themselves and plan their own supply chain against a marketplace that has more and more uncertainty. So that is definitely something that we see.","I do believe that our engagement in those contractual relationships was a positive for us in the quarter that when, as I described earlier, the market settles down from a spot market activity that those commitments and that dedicated volume, particularly with more available capacity in the marketplace was a very positive thing for us in the quarter.","The question asks around the quantification of it. And as we said in the past, we wish we could. That's a very difficult thing, because of the wide variety of types of commitments and the continuum of relationships that we have, but we do believe that more than half of our truckload shipments that we moved in the quarter were on committed or contracted pricing and that's very different than 20 years ago, exactly how it moves from week to week and this quarter over last quarter, it's difficult to be more precise about that. But definitely a trend in the marketplace that's relevant and had an impact on our results for the quarter.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Okay, thanks, John. And the next question again for you, with the looser spot market capacity seems to played a positive role in the acceleration of organic net revenue growth in May and June, as you were able to arbitrage this against your committed rate. This has continued into July. But is there any concern that shippers will start to push back against your committed rates given the current market dynamics. Essentially I'm asking, is this type of net revenue margin benefit sustainable?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, one of the realities of the marketplace that feeds into the previous comment that I made is that while there is a lot of bids and a lot of contractual commitments that get fulfilled in the marketplace, the reality of it is that the market is much more fluid than the paper might always indicate. And when market conditions move aggressively, sometimes it will provoke earlier rebidding of activity than might have otherwise been anticipated.","Obviously, when the market prices change aggressively, like they did a year ago, you see a lot of people in the marketplace going after more lucrative opportunities or changing things. So, there's this template of relationships and expectations and contracts. We've always been very proud and believe that we fulfill our commitments as well as anybody in the marketplace, hopefully better and that we understand those. But whenever the marketplace moves, there's always the potential for reaction, either on the provider side or the shipper side, and that is exactly what we do every day and our account managers to continue to add value.","So I wouldn't say there's concern because that's what we've been doing for 110 years, but the reality of it is even though the market is becoming more and more committed, you always have to be prepared for how the market is going to continue to evolve and how anybody may react to that and how we may need to adjust.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. What is your outlook for capacity availability especially as the new ELD rule and other regulatory requirements are rolled out between now and the end of the year? Do you believe the ELD requirement will result in an immediate tightening of capacity, or do you believe it will take time to see any impact?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Our outlook for capacity overall remains positive. Congratulations to our team. They signed up, as John mentioned, 3,000 brand new carriers in the quarter. What's interesting is that those carriers on average ran eight loads each for us. So not only did we sign them up, but we immediately put them to work.","With respect to ELDs, the final rules are scheduled to come out later this year and based on our time spent with the regulators, the implementation will extend over the next couple of years. The impact on capacity just like in any of the other regulatory chains will be felt over time. Again very similar with other regulatory changes, we would expect that certain industry groups will contest the current state of the rule and where things ultimately end up, quite frankly, will be different than where they are now, but it'll also be different than many of us can quite frankly predict.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Okay. Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Please discuss any updated thoughts with respect to M&A. Are there any verticals, geographies that are more attractive for CHRW? What is management's current view with respect to consolidation in the brokerage space and longer term implications for growth and returns?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No change on the overall strategy. And just to repeat it quickly is that, we are primarily focused on high quality M&A opportunities with more focus on the service offerings or regions where we lack the scale and the market leadership that we have in many of our services.","So, things like intermodal, things like managed services, I referenced airfreight and other regions of the world in terms of global forwarding where we believe we could have a disproportionately positive impact to our network by adding scale and adding high-quality businesses to that. So, we are looking. We are focused on that with a very similar philosophy to what we've had in the past.","Our view with regards to consolidation, I think the relevant point about all that is maybe what I talked earlier from a segmentation standpoint. Your size and scale in the marketplace does impact the sorts of things that you can hopefully be more effective at doing. There are tens of thousands of brokers in the United States and that or more in Europe and other parts of the world and that broad brokerage network can compete transactionally in a lot of the local markets and we see that every day. I think we've talked in the past about one of the bigger competitive landscape changes that we've seen over the last five or six years is more people aggressively going after scale. Maybe scale in one service line or scale in their global footprint, so that they can combine services and aspire to provide more integrated things.","So, the consolidation, if you will, in our industry is relevant from the standpoint of it changes who you might see in certain bids and what their capabilities would be, but the balance of all of that as we have continued to talk about too, is that part of the reason why people are investing and trying to gain scale is because we do believe that the longer term trends are favorable, that more of the marketplace is going through a 3PL or the type of provider. So from the terms of ultimate competitiveness and pricing and margins, it's a balance of broader industry growth and opportunity with how the globe is changing with the level of investment and the capability and competitiveness of the companies that are coming in and investing in that.","So certainly a relevant topic that we're paying attention to. And I mentioned it a couple of times, but we have in the last three years completed the two largest acquisitions in our 110-year history. So while we are being more focused and looking for high-quality companies, we are participating to a slight degree in terms of being able to align ourselves with some high-quality companies that we've known for a long time and feel are having a good impact on our network.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy and it relates to the Freightquote deal. When you announced the Freightquote deal, the company mentioned a $7 million per year increase in interest expense associated with the transaction. Interest and other was down a little bit in the quarter, however, are there one-time items that impacted that line or is the financing cost just coming in lower-than-expected?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. No, during the quarter we had a one-time credit of just under $1 million that impacted that number. However, going forward our interest expense will be approximately $7 million per quarter.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Okay. Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Can you clarify what was behind the 10% decline in sourcing gross revenue, particularly given that the case volume was up?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think I drifted into answering this question in the prepared comments which is the fact that we do source and distribute, take title to a variety of commodities in that perishable area. And a number of the items that we deal with do have ultimate market prices that fluctuate rather meaningfully based on market conditions and crop output. And really the gross revenues in that service line being down are just a reflection of across many categories just across-the-board reduction in the price of those commodities compared to a year ago.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. It sounds like Freightquote.com has better net revenue margins than your traditional LTL business. Can you remind us why this dynamic exists?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Following up on John's earlier comments, it's the difference in customer mix between Freightquote and traditional C.H. Robinson LTL business. Freightquote has a high concentration of small transactional customers, which is quite frankly it's great for us, because it's an area we're focusing on. Typically this is a higher margin business, whereas the traditional Robinson customer profile tends to be larger high volume shippers with outsource agreements while it's higher volume, it's lower margin, we can execute it very efficiently.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. The next question again for you, what was the driver of the business trend acceleration in May, June, and July? It seems like the rest of the freight market has seen sluggishness?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. The faster growth in these three months is primarily the result of increased truckload net revenue per shipment. Usually at this time in the peak season, we have a bit more pressure with our purchase transportation costs, but right now, there's enough available capacity that we are able to manage our costs effectively. We would agree that with the comment that the market seems to be a bit sluggish, but again, we've been able to hold our volume growth pretty steady thus far in July.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Please discuss your thoughts around the source of the 7% North America truckload volume growth during the quarter, specifically the 4% excluding Freightquote. I am assuming it's a combination of many factors, but are you seeing more contractual commitments driving this growth or is it from employee efficiencies as your recent head count additions become more productive or something else?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think this question ties back to a number of the earlier comments that I've made really under the umbrella of our balanced growth culture and mentality that we are very focused on longer-term goals of gaining market share, but are also balanced on not trying to do that at the expense of making commitments that aren't sustainable or below market pricing that we know we're going to have to adjust at a different time. So, we have the sales force that we're investing in, dedicated account managers that we're investing in. And we are responding to the changes in the marketplaces that I discussed earlier around a greater prevalence of desire for commitments and pricing and committed freight. So we're pursuing all of that and what we think is a balanced way, and it did lead to good volume growth in the quarter.","Similarly, the second part of the question around employee efficiency and head count, you do need to add to your team in order to successfully grow this business. I think everybody in our industry has eventually acknowledged that that there still is a lot about the relationships and the talent and the human element that grows our business, but there's also no doubt that the technology is changing and the productivity opportunities are training and you have to do both.","So, the statement in the question around it's a combination of many factors is dead on. And I think we've hit on most of them today in terms of describing how we're approaching the marketplace and what we believe drove the success in the quarter.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next one again for you. Investors have seemingly become tepid on transportation names, believing that the manufacturing softness may play into the retail side. While we know it is difficult to predict the future, what is your current outlook heading into the second half of the year and your general discussions with your large customers?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I touched on this a little bit earlier in the challenges side of the outlook. I would probably temper those comments less specifically to the second half of 2015 and maybe more just towards our long-term investor guidance and why we're talking about our business a little bit differently today than maybe five years ago, is that it does feel like, particularly with our larger customers, that economic conditions here in North America, just they're not as focused on growth gains and market share as they were maybe 10 years ago and more focused on supply chain efficiency and savings, which is why we see opportunity and growth in our managed services, which is why our technology spending and account management spending and investment is as high as it's ever been because we're responding to those opportunities in the marketplace and continue to feel really good about what those will provide for us.","The situation in Asia continues to be something that we monitor as well, too, around the health of those economies and the production activity and how our growth will occur. And again, for a number of years, with that core lane that we're involved in from China to North America, the double-digit growth was almost assured. And while we still see a lot of future opportunity in that, it's maybe a little bit less and a little bit uncertain exactly what it's going to be based on how things are moving.","I do think that's one of the relevant backdrops that has impacted our thought process of where we're investing and how we're going to the marketplace and how we think we'll be able to add value over the next decade as opposed to the past 100 years.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. With the strong level of buybacks, why is share count not noticeably declining from 1Q?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","It really relates to the timing of the repurchases and the impact it's had on the weighted shares. So, the difference in the weighted average share count between Q1 and Q2 was just over 700,000 shares. And again, we repurchased 766,000 shares in the quarter, so it really just relates to the timing of when we did those purchases.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Okay, thanks, Andy. Back to John here. What's the outlook for both the air and ocean freight markets in the second half of 2015 and beyond?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, drilling a little deeper into our Global Forwarding division and kind of where our heads are at, I talked about our investments the last three years and how we like our operational capabilities and our go-to-market strategies today in that Global Forwarding business.","We are very confident that we're going to continue to be able to create value and grow that business in the long term. If you recap some of the events over the last year or so, the port strike on the West Coast was a big deal in terms of some of the disruption. We've recently published some whitepaper thoughts around the Panama Canal and all the investment that's happening to change the flow of freight, talked earlier about our airfreight investments and the dynamics between air and ocean. When we kind of put that all together, we've had a great run the last three years with growing our net revenues pretty meaningfully every quarter since the acquisition of Phoenix three years ago. And while we still feel great about the long term, we did comment last year that our comparisons in the third quarter and fourth quarter for the Global Forwarding business will probably be a little bit more challenging because we're comparing to periods of pretty meaningful disruption a year ago.","I commented about airfreight and how that becomes very reactive to the current marketplace and supply chains. So, we're investing in the long-term capabilities and market share gains there, but those results could be a little bit more volatile going forward as well, too.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Okay. Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. Given the plethora of rapidly growing truck brokerage-based logistics companies in the U.S., would you say the competitive intensity is the same or greater than it was five years ago? How would you see the competitive landscape playing out over the next five years?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, we do see some of the competitors growing and pursuing scale through acquisition, as John mentioned, there are more larger competitors today than five years ago. And quite frankly, we welcome the competition; it makes us better.","Our approach, however, which we happen to believe is the right one, has been to focus on our customers by helping them improve their supply chain and drive better results. We know we will always have competitors that can offer brokerage services, but we also know, and quite frankly this is where we're focused, is that there are very few non-asset based competitors that have the people, the network, the processes and the technology to offer the same breadth of services on a global scale.","I happened to have the good fortune of sitting in on a customer presentation yesterday, it's a multibillion-dollar global manufacturer with 26 facilities located across the globe, and they had their entire senior leadership team in on the logistics side for some strategic planning. And our ability to show them the global scale, the in-transit visibility across all different modes of transportation, I think they quickly realized, and we're doing business with them right now, that they can't get that service from any other competitor that's out there.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. LTL volumes excluding Freightquote look to be up 13% year-over-year. This seems well above the market. Can you elaborate?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, this is probably drilling down a little bit into our LTL service line, and I started to go there in the prepared comments. We do believe we're the market leader in terms of 3PL services in the LTL space. And we're investing significantly in our capabilities to go into larger customers and really help them understand the best way to ship that LTL freight.","And as the marketplace move towards more e-commerce and smaller-size shipments, so we think it's an area that's really right for a greater and greater value proposition. We do believe that we can continue to take market share. Those larger integrated customers do have a little bit different business model or relationship with us in terms of the effort and expectation that it takes to understand their business and to make sure that we flow the data and make the best decisions.","A lot of the supply chains change and get more complex and move faster, a lot of the opportunity for us to add value in that space has really been a more effective route guide to make sure that the right types of freight is going to the right people in the right quantities. And we're very proud of the fact that we think the LTL partners that we work with in the marketplace that not only can we add value on the shipper side, but that we can do a better job with those carrier partners by giving them the freight that they really want and makes their network more optimal as well, too.","I think it's just a great example of why the 3PL industry exists and is growing is that in the evolution of supply chains, in a more competitive market, the better intelligence that you can inject into the decision-making and the order management of those LTL cycles, there's opportunity to create value on a number of fronts.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question again for you. What are the major IT initiatives under development presently?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We've only got a few minutes left, and I could probably talk about this for the next hour or so because it is a really important thing. And it starts with the premise that you've heard us talk about our Navisphere platform and the fact that when we think about technology, there are many different areas supporting all of our different divisions and regions where we're trying to make things more productive and, maybe more importantly, integrate with our customers in a more effective way to add value like I just described on the LTL front.","The things that probably aren't as visible to everybody else relate heavily to how those different capabilities and services tie together in that Navisphere platform because the power of that is it allows us to give customer visibility across their types of services or businesses. It also gives the foundation for optimization and mode selection around the different things that we're doing, collecting all of the information regardless of region or mode in the same data warehouse, feeds the analytics that are a really important part.","So we've got initiatives in the analytical area to help our customers and capacity providers understand their business and our relationship with them better. We've got productivity and operational enhancements in each of the divisions and a number of technical initiatives to make sure that everything ties together and executes as effectively as we wanted to. Putting that altogether, it's really our goal that Navisphere is an industry-leading transportation management system, or TMS as it's referred to, that is both an asset for us as a business and also something that we can extend to our customers and carriers in a way to increase their competitive advantage too.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. Personnel expense leverage was favorable in the quarter, with net revenue increasing 12% and operating expenses just under 11%. Given the higher EPS growth in the first half, does variable compensation accelerate going forward or do you expect personnel expenses to grow in line with head count during the second half? Are there any other factors we should be considering with respect to personnel expense growth?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, we would expect personnel expenses to grow equal to or slightly less than net revenue growth. That's always been our objective. Typically, we would expect head count to grow more in line with volume, though over the past six quarters, we've been able to grow volume at a faster pace than head count. As far as variable compensation accelerating, we don't expect that as we had a good growth in the third quarter and fourth quarter last year. And finally, we don't have any additional \u2013 pardon me, we do have additional head count \u2013 Freightquote, but the base Robinson business should not see an acceleration.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Given the excellent first half performance against a mediocre economic backdrop, have you considered changing the 7% to 12% EPS growth rate targets laid out at your last Analyst Day in New York? With 200 basis points of that growth coming from share repurchases, is the core 5% to 10% growth objective now too conservative?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","When we delivered that long-term, double-digit EPS growth goal, we talked about the fact that that really did not factor into significant acquisitions, really. We have some history of smaller acquisitions supplementing our growth, but I think some of our enhanced performance more recently has come from a couple of good investments that have really paid off and that our comments and the transparency that we're giving you to the legacy business and those trends, I think, probably do support may be more the Investor Day, longer-range guidance that we gave.","So, I think that still is the right long-term message that we're sticking with and the comments I shared earlier about the GDP, the marketplace and customer outlook probably weighs into that a little bit.","When you put it all together, we will continue to look for opportunities to exceed our long-term guidance and hopefully create more value. But I think that's an appropriate message for us to keep our investors and potential investors focused on for now.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. This will be the last question for Andy. When do you plan to conduct your next Analyst Day? It seems that they should be more frequent than they have been.","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, we've had two Investor Days since becoming a public company. And I like the approach that John, Chad, Angie, and Tim have taken in the past about holding Investor Day when there are important topics to present to investors and gaining feedback. And going forward, I'll be working with John and Tim to build the current RR (59:44) program and I would not rule out an Investor Day in 2016.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. So unfortunately, we're out of time and we apologize that we couldn't get to all of the questions today. Thank you for participating in our Second Quarter 2015 Conference Call. This call will be available for replay in the Investor Relations section of the C.H.

(NASDAQ:CHRW) Q4 2015 Earnings Call February  3, 2016  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson Fourth Quarter 2015 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, Tim Gagnon will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions.","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 3, 2016.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, the Director of Investor Relations.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone.","On our call this morning will be John Wiehoff, our Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Clarke, Chief Financial Officer. John and Andy will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year of 2015. And we'll follow that with the response to pre-submitted questions we received after earnings release yesterday.","Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate the discussion. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Andy will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments.","I'd like to remind you that comments made by John, Andy, or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","With that, I'll turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments on slide three, with a review of our fourth quarter results.","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Tim, and thanks, for everybody taking the time to listen to the call this morning. I'm going to start by highlighting a few of the financial metrics that we look at, and then maybe share a few headline thoughts before turning it over to Andy.","In terms of financial metrics, on slide three that Tim referenced, if you look at our total revenues for the quarter, we're down 4.4%, similar to the rest of the year. The total revenues grew at a slower pace, primarily due to the cost of fuel and the reduction of fuel surcharges in our services. In the fourth quarter, we also seen \u2013 did see some decline in prices that result in reduced total revenues.","Total net revenues increased 13.7% in the quarter. As the slide indicates, 7.3% growth came from our organic growth, while the Freightquote acquisition contributed about 6.5 percentage points to that growth. Income from operations for the quarter was up 14.3%, and net income was up 12%. Earnings per share of $0.88 compared to earnings per share of $0.77 last year.","Wanted to share just a couple of comments on the difference between income from operations and net income, and the comment that's noted on slide four about the indemnification asset. When we acquired Phoenix three years ago, there were some uncertain tax positions around the world that we received an indemnification promise from the sellers. The purchase accounting for that is to record indemnification receivable as well as a contingent tax liability for the issues that were uncertain.","If those issues are all resolved without any obligations, both the receivable and the contingent liability would come back off the balance sheet without any cash charges or any net impact to earnings. The nuance with the accounting for that is the receivable comes off when the indemnification period ends, and the tax liabilities come off when the statute of limitation passes in all the various countries that they apply to.","So, what we saw during the fourth quarter was a $7.1 million indemnification asset write-off that went to other expense, that's the reversal of the receivable that was recorded, which is a non-cash charge. We also saw a portion of the tax liabilities come off the balance sheet as well and reduced the tax provision. And the rest of the tax liabilities will come off in future periods, as those statute of limitations pass. So, a little bit unusual, but it does result in a $7 million other expense charge that, net of those tax liabilities that reversed, did have a negative impact of $0.02 per share on the quarter. That results in a different growth rate in net income compared to income from operations for the quarter.","In terms of other financial metrics down on the bottom of that slide, we talk about our team and our head count. We finished the year with 13,159 employees, which represents a little over 14% increase from the previous year. Just under 1,000 of those employees joined us through the Freightquote acquisitions, and the remainder came from organic growth of staffing up our teams across the network.","If you look at the year to date results, which is always good to do, because we do have a fair amount of incentive contracts and other things that apply on an annual basis still, we did complete 2015 with year to date results that reflected 15% EPS growth. That represents our second year of 15% EPS growth, and something that we're very proud of.","If you look at \u2013 almost all of the year to date financial metrics represent records in terms of size and scale of Robinson. And we're proud of our performance. And Robinson is a bigger and stronger business today, in just about every financial metric that you can look at. I want to take this moment to thank the Robinson team. We've had to adapt and change a lot to a changing marketplace and a changing industry over the last several years, and we're doing that, and we feel very good about the strength of our team and the results that we achieved in 2015. So, those are the financial metrics that I'll highlight.","Just a few other headline thoughts, again, before I turn it over to Andy. I mentioned Freightquote already. Once in the last few quarters, we've talked about that. As a reminder, we closed that acquisition on January 1st of 2015, so this will be the last quarter, where Freightquote's inclusion will be highlighted. We've been doing that simply to be transparent around the impact of those acquired revenues, and the acquired impacts of Freightquote. But we're very pleased with that acquisition. Similar to what we said in previous quarters, we're happy with what we've achieved there. We have a little bit more work to do in terms of integrating the business and going forward, but year one was a success. And, hopefully, the impact of Freightquote to our financials has been clear throughout the year.","The other thought that I would share is with regards to pricing. When you look through the deck, and Andy gives the comments on our various services, you'll see a lot of down arrows on pricing. We talked in our last call about softening markets and softening pricing, and I don't think it's any surprise to anyone that over the last quarter, pretty much in all of our services that demand has been softening, and that has resulted in price declines.","We've talked a lot \u2013 if you look at the last couple of years now, 2014 and 2015, last year, we had some pretty meaningful price increases in all of our services, particularly, in the truckload area. And now, this year, we're seeing a more typical cycling or turning-down of some of those prices. That's an important change that we have to adapt to, and we'll do the best we can to give you our color on kind of what we're seeing in the market and how we adjust our business to do that.","But as a reminder, we really think of our value creation in the long term around taking market share and helping our customers and suppliers adapt to those changing market conditions. So, while it is a pretty relevant change to what's going on in the market, it's nothing that we haven't experienced before and is part of how we think we can add value to the marketplace in a declining price market.","So, I'll stop there with those headline thoughts and turn it over to Andy to walk you through the deck of our financials.","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, John. I also want to echo your comments about our fourth quarter and full year. 2015 was a great year for Robinson, and our people are and should be very proud of these results. While it was a different transportation market than 2014, our global network continues to prove that we can provide excellent service to our customers and deliver strong results for our shareholders in any condition.","This industry continues to change and evolve and will do so at an increasing pace in the years to come. We like that, because we have been disrupting and innovating for years. Today, approximately 72% of our customer shipments originate from either an electronic or digital transaction or is web or mobile-based. We have connections with well over 150,000 organizations and execute over 5 million web or mobile interactions a month with customers and carriers. These customers and carriers rely on us to lead, and that is exactly what we are doing, and I think these results reflect that.","So, I will start my review of the detailed result on slide four with our transportation. Transportation net revenues increased 13.8% to $544 million in the quarter. We finished the full year with a 13.5% net revenue growth, driven in part by our 14% growth in global shipment count to approximately 17 million shipments in 2015. Fourth quarter transportation net revenue margin increased 310 basis points from 2014's fourth quarter to 19%.","From historical perspective, it is our best net revenue margin quarter since Q4 2008. This increase was a result of the impact of lower transportation costs in most of the transportation modes, including the decrease in fuel prices when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The chart in this page shows our transportation net revenue margin for the past 10 years, representing multiple economic and industry cycles. It is a combination of our people, process, and technology that produced these best-in-class results on a consistent and sustainable basis.","Moving on to slide five and our truckload results. We had another strong quarter in our truckload business, growing net revenues by 13.4%. Organic net revenue increased approximately 10%, while Freightquote added approximately 3.5% to the net revenues in the quarter. Truckload volume increased 5%, with organic volume of approximately 2%, and Freightquote adding approximately 3%. By comparison, Cass volumes were down approximately 2.5% in the fourth quarter. We feel good about our ability to profitably grow volumes and take market share. In fact, we've done that for 26 consecutive quarters.","In North America, the linehaul price per mile to our customers, excluding the impact of fuel, was down 3% on a year-over-year basis, while the cost paid to carriers decreased approximately 5%. From historical perspective, since 2008, the average increase in pricing to customers has been 2.5%. During that same eight-year period, the price paid to carriers has risen 2.5%. There has been and probably always will be short-term volatility between these two numbers, but over a longer period of time, they tend to converge. In real time, we are seeing the pricing in the spot market have a larger impact on changes in overall pricing than in the previous quarters in the year.","Our volume growth in the quarter, and for most of the year in 2015, came from our committed business, with transactional volume down on a year-over-year basis, as you would expect. The demand environment in the second half of 2015 was softer than in the first half when compared to 2014. Thus far, in 2016, our volume growth is similar to what we saw in the second half of 2015. John will talk more about that in his closing comments.","Moving on to slide six and the less-than-truckload results. Our LTL net revenues increased 41.4%, with organic net revenues increasing approximately 9% and Freightquote contributing approximately 32% in the fourth quarter. LTL volumes increased 36%, with organic contributing 17% and Freightquote adding approximately 19%.","Net revenue margin increased on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of higher-margin Freightquote business with small customers and growth in our consolidation business. For the year, LTL net revenues are up nearly 40%, driven by strong organic and Freightquote contributions. We are the largest non-asset LTL provider in North America by a wide margin, and our go-to-market strategy has proven to be a winning one with customers and providers.","Transitioning to intermodal results on slide seven. Intermodal net revenue decreased 13.7% in the fourth quarter, with volumes down 8%. Without Freightquote, organic net revenues decreased approximately 22% in the fourth quarter. It was a tough fourth quarter in the intermodal business, as we had a significant decrease in our transactional volumes. The intermodal services represents less than 2% of our net revenues, and we typically see the results impacted negatively in a softer truckload market with lower fuel prices. These market conditions often impact the decision of shippers to utilize truckload services rather than intermodal.","Moving to slide eight and a review of our global forwarding business. Net revenue for the global forwarding services decreased 2.1% in the fourth quarter. Ocean net revenues decreased 1.5%,, while air decreased 4.1%, and custom services were down 1.3%.","There are two things in the quarter to highlight. The first is that we continue to capture market share in global forwarding. Volumes were up in ocean, and up slightly in air, despite a very challenging marketplace. Pricing, however, in both ocean and air continue to be a major headwind, with both down double digits in the quarter. The second issue to reflect is that it's important to remember the strong Q4 2014 comparable, which was driven by the West Coast port strikes, where net revenue grew 18% in that particular period.","The 2015 full year results were very positive on both top and bottom lines, and our global forwarding team has done an excellent job. We've got a great team, and are confident in the platform and how we are positioned for the future.","Slide nine and our other logistics services. The services in this group include transportation management services, warehousing, parcel and small package. Net revenues increased 16.1% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Managed services, primarily our TMS offering branded TMC, represents over half of the net revenue in this area, and that business is performing extremely well with strong net revenue growth. TMC finished the year with a record number of new implementations and the pipeline for pending implementations is at an all-time high.","Transitioning to our sourcing business on slide 10. Our sourcing net revenues increased 11.9% in the fourth quarter, and case volume grew 4.5%. We are pleased with the sourcing team's ability to finish the year strong in the fourth quarter and grow net revenues just short of 5% for the year. Our customer base is very concentrated, with retail and food services customers representing our two largest segments. The sourcing team continues to adapt the value proposition and they have done a good job working through a tough couple of years, with a lot of change in both our services and how we meet the needs of our top customers.","Slide 11 covers our summarized income statements for the fourth quarter. Operating income increased 14.3% in the fourth quarter, and as a percent of net revenue was 37.6%, up 20 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. For the year, operating income as a percent of net revenue increased 50 basis points to 37.8%. Thank you to all of our people for another strong productivity year.","Personnel expenses were up 14.1% in the quarter. This increased personnel expense was due to the additional head count relating to our acquisition of Freightquote, contributing approximately 9.1% and a 5% increase in our organic head count. Other SG&A expenses increased 11.4%. This increase again was primarily due to the Freightquote acquisition, including amortization expense of $1.9 million. John mentioned earlier that we had an interest and other expense increase during the quarter by $7.1 million. That expense was partially offset by the related tax liabilities, decreasing earnings per share by $0.02 in the fourth quarter.","Moving on to slide 11 (sic) [12] and other financial information. We had a great cash flow quarter, generating just over $253 million in the period. Year-to-date cash flow was $718 million, a 40% increase versus last year. Capital expenditures were $11.8 million in the fourth quarter and year to date, $44 million. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be between $70 million and $80 million, with $30 million coming from our new data center. We finished the fourth quarter with $950 million in debt and just under $170 million in cash.","And finally, before turning it back to John, on to slide 13 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $130 million to shareholders in the quarter, with approximately $64 million coming from dividends and $66 million in share repurchases. We finished the quarter returning approximately 103% of net income to shareholders, and for the year, we returned 92%, which is in line with our target. Since 2010, we've returned over $3.1 billion to shareholders in dividend and share repurchases.","Again, our thanks to everyone at Robinson for a great quarter in 2015, and thank you all as well for listening in. With that, I will turn it back to John for his closing comments.","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks, Andy. So slide 14, labeled a look ahead, is just some bullet points that we laid out to kind of share with you what we're seeing and what our headline thoughts are heading into 2016.","To start with, our January total company net revenue organic growth rate is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2015. As I mentioned earlier, Freightquote has lapped, so the impact of Freightquote in 2015 would not reoccur again this year. But basically, what we saw in January was a continued soft transactional market and continued margin expansion on our committed freight, very similar to what Andy laid out for Q4 of 2015.","What is our mindset and how are we thinking about 2016? I mentioned in my kickoff comments that our long-term value proposition and how we think about growing the business is to be very focused on taking share, knowing that there's going to be different periods of different environments and different pricing scenarios, but that is absolutely what we're focused on in 2016.","We put the word profitably on there. It's important from our standpoint that when we think about how we go to market and how we want to grow our business, that when we enter into a committed relationship and are trying to add value to the customers in the marketplace on a longer term basis, that those relationships are sustainable, and that we're getting compensated for what we're doing, and that we're adding value to the customer on a long-term basis. In the transactional world, again, there's not a lot of point in executing transactional business if you can't get a return on it. So when we think about how we go to market, it makes sense for us to think about how we can add value and go after market share in a sustainable way. We think we've done that in our past, and that will continue to be our mindset going forward.","Global forwarding success, Andy touched on the results that we had and why we feel good about our global forwarding team and our global forwarding success. And I think as \u2013 the next two points really go together around integrated services and global forwarding, but we've talked a lot the last three years \u2013 three years ago we weren't as proud or content with our competitive positioning in global forwarding. With the Phoenix acquisition and the further investment over the last three years, we've been able to grow our net rev \u2013 combined net revenues high single digits over that period of time, and really improve our service offering and our capabilities.","And it's not only been a good investment but I think it's been a very important expansion of what Robinson is capable of, and allowing our cross-selling services and allowing us to look at other regions of the world and how we can build further on to our network. So we're very focused on that continuation of cross-selling, looking at international air, ocean and customs brokerage in other regions and really leveraging the platform we've built over the last three years as an important part of our thoughts going forward.","The demand for integrated global services is growing. That's probably not a new thought to most people. But just to share with you that when we look at our customer metrics in our business that we do see an escalation of the number of customers that are using multiple services. Andy mentioned the growth in the pipeline in our managed services division, and we've talked about cross-selling of some of our international and domestic stuff. There's a lot of data points and a lot of metrics that point to our continued success in working on a more global basis and working with more integrated customers, so we do feel that's an important trend that we're going to stay focused on.","Another point related to that, though, that we have emphasized and continued to believe is very important is that all of the services that we offer are very competitive, and do require competitive pricing and service levels in order to be successful. So when we think about the pace and how aggressively we expand those services and expand those geographies, it is balanced by wanting to retain our market leadership position in a high-quality, high-service and competitive price profile as we move into each of those.","We also have talked about we do believe it's important to maintain both a transactional and a committed or contractual presence in the marketplace. So as we grow with those bigger, more global, and integrated opportunities, we also are staying focused on how to remain competitive in the transactional marketplace and balancing the different types of relationships and segment offerings that we have with our customers. So that's a little bit of insight into how we're thinking about our offerings and expanding our profile and our platform going into the year, and increasing those global integrated services.","The last point is really repetitive from things that we've been emphasizing for a long time. We've talked about people, process, and technology and really believing that that is the competitive foundation of the things that really matter in the forwarding and 3PL sector that we're going to continue to focus on. Our people have always been our primary asset and will remain that. Our talent and our account managers and how we go to market are just really what we think makes a difference in whether we succeed or fail at Robinson, and will continue to be our primary asset that we invest in.","Technology is as important as ever. A lot of focus and emphasis around technology disruption and the impact that it's having on our industry. We believe we're a technology leader and we're going to continue to invest in our Navisphere platform and continue to maintain that competitive advantage that we think is really important in the marketplace.","Our business processes are very important. Sometimes it's about bringing consistency and discipline to those processes and at other times it's about innovation and new ideas that customers are looking to try to make changes, or to improve or to take costs out of their supply chain. And that talent, technology, and innovation, people, process, technology focus, we're as convinced as ever that that is the differentiator at Robinson and that is what we're going to continue to invest in to make a difference in the marketplace.","Those are our prepared thoughts. With that, I will turn it over to Tim to facilitate some prepared Q&A.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. And before I get into the Q&A here, I'd like to thank all the analysts and investors for taking the time to submit some great questions and done my best to compile them here into themes that are relevant and important. I'll frame up the questions for John and Andy, and then they'll prepare their response. So I'll get right into it here.","Question-and-Answer Session","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","The first question is for Andy around truckload pricing. North America truckload pricing to CHRW customers was down 3% year over year, while transportation costs per mile declined 5%, a spread that widened more significantly during the fourth quarter when compared to earlier this year. Has this spread widened, narrowed or remained relatively the same in January?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","What we've seen in January is it has remained relatively the same. There's been no material change one way or the other from what we saw in the fourth quarter.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. The next question is for John. Trying to read the tea leaves; how are you feeling about the macro environment today? Any changes in your customer tone and any differentiation between large or small customers?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","From a macro standpoint, I would say the softening of the market and the decrease in prices is probably the predominant theme that everybody is focused on, just how long will the market stay soft and what type of environment will we be in throughout the remainder of 2016. Listening to that question, I would say the other thing that probably comes to mind is that from a macro standpoint, we've been trying hard to analyze our business from a industry and vertical standpoint more and more, and probably not surprisingly, when you look across the vertical sectors in Robinson, is where you would see some of the higher correlations to the economy and where things are at. Anything energy or mining related obviously very soft, and even in those regions where that's focused, less activity going on.","In the retail world, there's a lot of transition, a lot of increase in e-commerce, a lot of store closings, a lot of transition that's going on in the retail world. We're still fairly big in food and beverage, which is a little bit more stable than a lot of the other sectors. Our automotive business is still remaining pretty good in North America but that industry has continued to do fairly well, so again, not shocking or surprising given the headlines and the types of things that are happening in the U.S. and around the world, but I would say that our freight activities probably validate some of the headlines that you see about what's happening in the overall economy.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. The next question's for Andy around contractual pricing in truckload. Can you comment on the rate increases or decreases that you are seeing in your contractual book of business for 2016? Asked another way, are shippers demanding and getting rate concessions, or are you able to maintain or even modestly increase your rates as you go through the bid process?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks. We are currently having a balanced discussion with our contractual customers in this area. On the one hand, you've got regulations such as ELD that'll drive up the cost of transportation later in the year and in 2017, and shippers are aware of that. At the same time, the current spot market has softened from a year ago and we are aware of that. Things such as origin-destination pairs as well as mix of freight are considered when deciding rates and our people are working every day to reach out and get the best solution for our customers and our company.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Okay , thanks, Andy. Next question for John. It appears you're still in hiring mode, which you promised to do in 2015 to regain some market share. With an uncertain macro picture, how do you see your hiring plans in 2016?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It is our current intention that we do plan to continue to hire in 2016. We have a lot of productivity initiatives and various focus points that we have to try to increase our productivity and build our business by being more productive and being more efficient, but as I said earlier, people are the core asset and we know that we're more successful when we go to market with good people who are talented and trained in what they need to do. So we are continuing to plan to hire in 2016, and we'll obviously adjust if the market conditions change significantly. But at this point, it's our intent that we'll be able to hire mid single digit increases of people and grow our network and strengthen our team.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. With the implementation of ELDs, what is your outlook for longer term truckload pricing?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks. As we referenced in our prepared remarks, our price to carriers has risen on average 2.5% since 2008, which includes different economic cycles and regulations. That rate of increase is reflective of what has happened in the industry overall and we would expect ELDs to cause long-term truckload pricing to rise and that increase to be influenced by many different factors, both positive and negative, such as GDP, capacity and the like.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. How does the current market environment compare to that seen in 2011 and 2012? Does it look like we are approaching a supply-demand equilibrium at the current tempered freight levels? And if so, how will this impact your net margins?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","If you go back \u2013 and this question's around North American truckload \u2013 and if you go back and look at our activity over the last five years or six years, throughout 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, we talked a lot about it being a little bit unusual in an extended period of time where there was a fairly balanced market. That balanced market ended with some weather and some meaningful price increases in late 2013, 2014, and now what we're seeing in 2015 is, towards the end of the year, some of that double digit price increase, especially in the transactional market, being given back. So, yeah, from a standpoint of 2014 being a tighter market and some aggressive price increases and now some of those coming back, we are probably moving back more towards a midpoint around the balance of supply and demand in the marketplace.","What I think is different, though, is that a lot of the way we talked about our business back in 2011 and 2012 was during a sustained period of a balanced market. There became some different dynamics around route guides and how important it was to be near the top of the route guide and how we had to aggressively go after share in a fairly sustained balanced market for a long period of time.","It's too early to know what the rest of even 2016 is going to be like, much less 2017 or 2018. So I don't think it's fair to conclude that we're back into a sustained balanced market. We'll have to see how the rest of 2016 plays out and what the next couple of years look like to know if we're going back into an environment like we saw in 2011 and 2012.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. What is the outlook for share repurchases moving forward? And what is the hierarchy for uses of cash?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, the hierarchy for the uses of cash is number one, continue to invest in the business, as that capital generates significant ROI. Number two, strategic acquisitions. Between Phoenix and Freightquote, which have occurred over the last three years, we've invested over $1 billion and are very pleased with the returns on those investments. And, number three, return capital to shareholders, which we've done, over $3.1 billion since 2010.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. Next question back to John. Can you discuss the current competitive environment in truck brokerage and are you concerned about other participants being willing to do the same business for a significantly smaller margin going forward? Who provides the greatest threat, other pure truck brokers or asset-intensive carriers with ancillary truck brokerage operation? Has the competitive environment improved with the acquisition of other competitors?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","With regard to the competitive landscape, we've acknowledged, and there's been a lot of discussion over the last probably five years around the increase in competition. Almost every committed bid that we work on will have dozens of providers, and lots of carriers, lots of other 3PLs, and the market remains very competitive. So we continue to see a very competitive marketplace with a lot of people out there.","I commented earlier in our prepared comments that we take a approach around sustainability and profitability, and whenever somebody is aggressively going after market share with a different attitude towards profitability or sustainability, it can have an impact that we have to try to understand that and make sure that we're not overreacting or mispricing our services, or doing things that we don't intend to do because others are taking a different go to market strategy in terms of what they're doing. So we do have to watch out for that.","But I think, for the most part, the vast majority of the competitors have a similar attitude, and I've continued to work on that. We haven't seen a lot of change this year in the competitive landscape. Again, whenever the market is moving and it's softening like it has, there will be a lot of transition and a lot of bid activity. But with thousands of competitors in a very fragmented market, it's hard to see any unique changes in a short period of time. So I would say there's nothing really unusual about what we've experienced this year.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. Can you discuss how North America year-over-year organic truckload volume growth trended on a monthly basis through the fourth quarter, and thus far into the first quarter?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. Truckload volume for the quarter was pretty consistent throughout, up 2% per business day in each of the months. And January has continued at that same trend.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Can you speak to the challenges facing your intermodal business in the current market? Would you expect your intermodal volumes to remain under pressure until truckload rates begin to rise?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Short answer is yes. We've talked a lot about our intermodal business and the competitive positioning of it over the past several years. What we have today is a capable team. We understand the service, and we compete primarily in that multimodal freight that can typically be served by either truck or intermodal services. We feel like we do a good job of making certain that our customers get exposure to intermodal opportunities and pricing when that's appropriate.","What we've confessed in the past is that what we don't have is the density of high-volume, committed freight in all intermodal lanes, or the dedicated equipment that is sometimes the most effective way to serve those dense corridors and those more committed areas. That's something that we continue to work on and still aspire to be better at in the future. So as our business continues to transition and hopefully strengthen ourselves, in terms of dedicated and committed relationships on the intermodal front, we will continue to see more fluctuations in transactional shipments based upon the market conditions.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. Air freight and ocean freight net revenue growth \u2013 around that net revenue growth. Cross-selling initiatives are noted in the prepared remarks, but are you disappointed in the rate of growth given their relative lack of size and the completion of Phoenix's integration?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","We're not disappointed at all. In fact, we're very pleased. So as John mentioned, you go back three years ago when we acquired Phoenix and merged it with our global forwarding operation, particularly, I think if you look at any other acquisition that's been done in the space, there are a lot of examples of how not to do it. A lot of businesses that have been significantly disrupted. And we've continued to grow both what I'll call traditional Phoenix and traditional Robinson global forwarding business. And what we've tried to do, on a very thoughtful and deliberate basis, is merge those two entities across the globe in a way that was in no way, shape, or form disruptive to our organization.","And so, today, we actually have a significantly stronger global forwarding operation located throughout the globe, with people all over the world doing pretty good things. So, again, we're really pleased with the progress of our global forwarding team, the results that we're making, and that cross-selling is really \u2013 it's already taken hold, but it's beginning to accelerate.","And one of the key aspects of that as well, as John mentioned, is our global platform, Navisphere. So, when you bring everybody onto one platform, you're able to provide that visibility, end to end across the globe with all of our customers. And I would argue that there are very few people that can actually \u2013 a lot of people say they can do it, but very few people can actually back that up and do it. And I think what we've said and what we've done has been very deliberate in that regard, and the success we're seeing today, not only in 2015, but it's continuing into 2016, is there.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John around our carrier base. Can you break down the percentage of Robinson's freight hauled by large, medium, and small carriers?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We've showed some pie charts about this in the past, and they really haven't changed over the last five years or six years. If you look at, we define a large carrier as somebody who has more than 400 pieces of equipment, and that group constitutes a couple of percent of our interaction with the capacity side. Carriers that have 100 pieces of equipment or less constitute more than 90% of the activity \u2013 the truckload shipments in North America that we do. So, we have an active carrier list that, at the end of the year, was increased to 68,000 carriers. And that fragmented marketplace and those, I guess it depends upon your definition of medium and small, but to us, 100 pieces of equipment all the way down to that individual true owner\/operator with one truck, that is the backbone of our truckload capacity, and continues to be a very similar mix today that it's been over the last couple of decades.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Staying on the topic of our carriers, for Andy. How many truckload carriers did Robinson add in the fourth quarter of 2015, and has the company seen any changes to fleet sizes year to date?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","We've added another 2,700 new carriers during the fourth quarter, which was up 13% from the fourth quarter of 2014. It's another great job by our network and carrier relations team throughout all of 2015, which brought in over 11,500 carriers, representing over 40,000 tractors. So no material change in terms of the fleet composition.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. For John, what is the best environment from a volume and capacity standpoint for Robinson operationally and financially?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I commented earlier about our commitment to both a transactional presence and a committed or contractual. And when you think about the years in our history where we've had really significant growth, it was environments where there was a lot of economic growth and a lot of continued opportunity in the marketplace, where, in those longer term committed relationships, we have a high degree of volume and we're able to take market share and expand those committed relationships. While at the same time, there's a very robust market of transactional opportunities and unexpected freight that we can help service in the marketplace as well, too.","So, the very best performance years we've had, from a growth and profitability standpoint is when the economies are growing, the markets are very active, and there's healthy market share opportunities in both committed and transactional relationships that we have in the marketplace.","There's a lot of other market environments like we talked about earlier, where demand will cycle and capacity will cycle, and so supply and demand will lead to price increases and price decreases. And as I've said a couple of times, we'll continue to add value and take market share, and apply our services in whatever environment the marketplace throws at us. But the optimum conditions, which is probably true for a lot of industries and a lot of companies, is overall economic growth and prosperity is a good thing for all of us, and when we see a sustained environment of that, it's probably the best thing.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. To Andy, with our next question. CHRW's leverage ratio ended 2015 at the lower end of its 1 times to 1.5 times debt-to-EBITDA target. How is management thinking about the company's current leverage ratio in light of a more uncertain demand outlook and weighing the potential uses of debt?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","First, 2015 was a fantastic and record year in cash flow, generating nearly $720 million, with over $250 million coming in the fourth quarter alone. Obviously, this had a positive impact on our leverage ratio. Going forward, we would expect that ratio to be back in the 1 times to 1.5 times range. We continue to look at strategic acquisitions. We've done them in the past. We will continue to do them in the future. So, we believe that we are appropriately structured from a capital basis, going forward.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. To John, a truckload question. With the softer spot, are you starting to see any decreases in small carrier capacity? What is your insight into where capacity is headed, given the soft spot, macro uncertainty and pending ELD implementation?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We sort of touched on this in a couple different areas, but really, our \u2013 we have not seen any change in our carrier composition at this point. For the past several decades, there's been a lot of speculation around the extra strain on the small carrier, and whether or not that was going to impact the marketplace as a whole, and whether that would impact our relationships with them.","Some of the regulation that's come into the marketplace over the last six years or seven years around safety and hours of service, and now, the electronic logs that are coming in, there is a cost factor that impacts that capacity in the marketplace. But I \u2013 we're pretty comfortable that similar to a lot of the previously implemented legislation, that it'll get absorbed over time, and that it'll get adapted to by the small carriers.","And I think one of the things that is important to understand too is that while hours of service and some of the safety ratings and some of the electronic logging regulations that have come or are coming into place, one of the other impacts of that is it really is sort of genericizing the capacity out there, where some of the quality differentiations that maybe some of the larger carriers tried to differentiate within the past are not going to be as prevalent. So, while there's a cost issue and a potential productivity issue, we do think that the capacity landscape is going to remain very fragmented, and that in a lot of ways, it will actually improve the quality and the overall blend of capacity that we can utilize in the marketplace.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy, on our net revenue margin. The slide deck says net revenue margin expansion was the result of lower transportation cost, change in mix of business due to faster growth and shorter length of haul, freight, and the addition of Freightquote. Can you break down in three buckets the contribution of each to net revenue margin expansion in 2015?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Certainly. Of the 310 basis point improvement during the quarter, approximately 140 basis points came from the improvement in net revenue per mile, approximately 110 basis points came from fuel, and the remaining 60 basis points came from all other, including Freightquote and air and ocean.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. What is your current spot versus contract mix in the truckload business?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","For those of you who aren't as familiar with our history, if you go back 15 years, 20 years ago, we were almost entirely transactional in a brokerage role, and as we've grown our services and grown our company and have entered into more committed relationships, we've talked about that longer-term trend towards a better balance of committed and contractual relationships, along with our spot market. We continue to believe that there's probably a balance point of around 50\/50. I think last year in 2014 we were probably closer to that 50\/50 balance. In a market like this, in the fourth quarter of 2015, where things are softening, our best metrics would probably say that we're more 60\/40 or a higher percentage of committed or contractual freight that's moving along pre-priced arrangements.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Moving on to the next question around the truckload bid season to Andy. As trucking bidding season is now underway, can you talk a little about where customer pricing is settling in, and how does that compare to capacity cost? Any color to help understand the different moving parts in that net revenue margin number, and how it could trend in the coming quarters?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yup. Following up on John's answer, and as a reminder, we buy almost all of our capacity in the spot market, where there is a lot of volatility. And over the last recent quarters, it's been down, but if you go back for all of 2015, and you look at it quarter-by-quarter basis: first quarter, up 6%; second quarter, up 3%; third quarter, down 1%; fourth quarter, down 5%. So, there is that volatility, and we're very familiar and comfortable in that environment.","On the customer side, as John mentioned, about 60% of our business is committed. And we're having discussions right now, and continue to have discussions, about what price is doing over the longer term. So, capacity, when we buy, is very short-term. Pricing is done. The discussions are over a longer term, usually a one-year period. That being said, we feel really good about our ability to work with our customers to understand what that volatility is doing, and quite frankly, the ability to price into that volatility with them.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Okay, thanks, Andy. And staying on the topic of contractual business, to John, since CHRW has become increasingly reliant on contractual business, can you discuss how CHRW's bid season works with customers, namely, when it begins and ends? And is there any bellwether that set market expectations for pricing?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, when we've talked about our committed relationships in the past, important to remember that the contracts are generally for a calendar year, but most of them will have evergreen clauses in them. And one of the things that virtually all shippers retain the privilege of deciding when and if they're going to rebid their committed or contractual pricing. So, when we look across our book of rates and contracts, there will be some that have been in place for years that we and the customer are continuing to live by. And in other instances, those customers will have a very rigid annual cycle or a more systematic approach towards how and when they rebid those services.","Even when a shipper rebids their contracts or committed pricing, they may or may not include all of the freight. There's another step in the process to determine based on market conditions and their service levels around what they would want to do. So, for us, it's a very fluid process. There are bids going on at any point during the year. There are more of them going on this time of year than in others, but there really is no single bellwether or month. It's very much of an ongoing evolution, based on supply and demand conditions, as to when either providers are giving 30-day notice and opting out or when shippers are choosing to rebid the contracts in the marketplace.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John, and back to you with the next question here on cross-selling. Can you please give us an update on your cross-selling efforts, as they relate to both Phoenix and Freightquote?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Andy sort of set the table with Phoenix that from a global forwarding standpoint, when we closed the deal three years ago, we really didn't do a lot in the first 12 months. But after that, began a pretty systematic program with Chris O'Brien and his go-to-market team, around looking at our domestic customers, where we know they had global forwarding opportunities and trying to participate aggressively in those bids. And vice-versa, looking at larger global forwarding customers, where we thought we could expand more into domestic services.","We do have metrics that establish that we have been successful with that. There's measured net revenue in relationships that have come in both ways. And as I commented in my prepared comments about the numbers of customers with multiple services and our cross-selling success from our joint account managers, we do feel very good that that's real, and that we've been successful in doing that.","With the Freightquote acquisition, there's probably less specific cross-selling. That business is very transactional. And I think the theme that we've talked more about there is really more us having a clearer segmentation strategy, that in our LTL business, while we've been very comfortable with how we've grown it over the last decade, we have gravitated more towards committed relationships with higher volume shippers, because that was really our expertise and capability. And our account management structure really didn't facilitate an efficient interface with a small shipper who wanted to spend a lot of time price shopping and doing other things that a more typical, smaller transactional customer would do.","So, what's been positive about the Phoenix \u2013 or I'm sorry, about the Freightquote acquisition this year is really helping us evolve into a clearer segmentation strategy, where the true transactional smaller shippers, especially the LTL, but also truckload, are leads and opportunities that we can put more under the Freightquote brand that has established a very efficient front-end and interface with customers for doing that. And then allowing the traditional Robinson network to focus more on the medium and larger customers, where we're investing our account management resources and a little bit more cost-intensive approach to provide the service that's required for those relationships. So, a little bit different in terms of the way we're going after the synergies and the growth, but feeling good about both of them, that they've been good additions to the Robinson network and have made us stronger.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy around productivity. You've been able to grow operating income faster than net revenue for a few quarters in a row now, which is a nice trend. Are there things that you are doing different to amplify the leverage in the model? And how much more is there to go? How sustainable do you think that is, especially if we start to see net revenue margin compression in 2016?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks. One of the great stories of Robinson, and there are many, is the office network. We currently have about 270 offices spread across the globe in global forwarding, North American Surface Trans, PMC, sourcing and the like. Inside each of those offices are great people and great leaders that manage productivity expenses at the local level.","It helps that a majority of our compensation is variable and our people do an excellent job of managing for balanced growth on both the top and bottom line. So, the credit obviously goes to them for the great job and great work that they're doing of improving productivity, managing to balance growth across the network, and improving that ratio.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. To John, question about our sourcing business. The sourcing business was stronger than we were expecting. Is that business back on track, or was there anything unusual in the fourth quarter that we shouldn't assume will continue into 2016?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","With regards to our Robinson Fresh business and the produce sourcing activity that we do, as a reminder, I think Andy stated earlier that there's a pretty concentrated customer base there, and we also have a fair amount of concentration in certain commodities like melons and others that we have unique expertise in, that we do a lot of activity. So what will happen in any period of time is that there will be some volatility in the results relative to the weather and the crop yields, and just the amount of freight and activity that comes out of it.","That Fresh group also provides a lot of temperature-controlled transportation within the Robinson network. So, at any point in time, we're working with those retailers and foodservice companies to not only provide temp-controlled transportation but also product for them, where we can source and supply the Fresh product into their network.","Because of the customer concentration over the past six years, seven years, we've had a couple of instances where we knew that larger customers were not going to be sourcing certain commodities from us in the future, so we've cautioned that some of the declines were foreseeable, that we could see them. At this point, we do think our Robinson Fresh sourcing business is at a normal activity level. We don't see \u2013 we're not aware of any losses or things that we expect in terms of customer declines, so we hope this type of activity in the fourth quarter would be normal.","But again back to the normal caveat that it is a very weather-sensitive business, and a lot of these commodities can fluctuate up and down in unforeseen ways pretty quickly. So there will continue to be a little bit more volatility in the sourcing line item of our revenues.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. And this will be the last question for Andy around our truckload business, a little bit deeper cut on volume. Organic volume growth in truckload for the year was a fairly decent 3%. Given the limited spot market opportunities, where did most of the increase come from?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, following up on John's earlier answer, the majority of that volume growth came from our committed business.

(NASDAQ:CHRW) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call January 29, 2020  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Robert Houghton - Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury","Robert Biesterfeld - Chief Executive Officer","Michael Zechmeister - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson Fourth Quarter 2019 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, Bob Houghton will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, January 29, 2020.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Bob Houghton, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Robert Houghton","Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. On our call today will be Bob Biesterfeld, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Zechmeister, our Chief Financial Officer.","Bob and Mike will provide commentary on our 2019 fourth quarter results. Presentation slides that accompany their remarks can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com. We will follow their comments with responses to the pre-submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday.","I'd like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Biesterfeld","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. I'll get right to the point this morning. Our net revenues, our operating margins, and our earnings per share all finished well below our long-term targets. We've been facing some rather extreme, if not unprecedented, cyclical changes in our North American trucking market.","One year ago, we were experiencing near record net revenue dollars per shipment and double-digit total company net revenue growth. This was followed by a period of rapid price declines, driven by excess capacity and weak demand. The resulting net revenue reported for fourth quarter of 2019 stands another stark contrast to the results of a year-ago.","Higher operating expenses for the quarter, including increased investments in Information Technology, magnified this effect. Mike will provide more context on our operating expenses in the prepared remarks.","To be clear, our fourth quarter results do not reflect our performance expectations going forward. We are committed to our investments in technology, even during more challenging periods in the freight cycle. Our investments this quarter led to operating margins below the low-end of our historical fourth quarter averages.","We are not immune to large swings in the freight market, but we believe our continued advancements through cycles will align the net revenue growth and the operating cost needed to drive operating margin expansion over the long-term. We will continue our focus on cost controls with our target of eliminating $100 million in operating costs over the next three years.","So as we move through mid-2020, we expect that our operating margins will begin to improve. Despite results below our long-term expectations, I do believe that we took some really important steps in the fourth quarter. We continue to adjust our pricing in order to optimize our results. Our fourth quarter decline in truckload net revenue per shipment was largely as anticipated as the fourth quarter of 2018 benefited from contractual pricing in a rapidly falling cost environment, resulting in the highest quarterly truckload net revenue per shipment in the last decade.","On an absolute basis, our fourth quarter truckload net revenue per shipment was very much in line with levels experienced during the balanced freight markets in both 2016 and 2017. Pricing adjustments to reflect the current market helped enable us to deliver flat volume in NAST truckload, including a mid-single-digit increase in contractual volume and 4.5% volume growth in LTL. These are healthy market share gains in a quarter where volumes, as measured by the Cass Freight Index declined approximately 6%.","Our truckload volume trends improved further in January, increasing approximately 6%. We are starting to see our increased investments in technology drive operating efficiency in our business, including a 330 basis point favorable spread between truckload volume growth and headcount growth in our NAST business.","We continue to deliver industry-leading operating margins in the quarter and returned $137 million to our shareholders through a combination of share buybacks and dividends. We generated $212 million in operating cash flow in the fourth quarter. And for the full-year, we generated operating cash flow of $835 million, an all-time high.","During the quarter, our teams continued to excel in areas that we can control, including another quarter of increased win rates on contractual bids in our truckload and LTL service lines and increased awards with our largest customers, while we continue to provide the excellent customer service and innovation that our customers have come to expect from C.H. Robinson.","I am particularly proud of the results we delivered to our customers and carriers and the efforts of our employees to continue to provide supply chain expertise that brings capacity solutions to life for our customers and secure freight and optimize routing for our carriers.","Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Prime Distribution Services, a leading provider of retail consolidation services in North America. We are excited about the scale and the value-added warehouse capabilities that Prime will bring to our existing retail consolidation platform. Prime has a strong leadership team that is experienced in retail consolidation and warehouse operations and we are thrilled to bring the employees, the customers, and the carriers of Prime to C.H. Robinson.","With those introductory remarks, I'll now turn the call over to Mike to review our financial performance.","Michael Zechmeister","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Slide 4, shows our Q4 income statement summary. Fourth quarter total gross revenues decreased 8.3% driven primarily by lower pricing across most transportation services due to the continued soft demand in excess capacity that Bob referenced earlier.","Total company net revenues decreased 18.9% in the quarter led by margin compression in our truckload service line. Q4 monthly net revenues per business day were down 16% in October, down 13% in November, and down 27% in December when compared to the same period last year. The net revenue deterioration in December was driven by performance in the final two weeks of the month where the major holidays fell in the middle of both weeks, leading to a more pronounced decline in commercial activity.","Total Q4 operating income was down 46.5% over last year. Operating margin declined to 1,220 basis points compared to Q4 last year when margins were the highest we had seen in eight quarters. The decline was driven by the drop in net revenue dollars and increased SG&A expenses.","The largest contributors to the SG&A expense increase were increased technology spend and purchased services related to accelerating our growth and cost savings initiatives. Within the SG&A expense in Q4, there were approximately $10 million that we would not expect to be ongoing expense. Diluted earnings per share was $0.73 in Q4, down 45.5% from Q4 last year.","Slide 5 covers other highlights impacting net income. The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 21.4%, an improvement of approximately 250 basis points from the 23.9% rate in Q4 last year. The lower effective tax rate included a benefit of $3.2 million from one-time items, driven primarily by a return to provision true-up in Mexico.","In Q4, we removed our assertion to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is consistent with our change in intent and strategy to repatriate cash in an economically efficient manner. The resulting increase in income tax expense was almost entirely offset by foreign tax credits.","Looking ahead, we expect our 2020 full-year effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. Fourth quarter interest and other expense totaled $10.8 million, up from $9.5 million in Q4 last year. Interest and other expense includes the impact of currency revaluation primarily related to the conversion of working capital and cash balances to the functional currency in each country where those investments reside.","Q4 this year included a $0.9 million unfavorable impact from currency revaluation compared to Q4 last year that included a $2.4 million gain from currency revaluation. Q4 interest expense declined by $1.6 million, driven primarily by overall debt reduction. Average diluted shares outstanding were down 1.8% primarily due to $67.4 million in share repurchases in Q4.","Turning to Slide 6. Cash flow from operations declined to 19.9% versus Q4 last year due primarily to decreased earnings and partially offset by improved working capital. Q4 capital expenditures totaled $19.5 million, which brings full-year capital expenditures to $70.5 million.","We expect 2020 full-year capital expenditures to be between $60 million and $70 million with spending primarily dedicated to technology. Consistent with our previous announcement, we are planning to invest at least $200 million in total technology spending in 2020.","In Q4, we returned approximately $137 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, which represents an 18.5% decrease versus Q4 last year. We have nearly 10 million shares remaining on our current share repurchase authorization and intend to opportunistically repurchase shares to enhance shareholder value.","Now on to some balance sheet highlights on Slide 7. Fourth quarter working capital decreased 17.2% versus the prior year, driven by the decline in net revenues. Our debt balance at quarter end was $1.24 billion, down approximately $111 million versus the end of Q4 last year and our weighted-average interest rate was 4.1% in the quarter compared to 4.0% in Q4 last year.","As Bob mentioned, we're excited about the Prime Distribution Services acquisition and the expanded capabilities that Prime brings to Robinson. We anticipate the acquisition to close by the end of Q1 and plan to finance the acquisition with cash and existing committed financing. While we expect this acquisition to be slightly accretive to EPS in 2020, we would not expect it to have a direct or meaningful impact on the level of share repurchases.","I will wrap up my comments this morning with a look at our volume and net revenue trends in January. While our January truckload volume trends have improved over Q4 levels, the combination of soft demand and excess capacity is keeping pricing well below year-ago levels. January total company net revenues per business day are down approximately 18%.","However, NAST truckload volume is up approximately 6% versus January last year, which would make this our highest NAST truckload volume for a January on record. For reference, in 2019, total company net revenues per business day increased 9% in both January and February and increased 13% in March.","Thanks for listening this morning. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bob to provide some additional context on the business and our segment performance.","Robert Biesterfeld","Thank you, Mike. I'll begin my remarks on our operating segment performance by highlighting the current state of the North America truckload market. On Slide 9, the light and dark blue lines represent the percentage change in NAST truckload rate per mile billed to our customers and cost per mile paid to our contract carriers, excluding fuel costs over the current decade.","During the quarter, both spot market and contractual pricing declined versus year-ago levels. Price per mile billed to our customers declined 11% while cost per mile paid to our contract carriers net of fuel declined 7.5%.","The rate of cost declined moderated on a year-over-year basis versus the third quarter, resulting in net revenue margin compression in the fourth quarter. We do accept that managing cyclicality, price variations, and margin compression in the marketplace is a big part of the 3PL value proposition, particularly with our committed relationships.","Since 2010, the average price and cost net of fuel have each increased approximately 3% annually. So with all the ups and downs, truckload pricing has been more inflationary than the broader U.S. economy.","Our fourth quarter results reflect a shift to contractual volume that is typical for us in a declining price and cost environment, resulting in an approximate mix of 70% contractual and 30% transactional volume in the quarter versus a 65%\/35% mix in a year-ago period.","As we stated before, one of the metrics we use to measure market conditions is the truckload routing guide depth of tender from our Managed Services business, which represents just over $4 billion in freight under management. Average routing guide depth of tender was 1.2 for the fourth consecutive quarter, representing that on average, the first carrier in a shipper's routing guide was executing the shipment in most cases.","This route guide depth remains near the lowest levels we've experienced this decade and contractual routing guides continue to operate with first tender acceptance rates in the high 90% range. Our pricing continues to reflect current market conditions as we work to ensure we're near the top of the route guide headed into 2020.","Turning to Slide 10 in our North American Surface Transportation Business. Fourth quarter NAST net revenues decreased 23.2% driven primarily by the decline in truckload. Our fourth quarter combined to truckload and LTL volumes outpaced year-over-year changes in the Cass Freight Index for the fourth consecutive quarter. Truckload net revenues decreased 29.6% in the quarter driven by margin compression.","As I mentioned earlier, our pricing to customers resulted in lower margins when compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. These were not, however the lowest truckload margins we've seen, but the 29% decline in truckload net revenue per shipment in the quarter is the highest year-over-year decline we've seen in the past decade.","We anticipate facing net revenue per load headwinds throughout the first half of 2020 given the historically high comparables in 2019. Fourth quarter NAST truckload volume was approximately flat versus last year. Our fourth quarter truckload contractual volume increased at mid-single-digit pace.","Through evaluating our performance on annual truckload bids where pricing was completed in the fourth quarter, our win rates nearly doubled when compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. This solid performance and contractual volumes was offset by a double-digit decline in spot market volumes reflecting the continued softness and the transactional portion of the freight market.","During the quarter, we added roughly 3,800 new truckload carriers to our network, which represents a 21% decrease over last year's fourth quarter and a 14% declined sequentially compared to the third quarter of this year. We see this as a clear sign that carriers continue to exit the marketplace.","LTL net revenues decreased 3.4% driven by margin compression. LTL volumes increased 4.5% in the fourth quarter led by growth in new customers. In our intermodal service line, net revenues decreased 3.1% for the quarter.","Slide 11 outlines our NAST operating income performance. Fourth quarter operating income decreased 43.3% while operating margin of 33.4% decreased 1,180 basis points, driven by the net revenue decline, partially offset by reduced variable compensation expense in the quarter. NAST average headcount decreased 3.3% for the quarter and NAST ending headcount is down 5% year-over-year for the full-year.","Slide 12 highlights our Global Forwarding performance. Fourth quarter Global Forwarding net revenues were down 9.6%. Our acquisition of The Space Cargo Group contributed 3 percentage points of net revenue growth in the fourth quarter.","In our ocean service line, net revenues were down 10.6% in the quarter driven by lower pricing. Space Cargo contributed 2 percentage points of net revenue growth. Ocean volumes were down 1.5% in the quarter and fourth quarter air net revenues decreased 12.8% driven by a 7.5% decline in shipments and lower pricing. Space Cargo contributed 6 percentage points of net revenue growth.","Fourth quarter results in both ocean and air were negatively impacted by reduced industry demand due to tariff uncertainty in our highest volume trade lanes from China to the U.S. 2019 Q4 growth rates were also negatively impacted by comparisons to the year-ago period that included shipments to build inventory ahead of tariffs enacted in the first quarter of 2019.","Customs net revenue decreased 3.5% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by lower pricing and a 1% decrease in customs transactions. Space Cargo contributed 1 percentage point to the net revenue growth in the quarter.","Slide 13 outlines our Global Forwarding operating income performance. Fourth quarter operating income decreased 49.5%. Operating margin of 11.7% decreased 920 basis points versus last year driven primarily by lower net revenues and higher SG&A expenses, which was partially offset by lower variable compensation. Average headcount increased 3.4% for the quarter.","Excluding the headcount impact of Space Cargo, our Global Forwarding headcount was flat for the quarter. Over time, we expect to deliver operating margin expansion through a combination of volume growth that exceeds our headcount growth and investments in technology to drive efficiency.","Moving to our All Other and Corporate segment on Slide 14. As a reminder, All Other includes Robinson Fresh, Managed Services, and Surface Transportation outside of North America, as well as other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses.","Fourth quarter Robinson Fresh net revenues were down 15.2% versus last year, primarily due to changes in business mix and lower restaurant traffic at several key food service customers. Case volumes declined 6% in the quarter. Robinson Fresh did generated 630 basis points of operating margin expansion in the quarter, driven by a decline in personnel and service center related expenses.","Fourth quarter Managed Services net revenues increased 5.2% driven by a combination of new customer wins and selling additional services to existing customers. Managed Services operating margin expanded 110 basis points on the quarter.","Other Surface Transportation net revenues declined 0.6% in the quarter, driven by truckload margin compression in Europe, partially offset by an 11% increase in European truckload volume. The acquisition of Dema Service added about 9 percentage points of net revenue growth for the quarter.","On Slide 15, I'm going to wrap up our prepared remarks with a few comments on our go-forward expectations. With the cost of purchase transportation and truckloads still below year-ago levels and continued softness in spot market freight opportunities, North American routing guides are resetting at lower prices versus last year, and this is a trend that we expect to continue.","On a sequential basis, fourth quarter truckload pricing and costs were relatively unchanged and we expect pricing to remain relatively flat sequentially over the next couple of quarters. In our truckload business, we continue to expect net revenue dollars per shipment to remain below year-ago levels through the first half of 2020. And in Global Forwarding, concerns regarding tariffs and fears of recession continue to impact shipper demand.","As I said in my opening remarks, our fourth quarter results are below our long-term targets. With that said, I am confident that we are taking steps to ensure that we continue to meet the needs of our customers, our carriers, and our employees, while we generate strong returns for our shareholders over the long-term horizon. We've reset our pricing to be more competitive with current marketplace conditions, which is driving market share gains in our truckload and LTL service lines.","We're leveraging our increased investments in technology to drive increased employee productivity, and in order to bring innovation to our customers into our carriers. The level of automated truckload carrier bookings doubled and automated customer orders increased by 5 percentage points versus the first quarter of 2019. We are rapidly increasing the occurrence of fully automated bookings in our largest service line.","With a continued focus on lowering our cost to serve and our cost to sell, we do expect to deliver $100 million in operating expense reduction across the enterprise over the next three years. These initiatives will leverage our technology investments to further optimize our network and business operations while at the same time continuing to expand the benefits and the services that we provide to our customers and our carriers.","And with nearly 10 million shares still outstanding on our share repurchase authorization, we will continue to opportunistically repurchase shares to create value for our shareholders.","Regardless of the freight environment, we believe that executing over 18 million shipments a year and having visibility to roughly $100 billion in annual freight spend, give C.H. Robinson an information advantage that creates better outcomes for the nearly 200,000 companies that conduct business on our global platform and provides more rewarding career opportunities for our employees.","We remain firmly committed to leveraging our technology that's built by and for supply chain experts to deliver smarter solutions for our customers and our carriers. We are also firmly committed to the focus areas for our investors, including generating market share gains across all of our services, leveraging our technology investments to reduce our cost to sell and cost to serve while continuing to deliver industry-leading levels of service, and delivering operating margin expansion over time. Finally, I continued to be very proud of our team, and I want to thank them for their efforts that ensure the continued success of our Company.","That concludes our prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator, so we can answer the submitted questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Mr. Houghton, the floor is yours for the Q&A session.","Robert Houghton","Thank you, Donna. First, I would like to thank the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions after our earnings release yesterday.","For today's Q&A session, I will frame up the question and then turn it over to Bob or Mike for a response.","Our first question for Bob comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley asked a similar question. While potentially coincidental, the timing of C.H. Robinson's recent material revenue declines have occurred as technology-focused brokerage platforms from both industry participants and new entrants have increased investments and doubled down on share gaining strategy. Should long-term C.H. Robinson shareholders be concerned by the apparently rapid changing competitive landscape in truck brokerage markets?","Robert Biesterfeld","Thanks, Bob. So what we experienced in fourth quarter was really unprecedented in terms of year-over-year declines in truckload net revenue per load, which really isn't that surprising given the changes that we've seen in the overall market pricing dynamics that occurred in the past couple of years.","As we look back, starting in the fourth quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2018, we saw price increases in the market at really unprecedented levels. And then we saw this pivot in the market and then prices dropped faster than we've ever seen in the past decade. And really all this volatility in the market pricing dynamics has driven a lot of volatility and profit per load, which we\u2019re clearly in the middle of right now.","Our fourth quarter net revenue per load was at the highest that we've seen in over a decade. And that comparison alone makes this quarter\u2019s results look really stark in comparison. So with that as a backdrop, I do want to come back to the direct question on the impact of competition and profitability.","So in order to really peel this back, I think it makes sense to boil things down to what is really the lowest absolute common denominator. And in the case of our truckload business, it's easy to look at this in terms of the net revenue that we earn on a per mile basis, and then look at that compared to points in the past where the market conditions maybe fairly similar.","So as an example, in the 16 quarters from the beginning of 2010 through 2013 the market was largely considered balanced. The routing guide metrics that we always report on showed an average about 1.4 on depth of tender. I'd also call attention to 2016 and 2017. Again, relatively balanced markets with the exception of the uptick at the end of Q4 of 2017 when the market started to heat up a little bit.","Routing guides at that time ranged between 1.3 to 1.6, again, relatively balanced markets. If you look at the average net revenue per mile that C.H. Robinson earned during those 24 quarters of similar market conditions, it is nearly the same net revenue per mile that we earned in the fourth quarter of 2019.","So we know that the competitive landscape was very different in 2010, in 2013 and in 2016 than it is today in terms of both the companies that are involved and the increased focus on technology. And it's clear that supply chains have continued to shift and evolve, but really when you boil it all down to that number of how many cents does C.H. Robinson earned for the value that we create in similar markets, it lands on virtually the same number.","Robert Houghton","The next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Loop Capital. Dave Vernon from Bernstein and Tom Wadewitz with UBS asked a similar question. Mike, the crux of the fourth quarter miss was related to unusually large SG&A spend. Can you please break out how much of the spend increase was related to technology investment? How much to other items, unusual or not? And what this level of SG&A spend should be in 2020?","Michael Zechmeister","Yes, sure. As you know, core to our strategy is our commitment to technology investments of $1 billion over the next five years. Of the $24 million increase in SG&A versus Q4 last year, approximately one-third of that increase was related to external technology investments and we expect to continue to spend that in the near-term.","There were also purchased services related to accelerating our growth and cost savings initiatives over the next three years that will help us bring speed and quality to the implementation of those initiatives. And as I mentioned, we also had approximately $10 million of SG&A expense in the quarter that we would not expect to be ongoing expense.","Robert Houghton","The next question for Bob comes from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Bruce Chan from Stifel asked a similar question. Noting the language of management's expectations for margin improvement over time, do you view the announced $100 million cost reduction initiative as incremental to your efforts to deliver NAST operating leverage? Or more as an offset to the magnitude of the pressure facing the truckload brokerage industry at the moment? Also, is that a net number relative to the 2019 run rate?","Robert Biesterfeld","So as Mike said, most of this $100 million target is an output of the work that has been ongoing within NAST. But each of the business units across the enterprise and the shared services have goals and targets around achieving this $100 million in cost reduction as part of our transformation.","For NAST, this isn't as much of a new initiative as it is really cementing some of the early stage targets around that transformation of the business through both the digitalization of internal processes and driving greater efficiency to our workforce and how we interact with our trading partners.","And you saw some examples of this come to life a bit in fourth quarter, but we do anticipate that the impact will continue to grow throughout 2020 and we do intend to achieve portions of this $100 million in savings this year. For the enterprise, we don't intend to amend or adjust our long-term growth targets that have been previously shared based upon the announcement of this initiative.","Robert Houghton","The next question is for Bob and it\u2019s from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. As it become more challenging to grow market share in a down freight market compared to prior cycles, and what has structurally changed? Will the level of margin compression in January persist in the first half of 2020?","Robert Biesterfeld","So as you know, our truckload volume was down about 1.5% on a year-over-year basis for the full-year of 2019, and we didn't finish the fourth quarter at a flat growth rate. While we were expecting to grow volume over the course of the past year, we did find it challenging to do so. We feel good about the fact that we outperformed the broader Cass Freight Volume Index in each of those quarters however.","Structurally, I think that the biggest change in 2019 was really due to the rapid changes in the markets that preceded 2019. And if I put myself in the seat of our shipper customers, they went from managing failing routing guides that increased costs throughout the end of 2017 through most of 2018, where routing guide depth of tender was averaging two or more.","And then they encountered a rapidly declining cost environment where routing guides were operating almost flawlessly with high 90% acceptance rates at lower costs than they\u2019d experienced the year before. So there really wasn't a lot of motivations for shippers to diverge from their plans in 2019 and given that the spot market was really minimal, it was difficult to take share throughout the course of the year if you missed on the initial contractual bids.","Now that we're deeper into the 2020 annual bid season, we feel really good about the award levels that we're receiving from our contractual customers. And I think that our initial volume growth in January is a good start to the year and it's a testament to our ability to effectively grow volume and take share.","In terms of the margin compression, we know that we've got comparables in the first half of the year that are higher than our current run rate of net revenue per load and are above our historical averages. So we anticipate a headwind as we had through the first half of the year, but it will ease as the year progresses.","Robert Houghton","The next question is from several analysts. Mike, please discuss the cadence of the three-year $100 million cost reduction initiative? How much of this will be realized in 2020? And please provide some context as to what line items you would expect the cost savings to show up in?","Michael Zechmeister","With our enterprise focused on growth and cost savings over the next three years, we have dedicated resources going after a variety of specific projects focused on growth, improving customer experience, and gaining efficiency on the business. The cost savings portion is $100 million of reduction by the end of 2022. The majority of that benefit will come to NAST and be realized through projects designed to enhance efficiency, including targeted automation. We'd expect about a third of that $100 million benefit to be realized in 2020.","Robert Houghton","The next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Ken Hoexter with Bank of America asked a similar question. Bob, the 18% decline in net revenue per day in January, relative to 6% volume growth, it seems to indicate a significant reduction in pricing power in the core brokerage business. Is this the case? And what can be done to reverse a material decline in net revenue?","Robert Biesterfeld","I don't really think that the net revenue per day or more accurately net revenue per load indicates really anything relative to pricing power. I mean, our net revenue on a per load basis is really a derivative of how we sell and what we're able to capture in the marketplace from our customers and how we purchase transportation. As we have said, we serve a really highly fragmented and a highly cyclical market and while we're the largest in the industry, we still only touched less than 3% of the overall For Hire marketplace.","I look across the landscape and see 250,000 motor carriers and over a million trucks on the road, over 15,000 brokers and literally millions of shippers in the addressable market, no one party has the power to control the market pricing dynamics. If we look at that cost side of things and we compare our cost of purchase transportation and where that falls related to some of the benchmarks that we look at, we index really consistently over time. And as I said, our net revenue on a per mile basis is consistent with the past points in time with similar market conditions.","Robert Houghton","The next question for Bob is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please contrast the level of technology investments expected in 2020 versus 2019? And how they may impact NAST operating efficiency and headcount?","Robert Biesterfeld","The technology investments in 2020 are really going to be at similar levels as to what we saw in 2019 for the enterprise without any real meaningful adjustments up or down by business unit. I think the \u2013 one of the positive things that I would say is that, since we launched this increased investment in technology, I would expect that the value creation from those dollars begins to accelerate. So while the investment dollars maybe the same on a year-on-year basis, the output of that investment should continue to increase and compound as we go through 2020 and beyond.","As we continue to release new features and functionality that bring new capabilities to life both internally and for our customers and our carriers. The benefits of these technology improvements and investments coupled with the work that's happening around the network to really re-engineer workflows and continue to transform the actual footprint of the network will add additional capacity and productivity to our team with the NAST and will allow our people to be more productive.","I think that my messaging around this topic has been pretty consistent over the past couple of years and I still think that the most obvious proof point is the further decoupling of headcount and volume and we anticipate delivering really meaningful results against this over the course of 2020.","Robert Houghton","The next question is from Jack Atkins with Stephens for Mike. Given the strength of your balance sheet and cash flows, could you look to get more aggressive with your capital allocation strategy in 2020? Would you look to increase your 90% of net income targeted for shareholder returns going forward?","Michael Zechmeister","We're always looking to deploy our capital in ways that maximize shareholder value through investments with high risk adjusted returns. That's the case for acquisitions or investments in our business, which is our technology investments. The Prime acquisition is a great example.","As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do not expect the Prime acquisition to have a meaningful impact on share purchases, which is to say that the $225 million purchase price will effectively increase our net debt.","We will also continue to reward shareholders through buybacks and dividends. In the fourth quarter, we returned to 138% of net income to shareholders and 104% for the full-year in 2019. As we indicated with nearly 10 million shares still outstanding on our share repurchase authorization, we have the capacity to continue to opportunistically repurchase shares to enhance shareholder value.","Robert Houghton","Our next question is for Bob from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. It competition significantly affect margins and volumes and trucking during the quarter and in January? If so, was it widespread or lane or customer specific?","Robert Biesterfeld","Okay. So let's break that into two pieces of margin and volume. In terms of margins, I would characterize the impacts to our margins in the fourth quarter to be almost entirely cyclical. Relative to volumes in the quarter and frankly for the full-year, there's no doubt that in some of our customer accounts we saw volume declines on a year-over-year basis from 2018 to 2019.","And it was clear that in some of those cases there were competitors that aggressively priced business, below where we felt that the actual contractual markets existed. We look at this based on our understanding of the cost of purchase transportation across the overall market.","In terms of January specifically, I think the fact that our volumes are up 6% so far in the quarter is related to the fact that as I've said before in this industry, contracts reset annually across most customers. Networks change for shippers, networks change for carriers and as we've seen, pricing dynamics certainly shift as well on a year-over-year basis and it's really for this reason that we don't believe in the idea of chasing freight, right.","We don't believe in chasing freight to the bottom of the market as inevitably, prices reset annually and the award levels change and freight is distributed to those providers that give the best in most comprehensive service, those that provide highest quality and those that have the pricing that reflects the marketplace.","Robert Houghton","The next question is for Bob, and comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc. Please discuss your view on normalized net operating margins for NAST? The 33.4% in the quarter was the lowest since you have reclassified your segments. While not looking for guidance, what do you view as a normalized margin range for this segment and over what timeframe is realistic to think about achieving normalized margins?","Robert Biesterfeld","Okay. So our fourth quarter result is, as I said, in NAST, do not reflect our performance expectations going forward. And they're clearly on the low end of the historical benchmarks. We're committed to our investments in technology though. Even in these challenging periods in the freight cycle, certainly in the case of the fourth quarter, technology investments had a negative impact on our operating margins, which drove them towards the lower end of our historical averages.","We believe in these continued investments in tech and the purchase services that we're leveraging in order to accelerate our growth and cost savings. We believe that these investments are going to set us up for a much more successful long-term that bring those operating margins up over time as we move through the year and into 2021. So as we move through the year, we expect operating margins are going to improve. We'll take it from there.","Robert Houghton","Our next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Bob, please discuss competitive pricing dynamics in the market and are the new entrants placing undue pressure on prices they rollout geographically?","Robert Biesterfeld","Thanks, Jordan. Again, we serve this incredibly fragmented market and it's really difficult to get a clean answer on this one, but I'll do my best based on the information that I have on some of the examples that I'll try to cite.","As an example, when we go into an annual truckload bid for a large shipper, as we do many times throughout the year, it's where we get visibility to about a $100 billion in freight on an annual basis. We might go into this bid competing with 60, 70, 80, maybe more carriers in 3PLs that are invited to participate in the bid.","We approach every one of these contractual bids with the customer's needs in mind first and foremost, and not necessarily what we think the competition's pricing strategy is going to be. We take these bids and these opportunities to serve these customers and we examine the characteristics of the customer's freight.","We look at the service expectations that they have. We understand the seasonality of their demand. We look at the industries that they serve as well as our freight densities in and out of the markets that the customer is served along with several other variables.","From there we apply our data. We apply our process. Our knowledge of the customer and the industry that they serve along with our forecast and where we think the markets and these lanes are going to move in terms of pricing. We then align that against our capacity plan for the customer as well as our expected profitability over the life of the contracts.","And from there we boil that out all down and we'd put a service and a price proposal in front of the customer and submit that to them. We go through that process again and again and again throughout the course of the year and given all of the variables that are in play, all of the participants that are each \u2013 in each one of these pricing events, it's really difficult to see any one party emerging in the supply chain that's changing pricing dynamics.","As I said, we see close to $100 billion of truckload freight every year and even with all that data and the insights that we garner from that, there just isn't any real correlation that can be drawn to a broad base disruption to pricing in our industry.","Robert Houghton","Todd Fowler with KeyBanc asked about our acquisition of Prime Distribution Services. Scott Group with Wolfe Research and Fadi Chamoun with Bank of Montreal asked a similar question. Mike, please discuss the strategic rationale behind Prime Distribution? Is there any revenue overlap? What is the historical growth rate for this business and what do you expect it to grow at in 2020?","Michael Zechmeister","Thanks. Consolidation has been a successful value-added service within our LTL business at Robinson for more than a decade. We currently have a network of over 2.9 million square feet of warehousing across the U.S. to service our consolidations business. Strategically, this business is important, as many of our customers value our ability to provide consolidation and related services.","Upon closing the Prime acquisition, we will add scale by adding 2.6 million square feet to our network of consolidation warehouses. We will also benefit from fulfillment and distribution services as well as lane density within our truckload and LTL business.","To be clear, our non-asset based business model is not changing. We're also not entering into the contract logistics business. We believe the combination of our consolidation business with Prime as solid growth potential. Our businesses are complimentary and we're excited about the opportunity to make each other better as we move forward together.","Robert Houghton","Jordan Alger with Goldman Sachs asked about truckload capacity. Bob, are you seeing any changes to truck capacity now? In other words, is there any initial signs of tighter markets?","Robert Biesterfeld","Beyond the publicly available data that we all are looking at, we watch our rate of new carrier signups, which as we said, trended down meaningfully both sequentially and in a year-over-year basis. Related to market tightness, the second half of January, the late part of December and early January. It did represent some tighter markets than we've seen in a few quarters. But as we've gone through January, we've really seen the market settle as the month has progressed.","Robert Houghton","The next question is for Bob and comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc; Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company; and Jack Atkins with Stephens asked a similar question. What are your expectations for NAST headcount in 2020? Have you reached a point where headcount can decline while volumes increase for a sustainable period?","Robert Biesterfeld","We've made a lot of progress in our NAST business in terms of re-engineering and rethinking about how that business operates moving forward. And because of that, we do feel that we can grow volume in a meaningful way without needing to add additional headcount.","Our focus is less on driving headcount declines as it is about widening that productivity gap between the change in headcount and the change in volume as we continue to layer in additional digitalized and automated processes for our customers, carriers and our employees.","Robert Houghton","Our next question for Bob is from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird; Tom Wadewitz with UBS; and Allison Landry with Credit Suisse asked a similar question. Please discuss any expectations for contract truckload pricing growth during 2020s bid season. Is flat year-over-year growth on an aggregate basis realistic or does the magnitude of pressure in Q4 of 2019, speak to the likelihood of declines and contractual rates during the first half of 2020?","Robert Biesterfeld","If you look at the chart that we've provided in the earnings deck and the investor deck over the past few years of really tracking the change in rate and cost over the past several years, you do see that inflection where it starts to you know trend up over the past or decline last over the past couple of quarters. So fourth quarter wasn't the bottom of the cycle. I think we certainly must be close to that.","Obviously different customers are going to experience the market differently in 2020 in terms of either increases or decreases to their freight spend depending on the characteristics of the customer, the behavior of the customer and where their pricing was set in 2019. But in a very general statement, we think that the contractual market in 2020 will be somewhat flattish to up a couple of points by the time of the year fully plays out.","Robert Houghton","The next question is for Mike from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan asked a similar question. You indicated that personnel expenses decreased in the quarter due to declines in incentive compensation. To what degree were lower incentive compensation expense as a tailwind in the fourth quarter and what is your expectation for incentive compensation accruals in 2020 versus 2019?","Michael Zechmeister","Yes. Reduced incentive compensation from bonus to equity to commissions drove the $40 million year-over-year reduction in personnel expense in Q4. For incentive compensation, each quarter, we do a year-to-date true-up of our estimated incentive expense. Given the decline in performance in Q4 a much greater reduction to the incentive compensation expense was needed in Q4 to arrive at the proper expense for the full-year performance in 2019. Given the extent of that incentive compensation reduction in Q4, our annual personnel expense for 2019 is a better indicator of our annual personnel expense expectations for 2020 than simply using the Q4 run rate.","Robert Houghton","The next question for Bob comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. What is C.H. Robinson strategy for winning new business with smaller shipping customers?","Robert Biesterfeld","So infrequent shippers and small businesses are a huge part of our focus. So they make up, really a majority of our customer count. I think we've said it obviously before, but our top 500 customers make up about half of our revenue. Our top 2,000 customers make up about 80%, but we've got this long tail of small businesses and infrequent shippers that make up the majority of our customer count. So that's really one of the reasons why we made the Freightquote acquisition initially in 2015 and then relaunched the Freightquote by C.H. Robinson new product earlier last year to serve these small businesses directly.","As we work on building and launching that process, we spent a lot of time in the field with small businesses, trying to really understand what was at the core of what they needed. And what we found was that for many of these customers, what they really need and want is a super intuitive and simple platform that allows them to move multiple modes of transportation with a \u2013 really with a click of a button and a swipe of a credit card. And so we delivered that to them in the Freightquote by C.H. Robinson platform.","What we also learned, though, is that for other companies, even though their businesses maybe small, their needs were fairly complex, they needed more comprehensive services, global services or consulting support, so we've got an account management team built to serve these small businesses with more complex needs.","For other small businesses, we heard that what they \u2013 maybe they were a bit more advanced in their own carrier management relationships, and what they needed was a low-cost yet highly functional TMS system.","So in those cases, we've got our freight viewed TMS product that we're able to implement for those businesses. So I can keep going for a while here talking about how we serve small businesses in creative and innovative ways. But the punch line, I think is really that just like with our larger customers, we leverage our data advantage, our expertise and our technology to deliver solutions that are really tailored to the needs of these small businesses and we meet them how and where they want to interact with us versus forcing them to a single option for a platform.","Robert Houghton","The next question is for Bob from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc. Please discuss Robinson Incubator Labs. What role do you see this playing in your organization? What if any is the financial impact?","Robert Biesterfeld","So first off, Robinson Labs is another example of where our increased technology investment is really intersecting with our customers and creating value in new ways. While we formally launched this last week, we've been in the building stage here for a couple of years and we're really excited about the output of this team.","Robinson Labs, in its essence is an innovation incubator, where the next big idea is in logistics and supply chain are created, tested and scaled to drive smarter solutions for Robinson\u2019s customers and carriers.","Through Robinson Labs, our logistics experts, our innovation teams, our data scientists are all able to collaborate with customers and carriers to create really personalized solutions for shippers' challenges. From there the Robinson Labs team is able to work hand-in-hand with our enterprise technology team, which consists, as we've talked about with more than a thousand data scientists and engineers and developers and take those solutions once proven and scale them across the Robinson network in Navisphere, which benefits our entire platform and all of our connected customers and carriers. ","In terms of financial impact, we're in the early stages today, but I can say that with certainty, I've engaged with a lot of our customers that have been part of the Robinson Labs sandbox. And they've shared with me directly that they find this experience to be a differentiator for us in the market, and that it will ultimately help lead us to earning more business from these customers as we continue to focus on customer-led innovation. Several of the projects that have originated in Robinson Labs since its founding have already been scaled across many of our enterprise customers and our enterprise systems.","Robert Houghton","The next question is for Mike from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc. The decline in income from operations in the All Other and Corporate segment accelerated in the quarter and for the year. Are there any unusual costs in the quarter and how should we think about that line into 2020? Is it going to incur a greater loss to support technology initiatives?","Michael Zechmeister","Thanks for the question, Todd. The Q4 loss of $8.8 million in income from operations from the All Other and Corporate Results segment was driven by increased expense associated with commercial off-the-shelf software, which included projects to improve our performance in HR, sales and accounting as well as additional IT headcount.","We have a practice of carrying expense associated with the installation of commercial off-the-shelf software in our All Other and Corporate segment in the first year. In Q4 and the full-year 2019, this expense more than offset the profitability of the businesses in that segment or the business segments in there \u2013 in that line item, and it caused an overall loss.","In 2020 these software expenses will be allocated out to the businesses. And as a result, in 2020, we expect income from operations in the All Other and Corporate Results segment to be positive again for the year.","Robert Houghton","Our next question for Bob comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Headcount declined while truckload volume was flat in NAST. However, net revenue per head still declined sequentially. How will you evaluate if the significant levels of investment are improving productivity and generating the expected return on investment? Will you share additional KPIs to provide more transparency in the future?","Robert Biesterfeld","Thanks, Brian. So I'd attribute the sequential decline in net revenue per head almost entirely to the sequential decline in net revenue per truckload. That sequential margin compression from Q3 to Q4 negatively impacted sequential revenue by over $30 million. So it\u2019s meaningful.","And we have several metrics that we're tracking internally today to evaluate the impact of investment against productivity and return. Many of these metrics are volume and activity-based and tied to automation around particular parts of the business or steps and processes, which ultimately will drive productivity gains across the network.","Again, I go back and I say I think that the relationship between the headcount and volume is a really good marker for progress here as many of the other measures that we're looking at, at a lower grain all ladder up to that measure. The achievement of the cost savings target that we identified over $100 million that we talked about earlier is also a part of the total return on this investment. So to your question on, do we intend to be more transparent? Share more KPIs? The answer to that is, yes. And as the year progresses, we do intend to peel back of it and show a few more KPIs related to that transformation.","Robert Houghton","Our next question for Mike comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Any other opportunistic acquisitions on the horizon?","Michael Zechmeister","Thanks Jason. As has been our history, we continue to see M&A as a lever to help us expand our geographic presence, add or improve services, build scale and enhance our technology platform. We prefer strong businesses with compelling strategic benefits, good cultural fit and a proven non-asset-based business models. Specific to your question on opportunistic acquisitions on the horizon, we maintain a solid pipeline of opportunities and we will remain disciplined around value creation and strategic fit.","Robert Houghton","Our next question for Bob comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. What impact, if any, are you assuming the regulatory environment and trucking has on capacity in 2020? Has there been any appreciable change in capacity with the drug and alcohol database coming online in the final phase of the ELD mandate?","Robert Biesterfeld","We've not yet seen any meaningful impacts to capacity that we could directly tie to the drug and alcohol clearinghouse coming online or the final phase of the ELD mandate. Given all the other variables impacting the balance of supply and demand, we're not forecasting a meaningful change in capacity in 2020 tied directly to our regulations.","Robert Houghton","Our final question is from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Bob, we've heard that the new entrance, while still more aggressive than the legacy brokers are starting to be less aggressive. Are you seeing this too?","Robert Biesterfeld","Anything I would share here would be secondhand information, so I'm not going to necessarily comment about what we hear about other companies and their pricing strategies. I'd reinforce that for the fourth quarter, our win rates on our truckload contract bids doubled when compared to fourth quarter of last year. So we see that as a really positive sign.","When I reflect on where our team is focused, they're hyper focused on running our business. They're focused on building great technology, providing unmatched services to our customers, helping our motor carriers run more profitable and successful businesses, and providing great careers for our people, while ultimately staying focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders.","Robert Houghton","That concludes the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. A replay of today's call will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com at approximately 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached via phone or e-mail. Thank you again for participating in our fourth quarter 2019 conference call. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."],"4310":["C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call February  1, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Timothy Gagnon - Director of Investor Relations","John Wiehoff - Chief Executive Officer","Andrew Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Operator","Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson Fourth Quarter 2016 Conference Call. Following today's presentation, Tim Gagnon will facilitate a review of previously-submitted questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, February 1, 2017.","I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Gagnon, Director of Investor Relations.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everybody. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Clarke, our Chief Financial Officer. John and Andy will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our fourth quarter and we will follow that with a response to the pre-submitted questions we received after earnings yesterday.","Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate the discussion. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Andy will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments.","I'd like to remind you that comments made by John, Andy or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","With that, I'll turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments.","John Wiehoff","Thank you, good morning everyone. Before I discuss the results for the quarter and year-end, I want to take a minute and talk about some information that we\u2019re presenting this quarter end will be going forward. You may have noticed in our release yesterday afternoon that we began presenting our business in three reporting segments in addition to the traditional reporting that we\u2019ve provided.","Our decision to add segment reporting is largely based on the accumulation of changes that have occurred in recent years. We\u2019ve invested to expand our services and diversify our business and have also made structural changes to align executive oversight to the business. In late 2016, we made changes to our internal financial information that we used to make decisions including the allocation of our shared cost to the key business segments.","Our three reportable segments are the surface transportation business in North America, where we\u2019re market leader in providing truckload, less than truckload and intermodal services. The global porting business which now represents over 20% of our enterprise net revenues after the recent acquisition of APC and the Robinson Fresh business were an addition to transportation and logistics services, we provide fresh products for our customers. Our additional business units are aggregated into All Other.","These business segments provide specialized services and we remain focused on assuring that we provide our full portfolio of services to our customers. The visions were collaboratively to assure that we present a single quality experience focused on improving outcomes and delivering exceptional value to our customers. These changes are helping us to drive more efficient business processes and to better understand the returns on our capital allocations as we continue to diversify.","Overall, it\u2019s been a very busy month for our finance team and they did a great job of executing the year-end closing with the addition of the acquired APC business and segment reporting. So with that let me move on to talk about our results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016.","Total revenues increased 6.4% in the fourth quarter. The revenue increase was the result of volume growth across all of our services as well as the fact that fuel comparisons normalized on a year-over-year basis. Net revenues declined 1.6% in the quarter and this is primarily the result of lower truckload margins when compared to a very strong fourth quarter in 2015.","The fourth quarter truckload activity was consistent with what we experienced in Q3 and discussed on our last call, with good volume increases offset by margin compression. Outside of North American truckload, we achieved solid net revenue growth of 14%. APC contributed approximately 2% to the overall net revenues of the company in the fourth quarter. The integration of APC is off to a good start and we\u2019ll talk about this later.","Income from operations was 195 million, a decrease of 9% and net income was down 3%. We had diluted earnings per share of $0.86, compared to $0.88 last year for the quarter. We finished the full year with EPS of $3.59, a 2.3% increase over 2015.","Our average headcount was up 7% or approximately 4.5% organically. We continue to believe that the strength and experience of our team is a competitive advantage. The additional segment information includes employees by segment that will help you better understand how we\u2019re evolving our teams and where we are investing. We\u2019ve made progress on a number of efficiency metrics across our company and we believe we can continue to leverage technology and process improvements so our employees can continue to focus on creating value for our customers.","I would sum up my comments on 2016 by saying that we achieved many of our growth goals and made some good progress on our long-term plans. Truckload margin compression was a challenge to our earnings growth in the second half, but our service metrics remain good and we\u2019ll adjust our pricing to the market going forward as we always have.","With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Andy for some more prepared comments.","Andrew Clarke","Thank you, John and good morning as well and thank you all for joining us on this call. As you\u2019ll notice we\u2019ve rearranged the slides in the deck to present a cleaner flow of results from the enterprise level to the reportable segments. For comparison purposes we have a few slides holdover slides to confirm the way we previously discussed results.","I\u2019ll briefly cover these to allow ample time for discussion of the segments. And finally before diving into the numbers, I\u2019d like to recognize all of our people for their great efforts in delivering these results; while not perfect they reflect solid performance in a challenging environment. Thank you, all.","On to the summarized income statement, for the fourth quarter operating expenses increased 3% to $367 million. For the year, operating expenses were up slightly, up 2%.","Personnel expenses decreased 3%, primarily driven by lower variable compensation incentives which were partially offset by average headcount growth of 7%. APC added approximately 2.5% to the headcount growth in the period. For the year, personnel expenses increased just over 1%, highlighting strategic investments we\u2019re making in talent as well as the variable nature of our cost structure.","SG&A expenses increased 22% in the fourth quarter, $19.6 million increase over last year. The primary reasons for this increase were higher claims and bad debt reserves. These items accounted for approximately $7.5 million of the increase.","In addition, we had higher cost related to the acquisition of APC Logistics and other M&A activities as well as other items including amortization and that totaled about $8 million. Finally, we had increases in warehousing expenses of $2 million.","Our operating income as a percent of net revenue was 34.5%, a decrease of 310 basis points from last year. For the year that figure was 36.8%. Interest and other expenses decreased approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter.","This was primarily the result of approximately $4 million in currency gains related to the strong US dollar and the fact that we had $7.2 million in indemnification asset write off in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 35.8% versus 37.1% last year.","Moving on to Slide 5 and other financial information, we generated nearly $153 million in cash in the quarter and had just over $20 million in CapEx. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $529 million and year-to-date capital expenditures were approximately $91 million, reflecting the completion of our second data center and increased technology spending.","We finished the quarter with $248 million in cash and our debt balance is $1.24 billion. For 2017, we expect capital expenditure to return to a range of $60 million to $70 million.","On to Slide 6 and our capital distribution to shareholders, we returned approximately $455 million to shareholders in 2016, with approximately 245 million in dividends and approximately 210 million in share repurchases. For whole of 2016 we returned 89% of our net income to shareholders, which is in line with our stated objectives.","Slides 7, 8 and 9 will serve as transition slides for the call as they reflect the manner in which we traditionally discussed our results. I\u2019ll spend less time on slides 7 and 9 to allow more time for discussion of the segments. Going forward in 2017, some of these perspectives and slides may be removed or in the appendix of the earnings deck. Slide 7 represents our net revenue for the various services from an enterprise perspective.","Moving on to Slide 8 and our North American truckload price and cost charge. Slide 8 presents a few key metrics of cost and price for North American truckload. On this graph, the light and dark blue lines represent the present change in North America truckload rate per mile to customers and carriers, net of fuel cost since 2008. The grey line is the net revenue margin for all transportation services.","In this year\u2019s fourth quarter, the North America truckload rate per mile fell 3.5% versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter, while the cost per mile was flat. The 3.5% spread between the cost and price was the largest we\u2019ve seen in several years and was primarily the result of the fact that the cost of capacity was moving up, while close to 65% of our customer pricing is committed through our customer contracts.","During the fourth quarter the monthly percentage change in cost per mile to carriers trended up sequentially due to the seasonality around peak in year-end. We\u2019ve discussed through the back half of 2016 that our commitments to lower price freight opportunity would likely bring lower margins when compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","In that period last year, the cost of capacity was falling at a faster pace than customer pricing. We\u2019re familiar with this type cyclicality and are confident that our network is executing well. We continue to take share and are adjusting transactional pricing as appropriate. As many of you know in the first two quarters of the year, we\u2019re quite busy responding to customer bids. We do expect carrier cost to continue to rise through the year and if this happens, it will likely lead to rising customer prices when compared to commitments we made in 2016.","Moving on to Slide 9 and our transportation results, transportation total revenues for all segments were up 8.5% to $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter. As John mentioned, this is a result of strong volume growth of 9.4% across all of our services in the quarter. Transportation net revenue margin decreased approximately 180 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter to 17.2%.","We\u2019ve been highlighting fuel prices over the past six or so quarters when discussing net revenue margin as fuel has had a significant cosmetic impact here. Versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we estimate that fuel had an approximate 110 basis point impact on net revenue margin. The primary reason for the remaining margin compression was due to the results in our North American truckload business. I\u2019ll provide some details on that in a moment.","As we transition to Slide 10 and the start of the discussion of our results by reportable segments, it is important to understand that the overhead cost associated with our technology investments and other shared services teams are allocated into each of the business segments.","We refer to our North American transportation division as NAST. The NAST business is comprised of offices in the United States, Mexico and Canada, providing primarily truckload, less than truckload and intermodal services to our customers. NAST total revenues were 2.3 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 5% over last year\u2019s period.","Net revenues decreased 8.8% to $363 million in the quarter. For the year, NAST revenues decreased slightly at 2.6%. Net revenue margin was 15.9% compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter of 18.3%. The lower margins were primarily the result of margin compression and the fact that fuel prices normalized on a year-over-year basis in the period. For the year, NAST revenue margins were flat at 17.4%. I\u2019d like to call out again the NAST team for performance in 2016 on delivering these strong results.","NAST income from operations was down 14.3% to $158 million. NAST operating margin was 43.4% in the quarter and finished 2016 at just over 44%. Employee count was 6,809, up just under 2%.","Now on to Slide 11 and the service line results within NAST, John and I have both highlighted some of the factors impacting our truckload business in the quarter. NAST truckload net revenues were down $39 million or 12.9%. NAST contributes approximately 92% of North American truckload net revenues for the company. Volume was up 10% in the quarter and this was a result of growth in both our contractual and transactional shipments.","We believe that taking market share in a challenging part of the cycle is important to our ability to grow our business over the long-term. The NAST team did a great job delivering strong volume growth while adding minimal new headcount to execute this business. We had 3,400 new carriers in the fourth quarter compared to approximately 2,700 in last year\u2019s period. These new carriers moved approximately 15,000 shipments for us in the quarter.","The LTL business had another solid quarter growing net revenues over 5% to nearly $91 million. Volumes increased 5% when compared to the fourth quarter last year, pricing was up slightly and net revenue margins were down slightly in the quarter. Volume growth was the driver of the net revenue growth in both the quarter and for the full year of 2016. The combination of our legacy LTL business and the Freightquote ecommerce platform are helping us reach all types of customers.","Intermodal net revenues decreased 15.8% in the quarter. However, volumes were up 10%. The margin compression of the quarter is consistent with the trend we have been highlighting throughout 2016 as we've been winning more often with our large customers and the contractual business, which comes of lower margins.","Moving on to our Global Forwarding segment results on Slide 12, I'd like to start my comments, as John did, with congratulating the Global Forwarding team for these strong results. Our people have done a tremendous job of integrating the APC acquisition without taking their eye off the organic growth ball.","We'd also like to welcome our new colleagues in Australia and New Zealand to the Robinson team. It's great to have you on board and thank you for the contribution to our success. Total revenues for the Global Forwarding segment in the fourth quarter were $476 million, up 26.3% versus last year.","Fourth quarter net revenues were $114 million, 27.5% increase from 2015. APC Logistics contributed approximately 14.7% of the total growth. Net revenue margin was 24%, up 20 basis points over last year. Income from operations was just shy of $26 million, up 37% in the fourth quarter.","Operating margin was 21.6% in the quarter and 20.4% for the full year of 2016. Headcount increased 14% in the quarter with APC representing just over 300 or approximately 9% of the additional employees in the business. We continue to realize the benefits of the global portfolio of services as our cross-selling activities are yielding positive results to the entire Robinson organization.","Next we'll discuss the Global Forwarding service lines on Slide 13. Ocean net revenues were up 23.7% and APC contributed approximately 12% to the growth. Ocean shipments increased approximately 23% in the quarter and pricing continued to be down in the ocean service line. This was a nice bounce back quarter for the ocean business as the team did a great job of managing through the hand gen [ph] disruption.","Air net revenues increased 32.3% with APC contributing approximately 10% to that growth figure. Air shipments increased approximately 35% in the quarter and pricing was again down double digits. Growing the air freight business has been a strategic initiative throughout the year and the Global Forwarding team finished the year with over 20% air freight shipment growth. Congratulations.","Customs net revenue increased 48.5% with APC contributing approximately 40% of the growth. Customs transactions increased approximately 31% in the fourth quarter.","Transitioning to our Robinson Fresh business on Slide 14, the Robinson Fresh segment includes revenues from both the product sourcing sales and services, as well as transportation services provided through Robinson Fresh customers.","Robinson Fresh total revenues were $530 million, a decrease of 3.7% in the fourth quarter. Net revenues were $52 million, down 7.9% from last year. For the year, Robinson Fresh net revenues were essentially flat. Robinson Fresh operating expenses decreased 3.3% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to decreases in personnel expenses and partially offset by an increase in warehouse expenses related to expanding facilities.","Income from operations was $13 million, a decrease of 19% versus last year. And Robison Fresh headcount increased 4.3% in the quarter. Robinson Fresh sourcing total revenues declined 11.5%. The decline in total revenues was primarily the result of lower market pricing on some key commodities. Net revenues decreased 3.5% in the fourth quarter as a result of the lower net revenue per case and partially offset by a 2% growth in case volume.","Slide 16, Robinson Fresh transportation net revenues decreased 11.9% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to decreases in truckload net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by increases and other transportation services net revenues. Robinson Fresh transportation net revenue margin decreased in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 due primarily to lower customer pricing.","And finally I'd like to highlight the information that makes up All Other and Corporate on Slide 17. All Other includes our managed services business, as well as surface transportation outside of North America and other miscellaneous revenues, as well as unallocated corporate expenses. Headcount was up 12.9% primarily the result of increases in our shared services team, including technology, other enterprise resources, and managed services.","You will notice an operating loss in both the 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters. This is the result of unallocated corporate expenses of approximately $5 million in this year's fourth quarter. Both the managed services and European service transportation business are performing well and are profitable.","Slide 18, net revenues for the other category increased 24.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 led by the continued strong performance in our managed services and other service transportation business in Europe. Managed services net revenue increased 32.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $17.7 million. This was the result of growth for both new and existing customers.","The TMC and managed services teams are consistently outperforming the market and delivering strong results for us and great value for our customers. Other surface transportation increased 8.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $14.7 million. Our European service transportation team continues to perform well and has done a great job of growing the business despite a challenging economic backdrop.","Thank you all on the Robinson team for another great quarter. We appreciate your hard work and dedication. Thank you all as well for listening in today.","With that, I will now turn it back to John to make some closing comments before we answer some of your questions.","John Wiehoff","Thanks, Andy. Before we move to the questions, I'll take just a couple of minutes to wrap things up and address the topics on Slide 19.","In January to date, our total company net revenue has decreased approximately 1% per business day. This includes the additional revenue from the APC acquisition. Obviously, it's very early in the year and the quarter, but so far we have seen a continuation of good volume growth offset by truckload margin compression.","We know that we will continue to have challenging comparisons on truckload margins for the first half of 2017 and we also expect meaningful bid in pricing activity in the months ahead. We\u2019ve managed through these cycles before and we're confident the network will do a good job adapting to the market conditions.","Our North American truckload volumes continue to be strong with about 12% shipment per business day growth thus far in January. In the Global Forwarding segment, we are deep into the APC integration and things are going well. Customer and employee retention has been excellent. Our primary focus for 2017 will be integrating the APC offices into the Navisphere platform.","And lastly a few comments on our 2017 investment priorities. Starting with growing market share across all of our services, market share gains were 2016 highlight and we believe we can continue to grow and gain share in all of our services. The foundation of this is a relentless focus on having great people who are dedicated to selling and managing accounts that will always be a primary focus for us.","We're going to continue to invest in technology. At the core of that is our Navisphere platform that is a common platform for all of our segments and services. The themes around technology will include enhancements in supply chain visibility, as well as gathering more and more analytical data that we can use for our own benefit, as well as our customers and lastly improving and automating our processes along our digital strategies to make sure that we're transforming our networks and staying current in the marketplace.","Lastly with regards to global expansion while we're proud of the coverage that we have, the APC acquisition shows that there are areas of the world where we can continue to expand our network into different geographies, particularly other regions of Asia and Europe where we believe we have ongoing opportunity to enhance our network and continue to expand around the globe.","So, that concludes our prepared comments for the quarter and with that I will turn it back to the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Mr. Gagnon, the floor is yours for the question-and-answer Session.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Danna and let me take a moment to thank shareholders and analysts to send in their questions last evening, some great questions, and we'll get to as many of those as we can this morning. Just as a reminder, I\u2019ll frame up the questions as they were submitted and turn it over to John and Andy for a response and we'll get right into that now.","The first question is for Andy. While bad debt was up in the fourth quarter, bad debt was well below normal in 2016, should we expect to see the bad debt accrual move to a more normal level in 2017?","Andrew Clarke","Yeah, we had really good claims experience as it relates to bad debt in all of 2016, which really reflects two things, one, the quality of our customer base and, two, the timeliness with which they pay. The accrual itself is a formula, which takes into consideration those two factors, one, the quality of the customers and the buckets with which they pay. So, we feel really good about the process. We feel really good about the quality of the customer base and don't expect any material changes to that accrual. Obviously, things change as the market develops. But from where we sit right now, we feel good about our accrual.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John, what are your thoughts on acquisitions, industry, and geography and how much capital do you feel comfortable deploying toward the acquisitions?","John Wiehoff","One of a lot of reasons why we wanted to evolve our financial information into the segment reporting is because it is reflective of how today we're thinking about our capital allocation and that includes M&A exploration. So, all of our operating divisions that Andy went through, North America surface transportation, Global Forwarding, Robinson Fresh, as well as European service transportation and managed services, those are all operating divisions that we have plans to explore M&A opportunities and are open to capital allocation into each of them.","These have a little bit different unique theme. We're a market share leader in North America surface transportation. The types of acquisitions that - we look at might be a little bit differently. Freightquote was our most recent acquisition where that went after a segment of or a portion of the customer base that we didn't feel like we were penetrating as aggressively as we wanted to.","Global Forwarding we've talked a lot about the Phoenix and APC acquisitions in the last four years and really strengthening the build out of that network and investing in geographies that we weren't previously invested into. So, we're committed to all of those divisions, as well as from an enterprise view thinking about what other services or supply chain activities that we might get involved in that would create yet another division or opportunity to grow.","And so we're looking in all those areas and customizing kind of the capital allocation and the thinking to the specific parts of the business. In terms of how much capital would we deploy, Andy has kind of laid this out in the past, but over the last four years through those three larger acquisitions, we've maintained that capital distribution policy of dividends and share repurchases around 90%.","Those acquisitions have been funded by moving from around $0.5 billion of cash to somewhere around a billion of debt over the last four years. We've also stated and remain comfortable that we could take on another billion or two of debt depending upon what it is that we're acquiring and where we go. So, we do have some more opportunity to deploy capital there as well.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John and next questions for Andy really building on that topic. Will anything change concerning CHRW\u2019s preference for capital return in organic growth or debt repayment in the New Year?","Andrew Clarke","Just to follow up on John's comments, clearly if you think about the order of preference, first it's reinvesting in the business. Last year 2016 was one of our bigger years in terms of capital expenditures just over $90 million and a lot of that went towards technology. So, if you think about where we have been and will continue to make investments in the business to benefit the beauty of being non-asset based is you're investing in areas around technology and people in process improvement, which generate pretty significant returns. So, we have been and we\u2019ll continue to invest in those areas.","John spent a lot of time and we've spent a lot of time thinking about acquisitions and how do we supplement the growth of our organization, Phoenix, Freightquote, APC have all been very both accretive, as well as high returns on the capital that we've committed and we\u2019ll continue to look at that such another great way for us to enhance the growth of the organization and going to that segment reporting, it certainly delineates where we generate the returns and where we can continue to make investments.","We think about our current capital structure and how much we are comfortable with returning to shareholders, we're very comfortable with returning the 90% of the share repurchases, as well as dividends and we don't foresee that changing. And then finally as it relates to our debt structure, we have a very comfortable leverage ratio right now. And with our short term rates just hovering below 2% on the debt, we don't foresee a rush to repay that anytime soon.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. And the next question for John on net revenue. Can you provide year-over-year net revenue by month in the fourth quarter?","John Wiehoff","Yeah, so we've provided these numbers before. And in the fourth quarter of 2016, month by month, October down 4%. November and December were closer to flat. When we've talked about these before, I want to throw the same caveat out there again to that. We do the best that we can to scrub those numbers per business day and that's what it would yield for the fourth quarter. As anybody in the industry knows, there is quite a bit of variance by day of the week. And when the holidays fall on different days of the week, especially in the end of the year around Thanksgiving and Christmas, you can get some pretty meaningful variations on a per day basis around those. So, even though it was down, flat, flat, to be a little bit careful about the trends within the quarter, I would say that our activity was generally fairly consistent across the fourth quarter with maybe a little bit of improvement as the quarter one.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy, what do you expect the tax rate to be in 2017?","Andrew Clarke","As John did, the biggest caveat that I will put out there is, not knowing what's going to happen to the U.S. corporate tax rate, so my comments will be all else equal. We expect our tax rate to be between 36.5% and low 37%, which reflects the investments, the selection and election of APB 23, as well as the fact that there is a growing percentage of our net income that's generated outside of the United States.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John, how is your European truck brokerage business doing under the leadership of your own icing? It appears that you've been hiring some high-powered talent with a lot of local knowledge and experience. Have those hires changed up your playbook in Europe significantly to drive outsized growth or is it that the market suffering or is the market suffering from the same pricing supply demand dynamics currently creating the challenging environment in North America?","John Wiehoff","Andy talked you through the all other category. While both European brokerage business and managed services didn't rise to the materiality of reportable segment, they're both very important growth areas for us just like I talked about and we're committed to growing them. We have added and made some leadership changes to that European truck brokerage division over the last couple of years and we do feel very good about our leadership team and our prospects for sustained growth.","You can see the net revenue that Andy described is growing very nicely. Our truck brokerage business or surface transportation business in Europe is at a much smaller scale and it's far more transactional today than the scale of North America and the committed trade. So, we're not seeing the same degree of margin fluctuation in the European surface transportation business. There was more normalized net revenue growth along with volume growth that was comparable to North America. So, we do feel good about our foundation there and we have pretty aggressive growth goals for organic market penetration, as well as what I mentioned earlier around exploring M&A opportunities.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy, is the 22 million in depreciation and amortization expense in the fourth quarter a good run rate to use going forward?","Andrew Clarke","We had our second datacenter come online in October and as a result - and obviously the increased technology spend that we have, we would expect that number to be between 22 and maybe even just a shade above 23 per quarter for 2017.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. Next to John, can you give us your thoughts on the outlook for the Forwarding business overall? How are margins trending and which trade lanes provide the most opportunity for Robinson?","John Wiehoff","Giving visibility to the Global Forwarding segment and the investments that we've made there over the last couple of years again was one of the things that we believe segment reporting will give you a little bit better insight into. We've been committed in offering Global Forwarding services for a couple of decades, but in the last several years as we've ramped up our scale and have improved some of our operating processes, you can see that we've not only gotten good returns, but we have some pretty good growth momentum in the Global Forwarding division. I\u2019ll remind you that the core of our Global Forwarding business is centered around Asia to North America activities. That's where we have the highest market share. That's where we are a market leader, particularly China to North America where we rank number one in the NVOCC rankings that we've talked about in the past. A lot of our growth initiatives are building on the investments that we've made to expand and strengthen our network in other regions.","So, in terms of the corridors where there are opportunities, we have been for the last several years focusing in on Asia to Europe and really leveraging the platform and the strength that we have in Asia and the carrier relationships to sell more into the Asia to Europe lane. Andy also mentioned the air freight initiative where today we are disproportionate to ocean net revenues. We're building and investing in the competencies around air freight and we're very happy with the market share gains that we had in those corridors this year.","Lastly with the APC investment, we've talked that they have been our agent for a couple of decades. And so, North America to Australia has been a focal point for us for a while. But with this acquisition and having a world-class team in Australia now, it also opens up the opportunity to sell more from Asia and Europe to Australia to work on those trade lanes as well.","Rounding it out, as we strengthen in Europe we'll also be able to focus more on Europe to North America and kind of building out all of the major trade corridors as we grow. So, our investments are in the Global Forwarding division are businesses that we feel very comfortable with and as we gain strength in each of the regions, we\u2019ll just continue to build that global network by putting the pieces together on the Navisphere platform and adding talent and additional offices to grow.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy, there has been quite a bit of press recently that both Amazon and Uber may be looking to compete in both the truck brokerage and forwarding segments with high automation, digital offerings. Can management provide any high level thought of how Robinson's model might differentiate from the competition? And how should we think about the digitization of the brokerage model on net margins in the future?","John Wiehoff","Great question and a lot of ways that we can take those, but I\u2019ll first start off by saying that both of those companies, I think what they're doing is challenging every organization whether you're in transportation or not to fundamentally look at the way in which you connect your customers with your suppliers and the way in which you interact. The good news is we've been doing this for a long time. And I would tell you the even better news is that and I'll speak specifically around Robinson and how we approach it is that we talk about our people, we talk about our process, and we talk about our technology and they're very key and they're very fundamental to the way in which we interact with both our customers and our carriers.","So, for all of 2016 we connected over 110,000 customers with over 71,000 carriers and moving over 18 million shipments across the globe. It\u2019s a very complex network that we've developed and that we perfect and that we go to market with every day and we do that with smart people and we do that with technology and there is a process that you need to go through to make it really effective for everybody involved, because if something goes wrong, which it always does, you have to be smart, you have to be ready to react in that manner.","We\u2019ve spent a lot of time. We've talked a lot about on this call and we talked a lot about it in the past around the investments that we're making, particularly on the technology side and the digitalization or digitization, however people want to phrase that, of connecting the supply chain. So, we do it on a full suite of services, so I\u2019ll go across the spectrum, a full suite of services with our TMC division. I mean they're managing global supply chains. It is global. It is across the globe. It's not moving a truckload from one city to another. It's moving millions of shipments for some of our best customers, some of our biggest customers across the globe and, yeah, we're spending a lot of money in technology to provide visibility and enhancements for our customers, but at the end of the day you still need people to make sure that the job gets done.","And then all the way on the other side in terms of what people would consider to be more transactional, so that that's committed on the transactional side, it's connecting, it's automating, it's - you go into any of our offices today and you'll see a different type and a higher caliber knowledge worker that is in those offices that are doing more value-added services, even on the transactional business that five years ago quite frankly wasn't happening and I would argue that five years from now you're going to continue to see that on a more refined basis.","As it relates to what's going to happen with margins, you can go back and look at our margins over the last 40 quarters, the last 10 years, and you can see a variability within that and throughout we've always had competition. We've had good competition. We've had competition that\u2019s challenged us and - but we've always been able to maintain a certain amount and level of margin in our business. Why? It\u2019s because we had value. We had value to our customers. We had value to their supply chains or helping them be more efficient and more effective and how they serve their customers.","And on the other side of that is we had a tremendous amount of value to our carriers. We allow the 70 some odd 1000 carriers to connect directly into our customers that otherwise had they not gone through us they wouldn't be able to effectively serve them. And again at the core of that is our people and at the core of that is our technology and the connect points that we have are quite frankly unparalleled and without going into the specifics of the other companies that were mentioned in the question, yes, they have technology as well. Yes, they have that, but I would say that our people is what really differentiates us in that marketplace and I think our customers respect and understand that and quite frankly I know that our carriers do as well.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John, what level of contract mix do you plan to run in 2017 for the North America truckload business?","John Wiehoff","One of the longer term trends that we've talked often about is that the mix of business in North America truckload has over time been moving more towards committed or awarded trade or sometimes referred to as contract freight. Over a long period of time, if you go back a couple of decades, we were almost entirely transactional in that North American truckload freight. And Andy mentioned earlier that at times now and in 2016, we would estimate somewhere 60%, 65% so more than half of our freight is committed or awarded in some form or fashion.","So, that shows the trend of - as we've grown and taken on scale that we're moving more into larger customers who are doing bids and signing contracts and accepting those committed or awarded relationships. While we expect that trend to continue over time and that percentage to likely continue to tick up, we've also talked about the fact that it does ebb and flow a little bit based upon market conditions and the account management decisions with each of our thousands of customers.","So, this year we talked about coming into 2016 that we felt the market conditions warranted and our account managers executed on making sure that we stayed near the top of their out guide and staying very high in our committed or awarded freight and you see the results of that in 2016. I don't think that will change significantly for 2017 as the market tightens like we discussed during the second half of 2016.","Each of our account managers will be working with their customers to make sure that we're responding to their needs in approaching the market in an appropriate way. Sometimes when prices are rising, if shippers are too aggressive on wanting to try to save money, we do have to back off of some of those awarded commitments if we don't think it appropriately matches the market. So, that's why sometimes the growth of that will fluctuate or move around a little bit.","But in general we view that those higher value integrated committed relationships have served us well and that's what a lot of our customers want and need and we would expect that trend to continue over time.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, John. Next question for Andy, why is headcount X acquisitions going up at a time when technology allows you to deliver better services with fewer people?","John Wiehoff","I\u2019ll reference to some of my earlier both prepared remarks, as well as - and some of the earlier answers around that. I mean we have a fundamental and for people that - there are others that maybe take a different approach, but fundamentally we believe that you need quality people to service your customers. Yes, technology is absolutely important, but I think the debate remains that you can deliver better service with fewer people and I'll speak specifically around our Nav team and they've done a great job.","The volume is 10% in the fourth quarter while only adding 2% of the people. So, I would argue that we are actually doing a great job of being more effective in servicing our customers and the stuff that you can automate. We're absolutely spending money to automate in that area. On the Global Forwarding side, you look at the productivity measure of that came over adding resources and showing up in the growth. So we don\u2019t believe that you can put up an app and you can put up a system and therefore just remove the human and the personal experience and knowledge it comes with that, from the entire transaction as it relates. There is a lot of imagination that go into a global fording move, a simple one even as moving as John mentioned ocean freight from China to U.S. We are investing in data scientists, we are investing in technology people just like by the way ever one of our competitors are to really drive great volume, great revenue and ultimately great earnings growth through the organization, that\u2019s we are making these investments here.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, Andy. Next question for John, a very large ecommerce player that has been moving into the transportation space recently opened an office near your headquarters to head their push into the middle-mile truck brokerage market. Have you seen any impact from the recruiting retention perspective?","John Wiehoff","So, for those of you, who may not be aware - the Minneapolis market place is a pretty healthy environment in terms of our concentration of not only large companies with over 20 Fortune 500 companies but in addition there are number of very technology focus companies in town here. So the good news of that is that we have a long track record of working in a very competitive market with a lot of very large and effective IT shops in town that we have to make sure that we source our talent and interact with that market place to every day. So there have been some new entrants but the answer is no, we haven\u2019t really seen any change in the competitive landscape, we have to pay our people competitively and recruit our talent across a number of great organizations and we feel very good about the strength and depth of our team and haven\u2019t seen any movement in terms of changes in retention or recruiting tactics.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. To Andy, LTL margins have held up nicely even as many formally truck load only brokers had entered the LTL space. Why do you think that is the case and would you expect the superior and steady margin to persist going forward indefinitely in the LTL space.","Andrew Clarke","I don\u2019t mean to sound like a bit of a broken record but I am going to go back and reemphasize, we got a great LTL service teams, we got great people and we got great carriers. So when you combine and some really good technology that allows us to be with a largest LTL broker by wide margin. A multiple of our competitors and the reason that is, we got a great service to sell our customers we have a great value proposition that our people are out there and the mass network selling every day. And we got a great LTL service team that backs them up because they got great relationships with the LTL cares and those LTL cares have been able to provide a great service we go and we are able to effectively sell a solution to customers and we partner with those carriers and I think it matters to them that we are a partner for them in providing a valuable services to our customer. So other people are going to continue to enter the space they have been. There are truck owners [ph] there some smaller competitors that are in the marketplace, we respect them but our team has been and always be on our toes and continue to drive to the best in class results what they have.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. To John, with truck load volume up 10% year-over-year in an otherwise uninspiring freight market, what were the primary drivers of volume growth? Was there an attempt to buy market share in a difficult environment. Did you add newer account as a result of some of the new sales into our marketing activities, pretty much of the growth come from penetrating existing customers more deeply?","John Wiehoff","We are several years into some enhanced go to market strategies that our leadership teams have implemented where we are segmenting customer opportunities and adding sales people to go after more aggressively in the market place. In 2016, we did have in the North America segment and really for the company as a whole to we had a record number of, what we would call new customers, so new opportunities where we previously didn\u2019t have a relationship and its new freight to the network. We also have a lot of account management practices where we are trying to get incremental freight and opportunities from current customers and did grow our business in that way as well to. So we are very proud of our go to market tactics. As Andy laid out in the freight world, each relationship especially in the committed or awarded world has some unique connectivity around EDI mapping and service expectations, so lot of the process EDI mapping and service expectation.","So lots of the process is digitized but each relationship is unique in terms of understanding the service relationships and the types of data that you may want to exchange. So lot of effort was put into, both identifying the opportunities and selling our value proposition and then getting those new customers integrated in ways that are customized to each opportunity. We don\u2019t ever use the term kind of buying market share, that\u2019s not the way we would think or kind of go to market but I think where that part of the question is headed, does relate to what I mentioned earlier that in a very competitive bid environment which there was a year ago with general market expectations of declining prices. There are account management relationships where we will make the decision to accept lower prices based upon market conditions warranting that and the bid results requiring that. So there are times when we are making decisions to stay at the top of the road guide and taking some margin risk on what the actual cost of hire maybe coming in those future years.","So we talked about the fact that in our good customer relationships where we are making those commitments and honoring committed or awarded freights it does give us some margin exposure which we have experienced in 2016, even in those relationships though we are constantly working towards profitability and long term profitability relationships with those customers. So we did feel very good about our volume growth and success during the current year and it is much more than just sort of lowering prices or buying share if you will. But it is a lot more involved process like I just described.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. To Andy, is the company seeing any actual pickup in demand or sell rate pricing following the election or is it more about expectation that this stage. How has the election impacted your branch managers\u2019 outlook for headcount in 2017?","Andrew Clarke","To the forward question in terms of what we have seen as John mentioned in his remarks, the rate of growth particularly in volumes during the quarter were essentially flat. We did not see any material pick up post-election in that as it relates to our outlook for adding headcount 2017 again. I think it is too early to make a long term determination as to what is going to unfold in 2017 and as a result we think about headcount as we have been talking about for quite some time now. We are going to add where we need to reflect volumes that we have both in the Global Forwarding business as well as make surface transportation business, technology, data scientist; we are going to continue to invest in those areas.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John, have you been able to buy truck load transportation less expensively so far in the first quarter of 2017, where customers of Robinson willing to observe price increases here in early 2017. Or can we expect the same margin dynamic we witnessed in the fourth quarter to repeat in the first quarter of 17?","John Wiehoff","We shared in the prepared comments that January to date what we saw was very similar to the fourth quarter. I think the important thing there is that a lot of the pricing bid activity and committed or awarded freight opportunities are happening and will happen over the next few months. I would share that when our teams are reporting back is that a year ago while there were expectations of meaningful price reduction in most of the lanes that is not the case now. The environment is more flat to modest increases depending upon again there are often times thousands of lanes involved and there is a lot of granularity and the re-pricing that gets aggregated into these overall trends. So it is the different environment versus a year ago but not where their general acceptance of meaningful price increases crossed high volumes of businesses.","The interesting part about that though is you know we have talked often in the past about how difficult it is to forecast the cost of higher and the changing market conditions, truly as the foundation of why we don\u2019t feel comfortable giving guidance and trying to firmly predict what these markets are going to be. January as always seasonally a little bit slower than the remainder of the year and it grows towards the spring time and big changes in the supply and demand environment, typically happen either on the demand side with freight or weather related compounding when we were getting more of a higher peak season out in the spring. So just like always a lot will be remained to be seen over the next couple of months around how bids continue evolved and how the markets supply and demand dynamics workout over the next couple of months.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. To Andy, broadly speaking industry expectations are for ELDs to reduce into three [ph] capacity by 5% to 7%. Can you talk through your expectations for industry capacity especially in the second half of 17 and how you view the potential impact from ELDs on your business?","Andrew Clarke","Yeah, we have been getting this question pretty consistently since the regulation came out and as far as what we have seen it and we have talked about in my prepared remarks how many carriers we signed up during the quarter which is pretty consistent. We have been signing up new carriers, a lot of new carriers and those carriers are running a lot of loads for us throughout all the second half of 15 into 16 and we expect that to continue quite frankly through 2017. I let the experts speak about what's going to happen through industry capacity, we do know that there will be some productivity issues that will come up and going back to all of my statements around the value that we bring. We allow our customers to access capacity in the marketplace and we are going to continue to do that. We don\u2019t expect anything to happen materially either in first half or even in the second half of 2017 because the rule regulation does not take effect until the end of middle of December, the end of all way 2017. So it is probably more of a 2018 issue but we are going to continue to talk to our carriers, we are going to continue to inform our customers of the potential impacts that may or may not take place and have discussions around how we are going to help them, keep their supply chains up and running effective and efficient. ","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. Next question is for John and just based on time, this will be last question of the morning. Is it possible to grow organically in your intermodal operation to a scale where can compete head to head with JB Hunt or Hub Group or with that have to be accomplished via an acquisition or a more sizeable operator already possessing intermodal mass.","John Wiehoff","Yeah, we do think that we have a competitive intermodal offering and that we are going to be able to grow it organically. Scale is an advantage particularly around the size and scale of your network and I think for somebody like us we just have to be more tactical around the lanes and types of freights that we can compete in and continue to look for opportunities to grow that organically. We shared in the past and say that from a capital allocations stand point intermodal is certainly one of the areas within our North America surface transportation that we would be willing to commit capital and gain scale if we can find the right opportunities within there. But in the mean time we can grow it organically and we can be competitive, we just have to be smart about the types of opportunities and the right types of customers that we can find to work with to gain share.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks John. Unfortunately, we're out of time, again we appreciate all the great questions and know we weren\u2019t able to get to all of your the questions.

(NASDAQ:CHRW) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call April 30, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Tim Gagnon - Director of Investor Relations and Analytics","John Wiehoff - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer","Chad Lindbloom - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President","Analysts","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson First Quarter 2014 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, Tim Gagnon will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, April 30, 2014.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, the Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Gagnon","Thank you and good morning everyone. On our call this morning will be John Wiehoff, Chief Executive Officer; and Chad Lindbloom, Chief Financial Officer. John and Chad will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our first quarter and will follow that with a response to pre-submitted questions we have received after our earnings release yesterday.","Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate the discussion. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Chad will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments.","I'd like to remind you that comments made by John, Chad or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John to begin his prepared comments on Slide 3, with a review of our first quarter 2014 results.","John Wiehoff","Thank you, Tim, and thanks to everybody who is taking the time to listen to our first quarter call. A special thanks to all of those who pre-submitted questions. We over a hundred good questions and it really does help us prepare and modify our prepared comments to address many of them as possible, and as Tim said, we will have some specific Q&A follow-up to really make certain that our messages are clear.","On that Side 3, with our overall Q1 results for 2014, I guess the introductory comments that I would like to make is for those of you who have been following our story, I think the first thing you probably recognize compared to last year is that our financial statements are much cleaner and we do not have necessary a pro forma financial information for this period.","As you probably know, last year with the sale of T-Chek and the acquisition of Phoenix and Apreo, for the year we presented the pro forma information to try to be very transparent and show what we felt is the right standard to hold ourselves accountable to around the pro forma or comparable growth for the combined businesses that made explaining and understanding things a lot more complex last year and we don't have to deal with that this time around, so it's hopefully going to be a cleaner, simpler set of explanations in our numbers quarter-over-quarter should be comparable.","Second topic I would like to address as I know that the word for the quarter is whether, and if you see the word whether our first bullet point as well too. Culturally in the past, we have tried to avoid talking about the weather and using that as the explanation for a lot of the variances and looking at our first quarter and really managing through it, it just became clear that it really did impact us in a lot of different ways.","Unfortunately, based on our business model, it's not possible to quantify precisely what the impact of that weather was. We know it had some significant impacts, some challenges and then probably some rebound or opportunity from it, so as we talk through the various parts of it, we will try to do the best that we can to share what we believe the impact of weather was, but it's not possible for us to quantify or even really give a reasonable estimate of what the overall whether impact for the quarter was.","Last point, I would like to make from an overall standpoint is that when we think about the amount of transition that happened in the marketplace during the quarter, particularly in the North America Truckload, our largest source of revenue. There is no doubt that this was the most significant amount of marketplace change and challenge that occurred in quite a period of time and I really do feel it's important to point out just how proud we are of our team and the value that we believe we added to the marketplace during the quarter.","Our results haven't always been the best ever over the last couple of years because of some of the changes and challenges that we have had, but I really do believe that our team is as good as it's ever been and we were very proud about how we adapted to some very aggressive changes in the marketplace and when you think about the weather conditions in the market, there were many days and many periods of time where everybody involved is feeling the stress. You have the truckers and the capacity providers, frozen and a truck stops and not getting as many miles as they should be and not be able to achieve what they need to do. You have our people working as hard as ever and in many cases getting less rewards, because of the pressures and changes that are going on and you have got shippers who are trying to deal with price increases and absorb them in business models they were planning on them, so really it is hard on everybody when the market moves that aggressively and I think it just represents a period of time where our team can help and help our customers get through it help it after market conditions and we do feel very good about how we did that during the quarter.","Those introductory comments on Page 3 for those Q1 results is just to make sure that I highlight those key metrics that we look at. Our total revenues grew 5% in the first quarter, with net revenue being essentially flat with last year.","Income from operations was down 7% and net interest income decreased 9.8%. You see the earnings per share of $0.63 versus $0.64 a year ago. Obviously the earnings per share was held by the share repurchase activity and changing capital structure that Chad will touch a little bit more on later.","Lastly, our bullet point on Slide 1, talks about results improving significantly in March, and during our year-end call I mentioned that we were seeing continued margin compression throughout January and elsewhere in our deck it talks about results improving into March, but that our first quarter overall remained impacted by the fact that our costs rose faster than our ability to pass those along in net revenue margin compression.","We talked a lot about try to how to share the best visibility to the improvement during the quarter and typically for us net revenue is probably the best gauge of that, so we wanted to share that for the month of January and February, that from enterprise standpoint, we did have a mid single-digit decrease in our net revenues offset by a low double-digit increase in net revenues for the month of March that got us roughly flat for the quarter.","As we have talked about in the past, whenever you look at monthly information there's probably other things that you should consider. For certain, the impact of the weather was probably more detrimental in January and February and probably some rebound in March. You can see shipping days that were less in activity when weather storms went through different areas, volumes got better in March, how much of that was a rebound of the weather, it's is impossible for us to tell in our network, but there was probably some of that impact.","You've got timing of holidays, Chinese New Year and Easter moving around that can make an impact in our business as we have talked in the past. Monday is typically our bigger revenue days. There were five in the month of March, so there's a lot of things that you can adjust for that may not make those trends precisely accurate, but no matter how you adjust for the first quarter, there was significant improvement that that happened throughout the quarter and the month of March was much better and we want to make sure that we were clear about that.","Moving to Page 4, summarized income statement, really just has a couple of additional data points to touch on. Breaking out some of the operating expenses with personnel being segregated here, so personnel expenses increasing 3.6% for the quarter. That resulted from an average headcount year-over-year of 6.1% offset by variable pay reductions. We have talked a lot in the past about our variable compensation models and how when we make investments of additional personnel costs that were accountable our teams are accountable for generating a return on that, so the variable incentives will be penalized by the additional costs that comes in until we get the return on that.","We talked last year about adding headcount throughout the year and investing in our network. We talked last call and at the beginning of 2014, about leveraging our currently sources and trying to generate the return on the investment that we had made, so what you see sequentially is that our headcount was virtually flat during the quarter, so from the beginning of 2014 till the end of the first quarter, but year-over-year the average headcount was up about 6%.","Additionally in the SG&A category the 7.5% increase, as the comments suggest, was driven largely by an increase in the bad debt provision. Chad will make some comments about that later, but aggregate results reflect our total operating expense increased to 4.5% and income from operations down 7%. The other metrics that we talk about a lot and really monitoring in our business is that operating income as a percent of net revenue what you see was 34.3% for the first quarter of 2014.","Moving on then to Slide 5, and starting to get into our various service line comments, we start with on Page 5, the slide that aggregates all of our transportation results for the first quarter. Total revenues for transportation increased 7.7% for the quarter, with net revenues being of 1.6%. Net revenue margin for total transportation decreased 90 basis points for the quarter to 15.3%, which you the in the upper right-hand box of the lower chart at 15.3%.","As I mentioned earlier that net revenue margin did compressed for the quarter compared to 2013, but improved throughout the quarter and was stable year-over-year in the month of March. When we look at the total transportation margin, there's obviously a lot going on at this level. There are mix issues and there are a lot of changes that can impact it, like we have talked about in the past.","At one level, I think this is very helpful data, because it is really showing in aggregate what's happening with our total transportation services and many of our services are related to each other around air and ocean or truck and rail tradeoff and integrated management services, but on the other hand, it's very helpful to kind of get into the individual services to really understand what's happening with regards to volume and margin for each of those, so this is the enterprise transportation results in the margin compression that you see at that level.","Moving then to our Truckload results on Slide 6, which is our largest source of revenue in the area of the business that has the most change, so I have the most prepared comments on this area of our deck to try to help you understand what happened during the quarter.","First off, in terms of data points, the net revenue for Truckload increased 0.5% 0.5 for the quarter with volume increasing 4%, North America truckload volume growing at 3%. In the upper right-hand corner of the chart shows one of the key metrics that we often talk to, which is the average cost per mile and average price per mile for the quarter in our Truckload services and that is showing that our average pricing or average cost charge to the customer went up 10% for the quarter, average cost paid to the carrier went up 12% for the quarter. Those are some pretty important metrics and I wanted to walk you through some reminders and some additional data points around that information to try to help explain some of the questions that were submitted and to make sure that you understand what we do about our business.","For starters, what I want to remind you of is that our business is decentralized and we have a decentralized network, we have decentralized account management and pricing practices. Those practices are supported more and more by corporate resources around benchmarking and automated tools and its more and more collaborative process. However those account management decisions are made uniquely and are made differently for each relationship that we have in the field.","We do not have a standard or enterprise definition of a committed freight relationship or a standard committed contract. There's a lot of commonality across them. Most of our longer term customer contracts have an annual expectation. Most of them have a 30-day out by either party and most of our large top-500 customer relationships will have some element both, of awarded freight or promised freight as well as other freight which can be expected, it can be transactional and unexpected, it can be a whole bunch of different things, but I think it's important to remind yourself that during a period of rapid change like this we have a network that is acting very local in some respects, but is being controlled in other respects by some common processes across the top of them.","When you look at our first quarter results and take more than a $2 billion of freight, what we try to do it the end of it is aggregate that data and slice and dice it and understand it better and share the metrics that we think are most relevant to understanding our business and help adjust our management processes and do what we need to do to run the business better.","In the Truckload part of it, one advantage that we have is, there is a common denominator around rate per mile, which can be very helpful to look at and that's what we are disclosing here. You don't have that in LTL and other parts of the business, which is easy to do, so we share that because we think it's a pretty meaningful metric.","However it can also be confusing in some other respects too or not send the right message, we want to make sure that you understand what the computations are and what the pieces for that, so first off, it is an average rate per mile that is charged to our customers, an average rate per mile that are paid to our carriers. When we start to analyze it, there are some really significant variances across the types of freight in terms of how those price increases or cost increases would apply.","For instance, when we look at a sample of those larger accounts and those more committed or contracted rates, the typical rate charged to the customer increase is in the low to mid single digits, much more what you would typically see in the marketplace or expect based on some of the other companies that you're working with.","When we looked across that database, you also see some very significant price increases from the transactional or spot market-type relationships that we have, some obviously much more significant than 10%. Even within a given relationship, as I mentioned earlier, most of our customers will have a combination of awarded and committed freight that we will be honoring at historic prices, generally for a year and there will be additional spot bid that many of them run or transactional opportunities that can occur as much different pricing, at much different margins, so it gets very complex in terms of categorizing and understanding exactly what's going on, but the 10% and 12% is relevant and does come across the entire database as the average charge to the customer and the average part paid to the customer.","As I mentioned earlier, I want to repeat that in March and to-date in April, our net revenue margin has been flat, so while the 10% and 12% were the quarter numbers, it did level off in March, and year-to-date in April, for the Truckload portion of it. The actual price increases vary significantly. The other part that's important to understand which there is a bullet point that's addressing is how mix can impact the average rate per mile in this.","The most important impact of mixed in the quarter really deals with short-haul freight. There has been a trend in the marketplace towards more short-haul freight and less longer haul freight. We saw in Q1 an even greater shift. We generally consider short-haul freight to be less than 500 miles. We are not completely certain why it's shifting greater for us than the rest of the market. We do have a focused emphasis on that in terms of adding value with outsourced customers and other things and there's a broad marketplace trend that would support that, but we do feel like our business mix is perhaps shifting a little bit more than the market toward short-haul freight.","As those of you who follow the industry know, that short-haul freight can have a much higher rate per mile just based on the economics of short-haul freight, so when we are blending together again more than $2 billion worth of freight and we saw a significant increase in the short-haul piece of it, that mix issue can impact and did impact in Q1 those averages that were sharing with you.","There could be other mix-type things around the cost of service expedited or refrigerated or other things, there wasn't a lot of variance that we could quantify or explain for Q1 with that, but mix can impact those average numbers.","The last metric that we think is relevant to pull a lot of that analysis and share with you is around the negative loads as the bullet point shares there. That really gets to the point of the committed relationships and honoring our customer commitments when the market moves dramatically like this. We've shared with you in the past that we always have a certain element of negative loads in every quarter regardless of the market conditions. In some cases, it's bundled freight. In other cases, it's just pricing decisions or investments that are made in different parts of the business. That number moves around and it's not a metric that we want to share regularly or quantify, but we have shared with you often in the past that it typically is in the mid-single digits of our freight mix and I do think it's important to understand that we want to share that for the last couple of quarters and in Q1 that number has moved up and for Q1 was roughly double of what our normal averages have been, so it's an important metric that we look at.","It's really reflective of the fact that we do honor those annual customer contracts that when the market moves like this, we have talked often about how we will continue to honor those contracts even if they requires us to invest or lose money on those relationships until the opportunity is appropriate to re-price the contract and move forward, so that's one data point that we look at in terms of analyzing our pricing and determining what's appropriate to do with each customer and how to go forward in the marketplace.","There's a lot here, I know it's the most important part of the business and we could analyze it forever and talk about it the rest of the day. There is some Q&A addressing it. I think those are kind of the highlights that we think are the most important part of the truckload services that we wanted to get out to you.","Moving on then to Slide 7, in our LTL services, net revenue increased 2.8% for the quarter, while volumes decreased 2%. Weather did also appear to impact shipment activity in January and February, so a similar pattern with not the same level of recovery or net revenue growth. Cost increases also are occurring in the LTL area and we continue to work with evolving that pricing and adjusting is appropriate similar to the Truckload side of it.","As I mentioned earlier, given the variances of tariffs and classes of freight and all the difference, it's really hard to get down to a common denominator that's helpful to understand exactly or quantify some of those aggregated price increases, but the phenomenas for LTL are generally similar to what we talked about in the Truckload area.","Moving on then to Slide Eight in our intermodal services, intermodal net revenue decreased 1.8% for the quarter. Intermodal volume decreased 6% for the quarter. As those of you who follow the industry know this is the area of transportation or perhaps you can quantify some of the metrics that are best around the impact of weather with slower trains speeds and lesser utilization of the equipment, we did see that in our limited owned equipment where there was less sufficient use of it and the inability to generate the same level of volume around that equipment.","As we have talked in the past, while we have less asset density and less of our own committed network there, that's a disadvantage from a scaling and efficiency standpoint, but probably a little bit of an advantage with less idle time and inefficient use when weather impacts the negativity around that.","Moving on then to Slide 9, our global forwarding results for the quarter, Ocean net revenues increased 2.6% for the quarter while Air increased 4.1% and Customs Services up 8.4% in net revenue for the quarter.","The ocean market continues to be volatile and competitive with all of the changes that are going on, so we did have some net revenue margin compression, but it was more than offset by volume gains. We had good results in our air business with margins being up in a large part, due to the benefits from consolidating and integrating our global forwarding businesses and creating better margin opportunities. We have also seen steady growth in our customs brokerage services with increases in both, the net revenues and the transactions associated with that.","Side Nine is where you see the greatest example of the simplicity in our financial statements, and going forward, we will be talking about the C.H. Robinson global forwarding business and less and less about the integration of Phoenix International, but just to kind of touch briefly on that the bottom slide talks, it talks about systems initiatives ongoing in 2014, and that probably being the most significant component of the overall integration plan that we anticipated lasting more than a year and going on throughout 2014, so we are still on track as we expected but have some remaining cleanup to do under the integration umbrella. Then that will evolve into just like every other area of service or business line that we have, where there will be quarterly releases and ongoing metrics to improve our operations and streamline the transaction flow of our processes.","The other point I wanted to make about our global forwarding business, you know, when we acquired Phoenix International at the end of 2012, I talked earlier about the changes and the complexity that we are involved with understanding and integrating the business. One of the things that we do feel very proud about is that if you look at that pro forma information from last year and the first quarter of this year, that every quarter last year and the first quarter of this year we have had a net revenue increase in the combined businesses of our global forwarding, so while we been working very hard to create one network and have made tremendous progress on that, we really like are offering today and frankly are just getting started at more aggressively cross-selling and going after some of the consolidation and operational efficiencies that that will come with it because we spend a lot of time and money laying the foundation and making sure that we had one combined business.","Despite all of that focus and attention that had to go into that and all of the competitive pressures that result from a transaction like this, we are pretty proud of the fact that we grew our pro forma revenues for every one of those quarters during that period of time. It wasn't just growing the net revenues by acquiring down. It was growing that combined pro forma base and really building a stronger foundation to hopefully go after those opportunities in the market.","By the way, the market conditions during this period of time have not been all that strong. There have been some challenges in there. As you know, our biggest source is ocean and Trans-Pacific Eastbound is our corridor and we do continue to look at that and hope that at some periods of time in the future that the underlying market activity will have greater growth and really even support our growth in a better way there.","Moving on then to Slide 10, the prepared comments on our other logistic services are very similar to previous periods. This represents the non-transportation portion of what we do; the net revenues increased 8.8% for the quarter compared to last year.","As a reminder again, this service category includes primarily transportation management services and also some warehousing and small parcel revenues. As a constant reminder, while this is an important source and growth of revenue for us, it's also more important in the standpoint that the services are primarily offered to transportation customers and they are integrated in with those account management relationships and are key part of how we bring a combined value to many of these customer relationships.","Our last service line is sourcing. You see sourcing activity, our net revenues for the quarter decreased 15.7%. We have talked in the past periods about some of the challenges in our sourcing business around loss of some of the dedicated business from a large customer relationship, sourcing is another area where we definitely have some weather-related challenges in managing the business. There were freezes during this period of time that impacted some of the citrus categories that we are a part of.","There are routs in California that we are concerned about with regards to some of the commodities and the volume that will be associated with those in the coming quarters. I can assure you that we are doing everything to manage the business and adapt to market conditions in the sourcing area as aggressively as we are in any other part of Robinson, and we still have long-term confidence in our ability to grow this, but the lost dedicated business and the weather impacts on some of the crops just have a longer cycle time to normalize, so we do expect some continued challenges and headwinds in terms of working through some of these issues, but we do feel that long-term, the fundamentals of the business are good and by the end of the year we will be back into more normal conditions hopefully weather permitting with our sourcing business.","I will pause there and turn it over to Chad for some comments on our financial information.","Chad Lindbloom ","Thanks, John. I am going to cover some information on our cash flow and our balance sheet and then we will turn it back to John for the look ahead slide.","During the first quarter of 2014, our cash provided by operations was $14.4 million. You can see that last year, there was actually cash used by operations of $58 million. John mentioned that most of the comparability issues of the transactions of selling T-Check and acquiring Phoenix are behind us. There was one lingering impact in the first quarter 2013, which is actually the payment of the income taxes related to the gain on sale of the divestiture in 2012, so that had approximately a negative impact to the first quarter of 2013's cash flow of about $100 million.","You can see if you adjust for that $100 million of cash flow from operations was actually down in the first quarter of 2014 compared to 2013. The driver of that decrease in cash flow compared to last year's quarter, was primarily investments in working capital as we had accelerating revenue during the quarter which increases both, our receivables and our accounts payable, but as those of you have been following us know our accounts payable is always lower than accounts receivable, so we did invest significant amounts in working capital.","This incremental investment in working capital impacted the amount of cash we had available to repurchase shares. While remain committed to our strategy of returning approximately 90% of our annual earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, the first quarters tend to be lower. The reason is in addition to the growing working capital, we also have our bonus payments which happen at the end of January.","Moving onto share repurchase activity, in February our ASR was terminated by the remaining bank and we were delivered approximately 1.2 million additional shares. In addition, we used only about $8.2 million net for share repurchases during the quarter. The bulk of that was shares withheld on delivery of restricted stock to recipients.","Our capital expenditures during the quarter including software were $12.3 million and are in line with the expectations that we laid out last call for $40 million to $45 million of capital expenditures during 2013. We ended the quarter with $142 million in cash and $910 million in debt. We are comfortable with our current liquidity position.","With that, I will turn it back to John for our look ahead slide.","John Wiehoff","Okay. Thanks Chad, the last, Slide 13, around a look ahead just to share some thoughts and comments on what we are seeing in the marketplace and how we are managing. I think, the first bullet point is an important one around truckload market conditions remain difficult to predict. When we have talked about our business in the past, we've talked about the fact that it is very difficult to forecast. It's very difficult, almost impossible to give accurate guidance. The core of that is the fact that we are sourcing that truckload capacity on a daily basis and are exposed to market movements that can move very aggressively and we predicted Q1 in the middle of Q1, we probably would not have predicted it accurately and I think it's very difficult to know exactly how markets are going to move in the future.","Over the last three or four years, when we have talked about the balanced market conditions and what was happening in the North American in truckload sector, we and others talked often about the possibility that at some point in time you could see significant price increases based upon a reduction of capacity and a balanced market that really probably wasn't well positioned to accommodate significant demand increases if and when they occurred.","Not a lot of people or maybe nobody anticipated a weather-driven tipping point in January and February that created some of the most significant price increases and market changes that we've seen in a while. There's uncertainty as to where we go from here around that. I would say the most popular question internally in interacting with customers during Q1 was, how much of this was whether and how much of it was the change in market conditions and it's clear that nobody really knows that. It's impossible to determine I think from an overall standpoint in terms of what exactly it's doing to the pricing and the market conditions, but it does feel like, the way the market has evolved over the last three or four years with the tightening of supply chains and information by shippers and the limited capacity additions by carriers that we do have a very tight market that maybe is as difficult to predict or a volatile as it's been in a long time.","Chad Lindbloom","","That's the first thing that we are understanding and trying to manage to internally and with all of our customer relationships. I commented earlier that North America truckload net revenue margins in March, and thus in April are flat with last year, so what that means for the month of April, when we have talked about in the past about sharing what we do know. What we do know is thus far in April, our net revenue growth on a daily basis has been around 10% in North America Truckload.","It can bounce around quite a bit day-by-day and month ends and quarter ends can have a significant impact. It's also important to remember that we are talking about North American Truckload here that we do have headwinds in other parts of our business and most other services are not growing at that sort of place so we do see the recovery in the Truckload margins for the last couple of months, which we haven't seen in a while, but in a very unpredictable environment.","Talking a little bit about our team, I commented earlier about our pride in and how we manage through and serve our customers during the quarter. I talked at the beginning of the year about the investments we've made in the past and how we are thinking about as a leadership team and how were making these decisions collectively. They really are bottom-up made, very similar to talk I about with account management and pricing. There is more and more collaboration in top-down input around the productivity metrics and the hiring processes within our company, but it still is a very collaborative process to make sure that we are adjusting to each part of the business in each market opportunity in the best way.","If you connect a bunch of the previously shared comments around the fact that for the last several years, we were investing pretty heavily in hires in North American surface transportation, we do feel that in these sort of market conditions relying on our experienced people to adapt and serve our customers and honor those contracts and adapt the market conditions makes a lot more sense than trying to bring in a lot of new team members and aggressively go after market share in a capacity constrained environment. ","For last quarter and this quarter and the foreseeable short-term future, we are managing that business with the current resources that we have and feel we can execute our go-to-market strategies and grow the business with the investments that we've made over the last couple of years.","We talked in the global forwarding integration about the fact that we were going to try to keep all of our team members, and over a period of time try to harness the top line and bottom-line synergies of productivity and cross-selling and all the rest of that, so in our global forwarding business, we feel like there is capacity and the network to continue to grow and pursue with the combined team and capture those synergies going forward.","In our sourcing business, we have some resource redeployment opportunities from the business that's in transition there and we always manage our shared services and overhead functions to kind of correlate with the business, so it's not a simple top-down edict to just not add people. We also have turnover in our business that we have talked about in the past, so that at any point in time we are constantly refreshing the pipeline and looking at where can we add the right sorts of people and evolve the workforce into the right types of jobs to move with the business, so talent planning and our people are still our most important asset and we are putting more energy into it than ever, but at the same time we do feel like for the foreseeable short-term future, at least the next couple of quarters, we can continue to work on harnessing the return on some of the investments that we like and have made over the past couple of years from our team standpoint.","Then the last point is really pretty straightforward, that our business has always been about adapting to market conditions and helping our customers and carriers adapt to market conditions as well too and it's more important that we do that and we will continue to monitor the market activity, the pricing, our team and adjust very quickly as things progress in the market.","That includes the prepared comments. From there, I will turn it back to Tim to moderate some of the prepared Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Tim Gagnon","Thanks John. As John stated, I personally thank all the analysts and investors that have submitted questions, a lot of great questions. John has [read] as many responses to some of those questions into his prepared comments that's including Chad as well, but there were over 100 questions as mentioned, so we have a lot of unique topics to get to and I'll jump right into it here and I'll ask the question and then I'll turn it to John or Chad to respond.","The first question is for Chad, and I will read it verbatim here. The $220 million in personnel expense in the first quarter was fairly meaningful step up versus the second quarter '13 to fourth quarter '13 run rate. Was this increase primarily headcount-related and is it a good quarterly run rate to use for 2014?","Chad Lindbloom","","Okay. My comments will really compare first quarter to the fourth quarter of 2013, because that's where most of the people asked the question was Q4 to Q1. Although, our headcount was only up slightly compared to year end, at the end of the first quarter our average headcount, when you compare quarter four to quarter one was actually up slightly over 100 heads, so during the fourth quarter we were adding heads to get to that ending number. During the first quarter of this year, we kept headcounts roughly flat, so therefore in effect there were more heads than that. It's definitely part of the increase. Every year we have phenomenon in quarter one, where our payroll taxes go up significantly compared to quarter four.","By the end of the year, many of our people are over their social security limits therefore there is no expense for the FICA expenses of those employees. During the first quarter, many of our employees actually maxed out because of the payment of their bonuses, so payroll taxes were up. I think it was an increase of over $7 million compared to Q4 in Q1.","Restricted stock expense, we talked about this is during our fourth quarter call. We actually had a credit in restricted stock expense in Q4, because we ended up having 0% vesting one by the end of the third quarter of last year look like we would have some performance days in vesting, so we had to reverse the accumulated expense from the first three quarters and we did have some vesting expense on unrestricted stock and options during Q1.","Those two are by far the biggest variances between Q4 and Q1. In addition to the headcount increase, I think, our average salaries grew less than 2% on a quarter-over-quarter basis.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks. Chad. Then the next question is again for Chad, and it's related to personnel again. You talked talk about wanting to leverage the investment you made in personnel and operating expenses in 2014, but we didn't see that in the first quarter year-over-year results. Should that be more evident in the second quarter results or is it something you expect later in the year?","Chad Lindbloom","My response to the previous question as well as something John said in prepared remarks kind of address, but just to be abundantly clear, our stated goal was to leverage our year-end headcount. Our headcount grew significantly during 2013. We're still online what the target. Our headcount is roughly flat. I think it's up 27 heads compared to the end of the year, so comparing to our goal was not have flat headcount with the first quarter, but to leverage the heads that we had at the end of the year.","Actually, even if we don't add significant headcount, our expenses might grow as the year continues, if growth continues, because we will have increases in cash incentive pay as well as restricted stock vesting.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Next question related to bad debt and for Chad again. Can you give us some more color on the increase in bad debt expense? Has there been any change in your strategy to pursue a different customer segments or was this just an isolated event?","Chad Lindbloom","","Unfortunately this is the second or third quarter in a row where we talked about isolated events, but basically they were. Rather than just looking at the increase, I will talk about what made up the $6.3 million provision. In quarter one, as we mentioned earlier, our receivable portfolio grew significantly. We do some calculated risk analysis to establish a reserve. The increase in our gross receivable portfolio made up about $2.4 million of the $6.3 million total provision.","In addition, we had two different significant specific reserves booked during the quarter, which totaled approximately $4 million, so it is not a change in going after different market segments. The variance was really driven by those two significant customers, one of which is a customer who was a moderate credit risk, who suddenly had a deterioration in their business and another customer was one were closely monitoring and also had some changes in their business that made it prudent for us to reserve the receivable.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Next question, again for Chad, before I turn it back over to John, is the number of offices held by three in the quarter to 282 from 285 at year end. Will there be further closings and what are the savings?","Chad Lindbloom","","That particular reduction was based to one move we made a Minneapolis. We had four operating branches that were already shared and already consolidated in more sharing office space and we consolidated the management of that to be led by one general manager to try to leverage and scale some of the efficiencies within there.","There might be late changes from that combination, but really there were no significant headcount reductions or no significant changes in the staff, so hopefully we are going to be able to grow that business faster and leverage some expenses going forward, but nothing significant in immediate term.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks, Chad. The next question is a Truckload question for John about capacity. As freight flows normalized post the weather, any sense that carriers are actually not that busy or has capacity remained tight in van reefer flat bed.","John Wiehoff","I started to touch on this in the prepared comments, but we have seen in the month of April some softening of what we would characterize as supply and demand relationship in April relative to the first quarter, so for that, what that would mean from us is that we are not seeing a lot of the extreme spot market activity or extreme difficulties in truck deficits and sourcing capacity.","It has not however softened to the earlier market conditions of a balanced market with adequate supply and demand in all markets like we have been talking about for a number of years, so I think it's really sort of fits the pattern of what I talked about earlier that while there were some whether-provoked extremes during the first quarter, that probably precipitated a bit of a tipping point attitude around pricing and tightness in the marketplace and while a lot of that whether impact has subsided, there does remain a different market conditions today that we see versus the past couple of years.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks John. The next one again for John in the area of truckload, Organic truckload volume growth of 4% seems a bit low given the market dislocation. Can you expand on why CHRW was unable to take advantage of this to drive better volume growth.","John Wiehoff","We don't have great metrics yet on what the market probably did for Q1, but we do acknowledge that that 4% growth was probably more in line with market or that we didn't take a lot of market share during the first quarter.","If you connect some of the previous comments that I have made around how we honor our customer contracts and how over the last three or four years, our business has move towards a much greater mix of committed and contracted freight, we knew coming into the year that in the fourth quarter and early first quarter as the pricing started to change aggressively and we started to think about our customer relationships and how best to serve them in a very capacity-constrained market that going after a lot of volume growth in Q1 didn't feel like it would be the right answer for us to balance the combination of honoring those existing customer commitments with trying to grow our business and pursue the additional opportunities in the market.","While we did that, and do that every quarter in terms of selling and looking for new business opportunities, we did not have as higher volume growth as we have had in quarters or would hope to have in some of the future.","Other comment that I would make is, there have been periods of time in the past where markets have tightened and we have had greater volume growth, we have talked in the past about the uniqueness around these tight market conditions maybe being more driven by supply constraints rather than an increase in the demand from shippers.","If you think through the dynamics on that, when there is incremental freight in the marketplace that just hasn't been bid or planned, but there is ample capacity to rerouting and go extra miles. It does create a more favorable environment for going after volume, when capacity constrained environment like this with a lot of existing customer commitments it doesn't bode well to both, serve your customers and go after a lot of volume increases.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks, John. Next question, again, for John. It's more related to some of the look ahead comments. What's more important for 2014? Volume growth and sustaining market share or price to improve margins?","John Wiehoff","Based on the last quarter and on this question there were a number of follow-ups around, you know, has our strategy changed to focus more on price or what's more important around price and volume. I think that the thing that's important about that is, in our long range plan, we talk about the foundation of making Robinson a bigger, better company to create value and to serve our customers. It's about gaining market share and expanding our footprint and expanding our services, so market share gains are the long-term objective and we will never stop pursuing those.","We have a lot of different go-to-market and sales initiatives that we are pursuing. When the market is moving as aggressively as it did towards the end of the fourth quarter of '13 in the first quarter of '14, simultaneously aggressively pursuing market share and adding a lot to the team like I said a couple times is not the best way to manage the business for our customers or for our long-term profitability, so it's always a blend of the two of those. It's not a change in strategy. It's an adaptation to the current environment and the market conditions.","We will continue to focus on serving our customers, honoring our contracts and adjusting to the pricing changes in the marketplace in the short-term future with some foundation of pursuing continued market share gains and will adapt to a different mix of those initiatives when the market tells us it's time to do that.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. Moving on to the next question related to net revenue margin. You indicated in March and April that transportation net revenue margins have been flat year-over-year. Do you think we passed through the trough for net revenue margin?","John Wiehoff","Last fall, when we talked about our long-term growth targets and managing our business we said that we manage the company and those long-term guidance goals were based upon margin stabilization. We understand that because of our business model and because of the industry that margins are going to fluctuate. We expect them to fluctuate just based on supply and demand and how things work in the marketplace, but our long-term business planning and those long-range goals that we set out do assume margin stabilization, so we have had margin stabilization in our largest service for the months of March and so far the April, that feels positive.","Have we passed the trough? I think, there's too much uncertainty and too much volatility in the market today to state definitively that we passed the trough for that things couldn't go one way or the other for the remainder of the year. It's is possible I think that margins could go up or down based on what we see in the market and how we are managing our business today, so we pride ourselves on how we adapt to the changes and being prepared for either scenario and hopefully we will continue to see some sustained margin stabilization for the remainder of the year, but we are not predicting that. We are managing our business based on the certainty of that happening.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks. John. The next question relates to spot market versus contract business. What was your mix of contractual versus spot business in the quarter? How did this compare with the year ago?","John Wiehoff","It's a common question and tried to set the stage for that in the prepared comments around the truckload services that without a standard definition and an enterprise framework for applying that, it's not that we know those percentages and are being cute by not wanting to share them, because we simply don't have a standard definition of that, but when you slice and dice that database of our activity for the quarter, what we do know as we have shared many times over the past couple of years is that a higher and higher percentage, much more than half was tending towards awarded freight and more committed freight, particularly with larger customers who do the bids and look for those longer-term commitments.","When the market starts to move like it has, a lot less freight will move under those awards and there will be less freight that is rebid, so it will naturally sort of shift to a little bit greater mix of spot market or transactional freight just based upon the pricing in the supply and demand dynamics in the marketplace.","Where it goes from here, we will see. I think, a lot of the business changes that we made around integrated services and automated processes, it is our goal to keep that contracted or committed freight percentage fairly high, because we like the long-term growth and the stability of the relationships that come with it, but we also hope that there are opportunities in the future with hopefully more supply coming into the marketplace that greater growth on the demand side that we could pursue a greater spot market opportunities as well.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. The next question goes back to Chad related to earnings. Given the rapid rise in spot rates and increased volatility are you more or less confident in your net revenue and earnings per share guidance for the next couple of years?","Chad Lindbloom","","Thanks. As you know, we haven't given short-term specific guidance. We have set our long-term EPS growth rate at 7%, 12%. We agree that the market is extremely volatile. As we have mentioned earlier, we also believe it's still very difficult to predict. That said, volatile markets are better than prolonged weak freight environments like we have been experienced for the last multiple quarters.","Based on what we saw in March and so far in April, we believe the market is better for us to achieve greater earnings growth than it has been in quite some time. However, that market could change at any time.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks, Chad. The next question back to John here and it relates to less-than-truckload. Could you provide more detail of the decline in LTL volume? What caused the decline and is it expected to rebound in the second quarter?","John Wiehoff","I commented earlier that similar to the truckload, there were volume declines in January and February that, we believe, correlated with some of the severe whether days and disrupted some of the networks, the fact that our volumes didn't recover to the same degree in the LTL area is probably a combination of less success on our part in terms of selling and that baseline of market share gains. It is a very competitive market. There is always a constant churn of some other customer activity, particularly the more transactional stuff, so a combination of less success on our part and some weather-driven volatility of gaining market share.","It is absolutely our goal to grow volume and to gain share in future periods. Again, it's a competitive market and who knows what the future will bring us, but that it is our hope to continue to grow the volumes in that area.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. The next question is again for John, and on the topic of intermodal. Intermodal growth expectations are still pretty strong and we have seen some announcement of container adds by larger intermodal company, so I am wondering if there has been a change in your strategy, any plans to become more asset-intensive to better compete in this business, especially as it looks like demand and pricing power is improving as the truck market tightened and not having your own assets was a hindrance this past quarter.","John Wiehoff","We have said and I would repeat again that intermodal is a very important part of our service offerings and we are committed to doing whatever it takes in order to make sure that we are relevant to our customers and a part of that marketplace going forward. As many of you probably know, in the past we have had greater asset ownership in that intermodal area phased out of it and now we have some containers and are constantly exploring what are the right types of investments to increase that capital commitment that the density of our network to better serve the customers.","It's a complex circle of talking with customers, talking with our rail partners and looking at the opportunities in the marketplace to figure out when and how to do that most appropriately, but we are definitely open-minded to it and looking at how to successfully grow our intermodal business in the future.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks, John. The next question, again, to you and related to the Europe, and [question] here. Are you eyeing growth in Europe?","John Wiehoff","We talked in our Investor Day and I have mentioned it, I think, since then several times that Europe is one of our key growth initiatives from two points. One is, our European surface transportation that one of our executive leaders (Inaudible) for the last couple of years has really been driving an expansion of our European surface transportation truckload and less-than-truckload with some office openings and driving some sales investments around expanding that network, so Europe is a strategic commitments for us and we are investing in having higher growth expectations for the future on the European continent.","The other part of our European business is, our global forwarding business, where we are underrepresented relative to our presence in Asia and North America, but are also looking at investing in additional human capital and locations in the future to try to strengthen that part of the network. When you put together the regional shared services will support the global forwarding and surface transportation opportunities as well as some additional management services and outsourcing-type things that we can build off of that. Europe is an important strategic commitment for us that we are investing disproportionately into the last couple of years.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. Just the basis of time here, this will be our last question and the question is for Chad. It's related to share count. Could you provide the end of the quarter basic share count? Just trying to get the starting point for 2Q.","John Wiehoff","Sure. The ending basic share count was approximately 148.1 million shares. The ending diluted count was approximately 148.6 million shares.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks, Chad. Unfortunately, we are out of time. We got too many questions, but certainly not all. We apologize that we could not get all the questions today. Thank you for participating in our first quarter 2014 conference call.","The call will be available for replay in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.chrobinson.com.

Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) Q4 2013 Earnings Conference Call February  5, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Tim Gagnon - Director, Investor Relations ","John Wiehoff - Chief Executive Officer","Chad Lindbloom - Chief Financial Officer","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the C.H. Robinson Fourth Quarter 2013 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today\u2019s presentation, Tim Gagnon will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 5, 2014.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, the Director of Investor Relations.","Tim Gagnon","Thank you and good morning everybody. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, our Chief Executive Officer; and Chad Lindbloom, our Chief Financial Officer. John and Chad will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our fourth quarter, and we will follow that with a response to pre-submitted questions that we have received after our earnings release yesterday afternoon.","Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate the discussion. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Chad will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments.","I would like to remind you that comments made by John, Chad or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management\u2019s expectations.","Before I turn it over to John, I would like to mention that similar to our first three quarters earnings releases, we have provided pro forma financial measures for net revenue and income from operations to provide meaningful insight and an alternative perspective of our results of operations. We believe that these pro forma financial measures reflect an additional way of analyzing aspects of our ongoing operations, that when viewed with our actual results, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business. A reconciliation of actual results to pro forma numbers is provided in Appendix A and B at the end of the slide deck.","With that, I will turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments on Slide 3 with a review of our Q4 2013 results.","John Wiehoff","Alright, thanks Tim. Thanks for everybody listening into the call. I am going to start my prepared comments on Page 3 of the deck that show our GAAP reported earnings for the year and then we will have a lot of comments on this page, because as Tim said, while the 2013 results are reflective of our ongoing business, the 2012 numbers are not comparable because of the transactions that are reconciled in the appendix.","Looking at Page 3, I think a couple of data points that are relevant is just for the year 2013, our total revenues of $12.7 billion does reflect a 12% increase over the prior year. That increase is about half organic growth and half acquired revenue largely from the Phoenix International acquisition and obviously scale and size do matter in our business and it is important that we continue to grow that top line and have a stronger presence in the marketplace so that we can take advantage of our scale and size in the marketplace.","If you look at the EPS for the quarter of $0.62, again it\u2019s not comparable to the prior year. In our earnings release and pro forma information, it shows $0.66 as the pro forma adjusted for the prior year. Obviously, we are not happy with the $0.62 or the $2.65 of EPS for the year. This 2013 marks the first time in 16 years as a public company, where we were not successful in growing our EPS over the previous year. In addition to the decline because of the gains and the transactions of the previous year, it also is down from the pro forma numbers on the following page that I will talk to more. So we understand it\u2019s a disappointing finish to a challenging year and we are committed to changing and making sure that we improve that in the future.","Turning then to Page 4, this is a page that I will have most of my comments on. Again, it\u2019s reflecting the 2012 numbers adjusted to exclude T-Chek for the entire period and to include Phoenix International\u2019s history for the entire period even though we did not own the business for all of 2012. Page 4 has most of the key metrics that we look at in terms of evaluating our business and performance starting with the total revenues that I talked about before. I mentioned that about half of our top line growth or 6% of that $12.7 billion came from organic growth. So if we are looking at the pro forma information here, that\u2019s the 6.2% increase in our total revenues. So you can see that was for the year in the fourth quarter that book slowed to 3.8% in revenue growth.","If you look at the net revenue, an increase of 1.3% for the year, but a decline of 2.1% for the fourth quarter, so both the revenue and the net revenue declining more in the fourth quarter or growing less than the year-to-date numbers. Similarly, when you look at the operating expenses, we have always talked and continue to believe that the appropriate way to look at that is separating personnel and non-personnel or SG&A expenses into the two different categories. You can see the year-to-date increase of 6% of total operating expense and the fourth quarter increase of 4% for operating expenses. So the expense growth in the fourth quarter, the growth rate did slow, but obviously not fast enough in relation to the net revenue change and how the business is performing. So income from operations for the quarter down 11.6% on a pro forma basis.","As I mentioned earlier, EPS was not shown on this slide, but that would show for the quarter $0.62 of EPS diluted compared to the previous year of $0.66, which is about a 6% decline. Chad will make some comments about share repurchases and the changes in the capital structure. So that part of the strategy is working in terms of the decline in earnings being less at the EPS level than it is at the income from operations line.","Couple of other metrics on this page that are important, we always talk about our operating income to net revenue relationship. So you can see for the year 39.9% dropping to 37.2% for the year-to-date. As a refresher, for those of you who have followed the story when we went public 16 years ago, that was at 28%. It got up to around 42% at the peak in 2008 and \u201809. And over the last four or five years as we have had a more challenging environment, it worked its way back down to 37.2% for the year. In that operating income to net relationship, there are some mix issues. Obviously, we have talked a lot about Global Forwarding and the fact that it is a global more overhead intensive business that changes some of the mix. You see some of the acquisition amortization up above that changes, the benchmarks or components of that operating income to net revenue and then the acknowledgement of reduced profitability over the last five years, all having an impact on that relationship.","It is important to look at the year-to-date stuff, because a lot of our costs are annual in terms of annual incentive contracts and a lot of different operating expenses that will get trued up on an annual basis. However, the current quarter showing pretty 38.7 down to 34.9 does reflect what I mentioned earlier that with a decline in net revenue and a increase in operating expenses that obviously puts downward pressure on that ratio and that happened more in the fourth quarter than it did on a year-to-date basis, but that operating income to net revenue is a key metric that we continue to look at and the deterioration of it is being driven by topics that we have talked about at length over the last four to five years primarily truckload margin compression. More than half of our revenue comes from truckload services and we will talk more about it, but that\u2019s obviously the lead driver. In this quarter, there were some lost business in our sourcing service line that also had a pretty significant contribution to it.","Last comment I will make on this page is that when you look at operating expenses and we will talk in this call about how we intend to manage differently and approach the expenses differently. But if you look at 6% year-to-date operating expense increase and personnel expenses of 4.8% increase, elsewhere in the decade shows that we had about 7% headcount increase. And for a number of years now we have been talking about investing in our network and investing in our personnel to go after market share. And part of what I think is important to understand is that we do have a very high pay for performance culture at Robinson.","And everyone of us that\u2019s making those decisions around the balance of hiring and market share goals and gains versus the profitability of the corporation, the pay for performance has driven a significant reduction and realized pay over the last five years. And again while we are adding people to the network the personnel costs are not growing at the same percentage as the level of heads that we are adding primarily because of a reduction in variable pay programs that impact all of us at Robinson in terms of the performance. So we do feel that that is the strength of the model. Its part of what aligns our decision making with our shareholders and it is something that we will talk more about as I talk through the remainder of the deck.","Turning then to Page 5 on the total transportation results, this schedule really highlights some of the challenges that I have already referenced in terms of our margin contraction and our performance. If you look at the total net revenue growth of 1.7% for the quarter and 11% for the year, again the year was driven primarily around some of the acquired net revenues. I think it\u2019s helpful to look at the longer term trends on the net revenue margins, so we this longer term graph that we have been referencing for the last several years. If you look on the year-to-date down lower right hand portion of that chart that shows the 2009 to 2013 total transportation net revenue margin percentages. You see it moving from 20.2% in 2009 to 15.3% in 2013.","Over the last four years we have talked at length on a lot of questions and comments, today I will get back to these same topics. But really if you look at the economic recession and the change that happened four and a half years ago, probably the dominant topics that have been affecting all of the transportation results and margins, but especially the North American truckload are in addition to the cyclical fluctuations that we always have had and will have that showed some of the peak in 2009. I would say the other categories of environmental changes are just around changing supply chains and how shippers are focusing on efficiency rather growth.","On the truckload side you have the cost changes, the regulatory changes, CSA, hours of service all those things that have changed the landscape of the cost of capacity and the truckload component of the cost equation in our business. A lot of changes around technology both shipper investments as well as 3PL and competitor investments in technology and the transparency and the changes around pricing that it\u2019s leading in all of the different services and then just the escalation of competition and the changes in the competitive landscape especially in the truck brokerage world and the third party landscape. So you see all those factors over the last five years, we have been trying to ourselves as well as responding to questions to try to understand the components of that and what is driving it, but obviously over the last five years since the recession the combination of all of that has put downward pressure on our margins that has impacted our results.","When you look at the transportation business as a whole for 2013 with somewhere around $11 billion of total transportation services and then you look down below and factor in conservatively 4% to 5% margin compression, that margin table down below also has some favorable mix shift to higher margin businesses, primarily Global Forwarding and management services when you look at the longer term transportation. So if you look at a business of around $11 billion of transportation with again considerably 4% to 5% margin compression over that period of time, while somewhere around $400 million to $500 million of margin opportunity or margin comparison on that $11 billion of freight. Over that five-year period of time, we have been able to modestly grow our operating income to somewhere around $100 million or I think low-single digit percent. So it is I think important to understand that if you look at the scale of the business and how we have gone after market share that while we have been under margin pressure and we have been under a lot of competitive stress that we have done a lot with our variable pay and we have done a lot in the scope of our network and productivity to try to manage our results and get through this in a more favorable way.","Moving then to Page 6, some comments then on each of the different transportation services, obviously starting with truckload, it is more than half of the net revenue of the business. We did see some very meaningful tightening of our North American truckload market in December and January. I have shared in the past the types of metrics that we look at to gauge that market dynamics around demand and supply. One of the primary ones being the route guide performance and route guide deterioration to look at if freight is moving as planned or if there is a lot of change or disruption. For us, I know in the industry there has been a lot of discussion about improved environment and changes, what we did in December and January is some pretty meaningful movement in the deterioration of those route guides and some tightening in a lot of different areas of capacity that has continued to lead through some disruption and price increases.","So in the past, several quarters when we have talked about customer pricing increasing in a 2% to 3% range and carrier costs increasing more than that, which you see for the fourth quarter of 2013 is that our customer pricing on average for the quarter up 3.5% for a mile, but the carrier costs increasing at around 5%. So both of those numbers moved up fairly aggressively during the quarter, moved up even more aggressively in the December and January. We will come back to that topic more in 2014 and some of the Q&A, but one of the things that a lot of the themes around the questioning is how we are we adapting to pricing, how are we adapting to the changing market. We are moving \u2013 pricing moved in the fourth quarter, pricing is moving in January, it really is more a function of the fact that as we talked about the last four years in this balanced environment, we have moved to a much more committed relationship with the vast majority of our customers to take market share and to grow in a balanced environment which was required during that period of time.","We have talked about the fact that when the market turns and depending upon how quickly and aggressively it turns it can take time to reprice business and to go after transactional opportunities that result as the byproduct of that and to a large degree which you are seeing in December and January is that period of time where things can get worse before they get better from a pricing and margin standpoint. And we have seen some pretty significant change in the North American truckload market conditions over the last 60 days.","Again, I will come back to some more comments around pricing in our truckload services, but one of the things that I think is relevant when you look at our 5.6% decline for the quarter. I know we have asked ourselves around that how long does it take to reposition the pricing, how long does it take to get after some of that transactional opportunity. And one of those things that we believe is unique or different this time versus other inflection points that are similar to this that we have had in the market is that for all the reasons that we talked about the last four years around the capacity shortage and some of the truckload challenges of driver shortage and the absence of new equipment coming into the marketplace. When you add on to that some of the weather challenges in the December and January period that we do believe that the contribution of tightness from the reduction in supply was probably more unique this time around then just simple growth in the freight side of it. Well, there is clearly some demand increase as well too and those are all the factors that we have to manage through. We do think that the dynamics around what\u2019s causing the tightness and what\u2019s the most appropriate way to manage through the transition in the marketplace does have some unique elements to it this time around.","Moving then to Page 7 on our LTL results, 3.2% net revenue increase for the quarter. Both costs and price moving up as we have said multiple times in the past because we use a variety of tariffs and different pricing things it\u2019s hard to quantify apples-to-apples exactly around what types of price increases are there, but there is no question that pricing is moving up both in the quarter and year-to-date with some more modest net revenue margin compression. So a 4% volume increase translating into a 3.2% net revenue increase.","And as we commented down below, while all of our transportation services and the 3PL market is more competitive than it was several years ago in the LTL arena, it does feel as though it\u2019s maybe even more competitive simply because of the fact that the capacity side is a more constant in the marketplace. In terms of access to it and things like technology are more important around the automation of the process. So it allows for more aggressive market share goals by us and competition to go after greater volumes of freight.","On Page 8, in our intermodal results, what you see for the quarter a 9.4% net revenue increase, less volume, but improved pricing and net revenue margin. We have talked over the last several years about our intermodal business and how it consists of more transactional and truckload conversion opportunities that we feel we are very capable of and do a good job of bringing our customers intermodal solutions where they pertain in the marketplace. It has been our challenge and continues to be to build our capabilities on the higher volume more dense intermodal opportunities. Those are generally served more effectively with dedicated container and dedicated rate solutions that contribute to efficiencies based on the volume. So while we have made some minor investments there, we do need to continue to work on our operating structure and the capital commitments that it takes to serve the larger, more dedicated intermodal opportunities and grow that portion of our business in a more sustainable way. So while we are happy with the 9% net revenue increase for the quarter, it really is more reflective of just ongoing re-pricing and shift of mix in the business rather than a trend that will sustain itself in the next couple of quarters.","Moving to Page 9, then I am talking about Global Forwarding erosion and customs business Page 9 reflects the GAAP numbers again, so what these numbers reflect around those net revenue increases of 37% for ocean and 12.8% for air, 36.7% for customs reflects a partial quarter of Phoenix activity rolling into our Global Forwarding results. Probably the most important point by our view on Page 9 is the bottom message that for the year and again in the quarter based on TEU ship rankings we were the number one NVOCC in volume from China. Eastbound that was one of the strategic goals as we have talked about with both Phoenix and C.H. Robinson having focused largely in that corridor in the past really retain and grow that volume in a way that creates a competitive advantage, so that\u2019s probably one of the most positive strategic achievements.","Moving on to Page 10, where the information that we presented in the past is in a more comparable format for our Phoenix integration update, I am not going to go into the same level of detail as I have into the past around the two year integration plan. But from a year one standpoint, the second bullet on this slide highlights some of the key things that we really did focus on in year one around office combinations, agent rationalization, gateway and operational processes and feel pretty good about how all that went and where we are in year \u2013 at the end of year one of our plan.","If you look at on a pro forma basis on the deck up above 8.5% net revenue increase for the quarter was our best increase of the year in terms of pro forma activity. You see 4.6% for the year on this pro forma basis. So what we have left is the more aggressive ramp up of cross selling and integrating some of the account management and growth opportunities as well as technology and driving further operating efficiencies in the Global Forwarding business during the year two and beyond with that.","Slide 11, the other logistics services reflects the continued efforts to diversify our business and focus on other than transportation solutions you see a 14% net revenue growth in the quarter. We continue to feel positive about the pipeline and the growth opportunities in here. And again I would say pretty every much every quarter that, while this is only 3.5% of the net revenue of the corporation of $67.9 million for the year 2013 that the customers that represent this service line also include significant transportation customers. So that when we think about it from a market share gain and account management standpoint, our capabilities to integrate with our customers in a more comprehensive way and drive value and solutions in the supply chain that go beyond transportation are an important part of the future and how we are trying to position ourselves from a strategic standpoint.","Moving then to my last slide on the service lines before I turn it over to Chad on Page 12, our sourcing results, what you see for the quarter is a 15% net revenue decline in our sourcing business and a 7% decline for the year. We talked about the lost business in our sourcing division in our last call, as well as our Investor Day comments by quick \u2013 just quick refresher on a couple of data points in our sourcing business. Its where buying and selling, distributing fresh foods and vegetables produce, predominantly the large retailers and food service businesses. The sourcing business at Robinson is more concentrated. There are about 20 accounts that make up well over half of the business. And it\u2019s predominantly the large retailers that have consolidated very similar to how the produce industry has consolidated.","The way we earn business in that division is generally by innovating and helping those buyers and sellers of fresh foods and vegetables to bring new ideas to the market. There might be products from a part of the world to create year around supply, it might be packaging innovation. It might be a promotional opportunity to expose new categories. Often times when we earn those businesses we get to serve them for an extended period of time around may be even managing the item or the category and replenishing and filling those orders for a long period of time.","One of the risks that we have is that when those buyers make strategic changes around how they are stocking their produce department or the types of items they are carrying or where they are sourcing from their vendors, we can lose orders. And in fact that\u2019s what happened with our largest sourcing customer in the fourth quarter is that we continued to see the elimination of some items that have been ordered from us for a number of years that resulted in last business and a net revenue decline for the sourcing business.","The net revenue loss from the lost business was the majority of the decline in the net revenues for the quarter. But there also were some weather issues that impacted the broader sourcing business and helped to contribute to some of the net revenue margin decline moving from 8% to 6.8% in the quarter. The weather things, obviously we believe will correct themselves and that we will able to improve some of those margin opportunities around the weather related items, but the lost business as it \u2013 we do expect that that will continue. We don\u2019t know with certainty until orders show up or don\u2019t show up. But at this point it looks pretty clear that lost business will continue to impact our sourcing results for the majority of 2014.","With that, I will turn it over to Chad for some comments on our financial section.","Chad Lindbloom","Okay, thank you, John. On slide \u2013 I am on Slide 13 now. You can see while our operating cash flow is down for the year on the GAAP perspective, the timing of the tax payment from the gain on sale of T-Chek had a significant impact. We had a positive impact of about $100 million in the last quarter of 2012 because the taxes for the gain are approved, but they were paid in the first quarter of 2013. So you can see on the third row of that chart if you adjust for the timing of those tax accruals and tax payments, we actually have significant increase in our cash flow both for the fourth quarter and the year compared to 2012.","Our CapEx including our investments in capitalized software, which is both internally developed software as well as purchase software. The total of the capital \u2013 of those capital expenditures for the year were slightly lower than the predicted at $48 million. In 2014, we expect to spend about $40 million to $45 million in capital expenditures including that software. Our total debt balance at the end of the quarter was $875 million, that was made up of the $500 million long-term debt that we entered into in the third quarter and the \u2013 we have $375 million outstanding on our line \u2013 on the revolving line of credit which has a maximum of $500 million.","Moving on to Slide 14, we have talked about our capital structure a lot lately, but I kind of recap what our current goals and plans are. We currently have a goal of distributing at least 90% of our annual net income through ongoing share repurchases and dividends. This goal could change based on investment opportunities or other capital needs. We expect maintaining this program will hold our debt balance somewhere in the range of 1 to 1.5 times EBITDA. As we have mentioned at our Investor Day, we would consider going as high as 2.5 times EBITDA for the right acquisition opportunity.","Looking at 2013 in specific, we used $310 million of cash in ongoing share repurchases and paid $220 million in dividends. These distributions totaled over a 120% of our net income. The higher than normal distribution was driven in part by our strong operating cash flows. In addition to that more normal ongoing activity, we entered into a $500 million ASR program with two banks. The source of the funds was the long-term debt that I mentioned earlier. One of the two banks terminated their ASR plan on December 11, which resulted in a delivery of an additional 1.2 million shares. The other bank\u2019s ASR is still open and we will close between now and April 16, 2014. The precise closing date of their ASR is completely at their discretion. If they have terminated their plan on January 31, they would have delivered us an additional 1.2 million shares. Our ending diluted share count was approximately 149.7 million shares and this will go down when the second bank closes their ASR.","With that, I will turn it back to John for one more slide of prepared comments talking about 2014 and forward.","John Wiehoff","So my comments are on Page 15, the 2014 thoughts and initiatives. On the top of that chart is a recap of our Investor Day, long-term growth goal, for those of you who didn\u2019t participate in that last year given the changes over the last three or four years and the changes in the environment through our long range planning process, we took a look at how we thought we could perform over a longer period of time given the environment over the last four years. What we did at that point is lower our long-term growth targets to something that we thought was more realistic of the types of market share gains and operating leverage that we could gain in a more competitive environment like this. We stated then and would reiterate now that, that plan assumes that margins will fluctuate, but it also assumes margin stabilization from the previous periods. When we communicated this plan last fall, we did not anticipate the more aggressive margin compression that we have experienced towards the tail end of \u201813 nor did we contemplate the lost business in the sourcing division. So, we still believe in that long-term growth target. We still believe that, that is our benchmark and a reasonable goal for the longer term next 5 to 10 years of C.H. Robinson performance, but results will fluctuate and margins will fluctuate and during periods of time where we have contraction, it will be difficult or we won\u2019t be able to achieve those goals.","So well, we still believe in that long-term growth target. The next bullet point talks about the fact that similar to the fourth quarter of 2013 our net revenues have decreased in January of 2014. We do not have our books closed yet and we do not have the precise numbers for January of 2014, but the themes that we have talked about on this call unfortunately some of them are carrying into the year in 2014, that market tightening on the truckload side that we discussed has continued to-date in the first quarter of 2014. Those price increases of 3.5 and 5 that I referenced in the fourth quarter those have continued to escalate into January. Again, we have to scrub these for the quarter and we have to look at fuel numbers, but probably something more in the customer pricing up 5 and carrier cost up 7. So, again, we have to get out ahead of this and at some point make sure that we stabilize or expand the margins that we are doing on our pricing. But as the market is moving, we are moving customer prices and we are reacting to the marketplace, but it has been a challenge to get out ahead of it and to manage through margin stability or improvement in the North America truckload piece.","In addition as I mentioned earlier, we have some of the lost business trends that are going to carry into \u201814 for a while. And while we will talk more specifically in some of the Q&A about the expense management, obviously the run-rate coming into the year is something that we have to manage down over time and is going to take a while to get in line.","Pricing will be a high priority in 2014. As I mentioned before that in these market conditions, we do have a long history of adapting to what\u2019s going on in the market and it\u2019s just a period of time where we feel like we can add a lot of values to our customers in the marketplace to adapt to these market conditions. We have to serve them and honor the commitments that we have made over the last year as these contract cycle through and we will get into some more specifics around how the pricing works and how we expect that to play out, but at the same time, it\u2019s very clear that in these changing market conditions that while pricing is always important that it will be a very critical focus for us in 2014.","The last bullet point of our growth continuing to be a top priority through leveraging our current resources, we do intend to manage differently in 2014. The firm leveraging our current resources does imply that we intend to have a different attitude about our hiring and our addition of resources to the network during 2014. We do believe that in the environment that we are in now and if you look at the various pieces of our business that what we believe in the investments that we have made over the last couple of years that during this type of market condition, we should be able to leverage some of those investments to continue to go after market share gains with current accounts and current resources that we have in place.","There is also a number of other things that we have been working on for the last couple of years around automation and operational productivity, regionalizing our North American business to share resources more efficiently across North America, and an enterprise sales approach around segmentation and going to the market more effectively that initiatives like that that we have been working on for a number of years to position ourselves for more competitiveness into the future. It\u2019s just become clear that in the balance of productivity and managing the cost structure versus growing the business and going after market share gains that we have to tilt that balance more aggressively and manage the cost structure of the company down more aggressively sooner than perhaps we have been thinking over the last couple of years. So while we will be working hard to improve price and to manage the margin and the customer relationships just like we always have, it\u2019s also time to prove some of the return on the investments that we have been making and go after market share gains with more aggressive expense management in our network.","So I will finish the prepared comments by restating what I said in the beginning. We are not happy with the fact that our earnings per share decreased for the quarter. The formula for managing this business is straightforward and is similar to what it\u2019s been in the past. You have to manage those account relationships and go after growth and business in the marketplace, manage pricing and margin and control the cost structure and productivity and balance with that to grow both your market share and your earnings. So there is a bunch of this that we have to own and we do and we are on it, we understand it, we know how to manage it and we will improve it. There is a bunch of this that is just reflective of a very challenging market dynamic and increased competition and changes in supply chains that may not go away in the near future, but we have to continue to adapt to the company and adjust to that.","Those are the prepared comments that we have. With that, I will turn it over to Tim who has organized the questions that were submitted. So we can go through the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Tim Gagnon","Thank you, John. Let me first start by thanking all of the analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions. We received a lot of great questions and we will do our best to get through as many as we can in the time allotted. John and Chad will kind of share in the duties to respond to the questions and I will facilitate by first asking the question and then either John or Chad will respond. So we will get right into that now.","And the first question is for John and it relates to headcount. So why does headcount still need to go up at such a rapid pace relative to net revenue? How long does that continue, our employees beginning to get somewhat disgruntled with the pay for performance incentive comp structure due to recent performance? And has that lead to higher turnover? So, a lot there.","John Wiehoff","Okay. So, some of this was covered in the prepared comments with the fact that we have been doing over the last couple of years what we have done for the majority of time, which is to look at our headcounts, investments largely in correlation to volume while we have always had productivity initiatives and we have as many today as we ever have. Our historic benchmark looked at headcount and staffing additions highly correlated to volume. As I stated in the comments, we do have a different approach to that during 2014. It\u2019s not without risk. We have to drive market share gains and productivity in the network and obviously we want to be smart about the balance of that. So the tradeoffs between market share and investing in the network and adding resources to go after it versus margin and productivity is something that we struggle with everyday, but we are taking a different approach going into 2014.","To the question of employees with variable comp and incentive pay and is that causing turnover or morale issues, I don\u2019t think our industry is unique in the standpoint that expecting more with less has put some strain on our workforce. And as I mentioned earlier the variable pay and pay for performance culture that we have does create tension in our network around the fact that people are working as hard as they ever have and in many cases making less money for it. I think that\u2019s just a reflection of the times. Statistically, I don\u2019t, our turnover has not accelerated, although anybody who is involved in any service business you know that it\u2019s more about which turnover you are having and are you keeping the right people those who are still on the bus motivated with the right morale. And it\u2019s a challenge that we have to manage just like every other business that is going through margin compression and productivity expectations. But this company has a very strong culture of pay for performance. We all understand it. We are all part of it, and its just one of the risks of the business that we will have to continue to manage.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks John. Second question is for Chad. Does CHRW have any meaningful cost levers remaining to pull? Is it possible to drive further cost from the network or does further margin improvement now depend on volume increases and pricing?","Chad Lindbloom","As you know the bulk of our operating expenses are personnel. John, both in his prepared remarks as well as answering the last question covered a lot of the personnel expenses all focused on SG&A. We also believe we have some room to leverage our SG&A expenses in 2014. We have always aggressively managed our expenses and will continue to do so in the future. We have received some questions about Phoenix integration expenses doing away. From the time of the acquisition, we have said that people managing the integration are the leadership of the company, not external consultants or dedicated people. There are still significant ongoing integration work into 2014, both the systems as well as integrating the go to market strategy that John mentioned earlier.","We believe we have a strong team that will now begin to focus more on the integration of sales and the go to market strategy and growth as the other integration efforts reduce. Our total SG&A expenses for 2013 including amortization was about $327 million or about $82 million per quarter. When you look at the pro forma Q4 2012, you will see that that was $80 million for the fourth quarter. Many of the SG&A expenses are predictable like rent, communication cost, depreciation, amortization, many others are far less predictable like claims and bad debt expense. Because of this, our SG&A expenses will continue to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.","In 2013, we had $74.3 million in the first quarter, $84.7 million in the fourth quarter. In Q1, we have low bad debt and claims expense. In Q4, we had relatively high bad debt and claims expense, so that made up \u2013 those two expense categories made up of our half the variance between the high and the low for the quarter. We feel like the average of $82 million is a good benchmark for 2014, it will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter like it always has, I am sure and obviously the first quarter will be a relatively difficult comparison.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, Chad. The next question is for John. Your guidance assumes that gross margin stabilized. Do you think that it is \u2013 that is possible in 2014? Do you expect to meet your long-term EPS guidance of 7% to 12% this year?","John Wiehoff","I addressed this somewhat earlier, but obviously with the net revenue decline in January and continued margin compression with the run rate of increased expenses, it\u2019s not realistic to assume that margins are going to stabilize or that we will achieve those long-term targets in the first part of 2014. So the answer would be no. We still do believe in that long-term target. And as I mentioned earlier through re-pricing efforts that can take a couple of quarters and better expense management throughout the year, we do believe that our earnings growth opportunity is much better in the second half of 2014 than it is in the first quarter.","Tim Gagnon","Okay, thanks John. The next question again for John, how did weather impact your business in the fourth quarter, what impact as that had quarter-to-date?","John Wiehoff","I mentioned in the sourcing area that a number of the crops that we buy and sell and distribute were impacted by weather throughout 2013. Some of those volumes were impacted in the fourth quarter as related to weather freezes and different things that happened. So there was definitely an impact in the sourcing business. In the transportation business, there were days in December and January, where you could correlate to really cold weather and the absence or decline of transportation volumes. In the past, we have always believed that most weather activities that volume would come back after a period of time, I don\u2019t know in some of the January whether that was true or not, it does feel like some of the worst weather days in the month of January did diminish volumes pretty significantly, where there wasn\u2019t a corresponding rebound to it. So that\u2019s another thing that we will study more over time, but it does feel like weather was a contributor to some of our challenges over the last couple of months.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. The next question is for Chad, what are your growth expectations for Phoenix, which to us means Global Forwarding in 2014? Are there additional opportunities to benefit from the company\u2019s increasing buying scale this year that did not benefit results in 2013?","Chad Lindbloom","Right. We have talked about the combined marketing and the increased focus on cross-selling and going to market with Phoenix in 2014. We believe that we will continue to add market share. So obviously a lot being a major player in the Trans-Pacific lane, a lot of how well we do and how quickly we grow will be dependent on how fast the market grows and we will \u2013 we also feel comfortable that we will continue to add market share. As far as leveraging the buy scale, yes, we think we still have some room to grow. The new ocean contracts went into effect in May of 2013. So for the first four months, we are operating under the old contracts of both Phoenix and C.H. Robinson. We think that these new contracts will continue to add the efficiency and we also feel like the more we get the two companies integrated from an operational perspective, we will find even greater opportunities to consolidate volume, to increase the profitability of our LCL business, which will create greater density and also continue to leverage the progress that we have made in our air gateways.","Tim Gagnon","Okay, thanks Chad. The next question again for Chad, can you discuss how CHRW did season with customers\u2019 works namely when does it begin and end and is there a bellwether customer that sets market expectations for pricing?","Chad Lindbloom","Our transportation business is very fragmented or very diverse with the large number of customers. No transportation customer is greater than 3% of our business or greater than 2% actually. So there is no single bellwether customer that really signifies what we think rates are going to do. When you look at, I have read about the industry and when we look at our own contracts, 70% of contracts happened in the first half of the year or even in the first four or five months of the year. Obviously, shippers choose to bid when they feel it\u2019s \u2013 when it\u2019s advantageous. Sometimes shippers, even if contract expires, will continue to try to tender us rates under those old contracts. That is the point of view of the shippers. Robinson and almost all of our truckload contracts as well as the industry as a whole have the ability to raise prices during a contract. Obviously, every time you do that, you risk losing freight or creating a competitive situation, which could lead to lost freight. As John mentioned earlier, we are going to continue to focus and focus even harder on our pricing with our existing customers and we may lose some business through that, but we understand the need to address some of our lower margin business on a case-by-case basis with customers throughout 2014.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, Chad. So the next question is for John. North America truckload volume growth meaningfully decelerated in Q4 \u201814 or Q4 \u201813 to up to 6% versus 9% in Q3 despite a strong spot market, we think \u2013 we typically think of market volatility as a favorable environment for a broker to operate in as they generally benefit from additional spot market opportunities as large carrier capacity get soaked up. Were there factors that constrain CHRW\u2019s ability to leverage the strong spot market last quarter to grow shipments? Do you think more of the spot market traffic is going to the brokerage arms of asset-based carriers?","John Wiehoff","So there is a lot of components to that question and it ties in briefly to what I talked about earlier that going into this year and currently we do have a very high volume of committed customer relationships. So when the market begins to tighten like this, it puts strain on those margins and on those commitments to serve as the customer commitments that we have out there. The transactional volume increases require a shipper that\u2019s willing to pay more. They require available capacity to actually meet that transactional opportunity. And again, in our world, the boundaries between committed and contractual and transactional vary more than they would for an asset carrier, where it\u2019s clear whose equipments the freight is moving on. So we do see an increase in transactional opportunities and spot bids and trades like that, that we are going after, but we are not as successful in adding significant volumes of transactional freight as we have been in periods of the past when the market begins to tighten. Whether the shippers are actually choosing to ship at a higher rate, at what degree they are doing that, we know some of it, whether we are winning as much share around that in the past or not, whether competition is the bigger factor, it\u2019s hard to tell. If we are missing out on that freight, we don\u2019t necessarily get informed, where it\u2019s going whether it\u2019s an asset-based competitor or another broker or where that freight might be going. So that\u2019s something that we are definitely monitoring. And as our market conditions continue to change, it is a clear point of emphasis to make sure that we are pursuing transactional opportunities in addition to our committed freight.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks John. And the next question again for John, in your prepared remarks, you had indicated that truckload rates to customers increased 3.5% year-over-year while costs were up 5% year-over-year, how did these two measures trend in January? What percentage of CHRW book of business is currently operating under contractual agreements? When do these contracts predominantly end?","John Wiehoff","As I mentioned earlier that in January, the sort of preliminary estimates were more around pricing up \u2013 customer pricing up 5%, cost up 7%. And remember in our business, since we are working with predominantly meeting with small carriers who like a very fluid pricing arrangement that the vast majority of our truckload capacity is sourced on a fluid or spot market type basis, where the percentage of the freight that works with the customers is much more committed. Again, the definitions vary in each account, the definition of commitment and how long that last varies by each account. Most all of the contracts have 30-day notification periods, where as Chad mentioned earlier, we can propose different pricing, but then it all comes down to the load acceptance and the volumes on how each shipper and carrier in the marketplace are balancing the changing market conditions. So as I mentioned earlier, we revisit pricing daily. It is an hourly topic around here, around monitoring where we have margin issues, where we have losses and the pricing adjustment that it takes to correct those and it is thousands of unique relationships and account managers to figure out what is the right technique and timing in terms of adjusting those margins.","Tim Gagnon","Okay, thanks John. And the next one again for John, we saw some robust trucking activity in late November and for some of December and if the market tightness seems to be continuing in January. Isn\u2019t this the type of market volatility during which you have historically enjoyed significant share gains? Do you feel that will be the case in Q1? How long does it typically take for your net revenue margin to stabilize after an inflection in truck demand?","John Wiehoff","When we look back over the last 10 or 20 years, assuming history is a relevant guide for how we will react and how we will be able to adapt these things. On average, it can take two to three quarters for pricing changes to go through. Now, it\u2019s dependent upon the time of year, the severity of the tightening and the price increases. I don\u2019t know if December and January is indicative of what 2014 will be like in its entirety or if things will escalate in terms of tightness, but it can take a quarter to at least to get through the more committed business and re-price some of that. And again how successful that is depends upon how well we anticipate the future market conditions. We have commented a lot over the last four years that with the increased pressure on a lot of our customers around their supply chain in the competitive factors, price increases are challenging to get through in today\u2019s marketplace. That will continue to change as market conditions change, but if you look at the environment over the last four years, it does make for where, this is hopefully an inflection point and hopefully an opportunity to add more value to our customers, but it does take time to work through and probably two to three quarters would be the right guide from a historical standpoint.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. The next question is for Chad and a sourcing question. Do you expect your sourcing business to grow in 2014 at the 4% to 8% long-term rate you are expecting? Is there any other color you can give on the large customer you have lost in terms of dollars or impacts of overall net and margins as well as EPS?","Chad Lindbloom","Okay, I will start with the question about the overall impact of the large customer. It is our \u2013 they were our largest customer in sourcing and will likely be either customer number one or two after this. So I think it\u2019s very important to understand that we did not lose the customer as John mentioned there are just certain commodities or that they are not going to order \u2013 that they don\u2019t plan on ordering from us going forward. As far as quantifying that, it\u2019s based on what we know today, it\u2019s somewhere around 10% of the total sourcing net revenues. As John mentioned sourcing has a much more concentrated customer base for us and we did lose a significant portion of the customer, but expect that to be at least 10% of our net revenues. As far as well we grow at our long-term rate in 2014 that would be extremely difficult to achieve. Our sourcing division does have plans to return to positive growth even with this 10% headwind, but that is an admittedly aggressive plan. As far as operating margins and EPS, our sourcing division has operating margins about equal to the consolidated numbers. So really the answer to that question is how successful will they be at replacing the net revenues.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks Chad. The next question is for John and an intermodal question, are you interested in intermodal acquisitions, does the XPO, Pacer deal change, how you think about expansion in the intermodal space, if you aren\u2019t looking for intermodal M&A, are you thinking about adding to your own container count. What else can you do to increase your presence in the intermodal segment of the market?","John Wiehoff","I started to discuss this earlier, I am looking at our results and we feel very positive about our knowledge of intermodal market, the relationship between truckload and intermodal and where it makes sense to ship by which mode of transportation and our ability to execute on an intermodal shipment. The challenge that we have or the growth opportunity that we have is in the more dense freight, the larger volume commitments where asset commitments do serve those relationships better. It just creates so much more operating efficiency that it\u2019s very difficult to be price competitive if you don\u2019t have that. So the answer to the question is yes we are interested in both, we are interested in looking at continuing to grow our organic capabilities with either more equipment commitments or dedicated drayage type solutions that will help solve that business or if the right acquisition opportunity comes along that we think will create value and be able to be well integrated into our culture that we would pursue that as well. So we are very interested and committed to growth in the intermodal space and are looking at both whatever type of investments that we could make to move us forward in that.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks John. Next question for Chad, CHRW recently lowered its long-term growth target, is the company planning on revisiting its long-term incentive compensation to reflect CHRW\u2019s new targets to try to help employee morale retention?","Chad Lindbloom","We are constantly analyzing our compensation programs, balancing the variable cost model with the maintaining our employee base. So yes we spent a lot of time on this. When you look at the equity grants that were made to the leadership, so the top 350 or so people in the company basically branch managers although we have two executives and corporate directors, we did change the vesting formula for our equity. So instead of it being the average of operating income plus \u2013 the average of operating income and EPS plus 5%, we went to EPS plus 10%. Again this is just for the new awards. The vesting formula for the awards that were granted previously to December of 2013 stays at their original growth plus 5% formula. Last year so the \u2013 beginning last year so the awards done in 2012, which is the vast majority of the people, but a small amount of the total, relatively small amount of the total amount of the equity awards, we went to time-based with them as we have previously announced. So those more individual contributor and key up-and-coming leaders in the network, their equity awards are time-based. So we did adjust equity programs. We have not adjusted any of the other programs at this point.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, Chad. Unfortunately, we are out of time. I apologize that we couldn\u2019t get to all the questions today.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Angie Freeman, C.H. Robinson's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Freeman.","Angela K. Freeman","Thank you, Douglas. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, CEO; and Chad Lindbloom, CFO. John and Chad will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our second quarter performance, and we will follow that with a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate our discussion.

Wiehoff","Thank you, Angie, and thanks to everybody who's taken the time to listen into our call. So my prepared comments, as Angie said, will start with Slide 3 on our prepared deck that summarize our overall financial results for the second quarter. The key metrics that we focus on, our total revenues grew 9.2% for the quarter. Net revenues grew 1.8%. I'll discuss more about it later, but in general, that margin compression of net revenues growing slower than total revenues is a common theme throughout all of our different services. Our income from operations grew 2.7%, and our EPS grew at 6%. Chad will make some more comments later about our variable business model and our operating expenses. But in general, we were pleased that we were able to grow our EPS faster than our net revenues.","As in the past, I'm going to make a few prepared comments for each of our individual service lines, but before we move off of the enterprise results, I guess I wanted to touch on what I believe is the common theme for our second quarter results across all of our transportation services. And that really is the theme of: our underlying capacity providers looking pretty aggressively to drive price increases, and at the same time, our customer base that we're working with being as focused as ever on supply chain savings and cost reductions, and not very receptive to meaningful price increases based on overall economic conditions and how they're managing their supply chains more aggressively, which resulted in us across all service lines really, some pretty meaningful margin compression that was pretty systemic for us. It's not a new topic. We've talked about it the last couple of quarters, but it was as anticipated, and we talked about the early days of April on our last call that, that margin compression really continued across all service lines. Again, driven largely, we believe, by the overall environment and macro effects. And as I go through each individual service line, I'll try to comment more specifically on kind of what we're seeing and how we think it might be impacting us. But that's clearly kind of the connecting theme that we would mention.","Moving on then to Page 4 and the overall transportation results. There you see the total net revenues being roughly flat for the quarter. The volume growth in almost all service lines that I'll get into more specifically offset by that net revenue margin compression that I referenced. On the bottom half of that slide, our 10-year or historical net revenue margin percentage shows that for the quarter, we had 14.9% net revenue margin for the quarter in transportation. We've talked a lot in the past about how these margins fluctuate and all the various things that could impact them. And while we expected margin compression off of the highs of 2009 and all of the economic circumstances that created that, I think it's fair to say that this margin compression cycle has been longer and more significant than we might have anticipated. So while it's not uncommon for our business model to see supply cost rising faster during periods of time than we're able to pass through to our customers. Again, this has been a fairly significant and fairly long part of the cycle, down to a 10-year low of 14.9% for the quarter.","Moving on to Page 5 then for our truck results. As a reminder, our truck category includes both truckload and less-than-truckload. Net revenue combined for the 2 declined to 0.5% in the second quarter. We were happy with volume increases of 10% in truckload and 17% in LTL. Again, following the theme of cost pressures on the truckload side, the capacity that we rely heavily on, the medium and small carriers, continue to experience a fair amount of cost pressure. And as we disclosed, our net cost for the quarter were up 3% on the truck load compared to second quarter of last year, with customer prices being up about 1%.","While we've talked in the past and it remains true that we have slightly a higher growth with our larger customers, where we tend to have more dedicated or committed pricing relationships, there was probably some impact to our margin compression based on the changing mix of business and the alignment with those larger customers, as well as some mix change around the length of haul, with that shortening a little bit. So there's probably some contributing factors that were maybe specific to our mix of business and our customer base around the opportunity for price increase versus the supply side on the trucks. But overall, we feel like it's the general environment of price increasing and price pressure on the supply side versus much less receptivity to it on the customer side.","Similarly, when you go into the LTL business, as I'm sure many of you know, general trends of pricing on the supply side upward as they come off of some very difficult economic times from a couple of years ago. So that industry continues to look for some pretty meaningful price increases. And while we were able to pass along a little bit more of the price increases there, it's difficult to come up with a precise percentage because of all of the different tariffs and trying to get a clean comparison. We also did have net revenue margin compression on the LTL side.","Moving then to Slide 6 in our intermodal results. We had a net revenue decline of 7.8% for the quarter. Again, comprised of single-digit volume growth, mid-single-digit, offset by some margin compression. Again, as many of you are probably aware, rails have generally been looking for some pretty meaningful cost increases that have been put towards us in our pricing. And while we've had some success passing those through, again, there was probably some mix shift where we've been working more with larger customers on a more dedicated basis in intermodal. But in general, the theme was that the supply side costs are rising faster than our volume and our price increases to our customers would allow, resulting in some net revenue margin compression. And in this case, a net revenue decline.","The other comment on there that's worth mentioning is we've talked in the past about how we've begun to ramp up with some dedicated or owned container capacity to help us be more effective on those larger commitments in the intermodal world. If you recall in the past, we had 350 short term leased containers, along with 500 owned containers. We recently purchased an additional 500 containers that will take the place of the 350 short term leased ones that we'll be turning in throughout the remainder of the year. So by the end of the year, we should have 1,000 owned containers in place, which is the foundation of a fleet that we're building. Again, it represents a fairly small percentage, somewhere around 15% to 20% of our total intermodal volume at this point. But we believe it's been an effective tool to help us grow our intermodal business.","Moving on then to Page 7 for the air and ocean results. Our results in the global forwarding world are probably a little less representative of overall industry trends, simply because our business there remains smaller with less market share and more concentration in fewer customers and fewer carriers. So some customer-specific changes around growth or mix can have a bigger impact. But in general, on the ocean side, the theme holds true around some meaningful cost increase that resulted in us increasing pricing. In this case, more of a neutral net revenue margin effect, but challenging to grow volume in a difficult industry environment. On the air side, is one area where we do see meaningful price decreases. I think the common theme here is that customers are looking aggressively for lower-cost options and managing the cost in their supply chain more aggressively. So in the business that we see a lot less tendency to ship via more expensive air mode and more shift towards ocean. So while our air volume was able to increase, with significant price decreases in both the industry and with our customer relationships, while our net revenue margin percentage improved, the overall absolute dollars of net revenue declined for the quarter by 7.5%.","Moving on to Page 8. The other logistic services continues to represent one of the bright spots of higher growth for us. As a reminder, these net revenues include our transportation management services and customs brokerage, which are the 2 largest categories. This source of net revenue has increased up to 4.5% of our net revenue for the quarter, and it's representative of the trend towards more outsourced services and growth in transportation management services. So while that customer and overall pricing environment has put some net revenue margin compression on our traditional transportation services, it's that same environment that's creating a lot of demand and pipeline of services for us in this area. Where working with customers more collaboratively, we're finding better opportunities to provide management services in the form of technology and analytical tools that can help our customers achieve the savings in the directional projects that they have in place. So we feel good about our results here, as well as the outlook for higher growth and continued opportunity in this. And as we've stated in previous periods, in addition to the growth in the net revenues of 4.5% of our consolidated net revenues that are represented by this category, there are also a lot of relationship connectivity to the underlying transportation services in those same accounts. So that when we look at a broader definition of outsourced services and integrated solutions, it already exceeds more than 10% of our net revenue.","Moving on to Page 9 and our Sourcing results. Again, another one of the positive highlights for the quarter. We continue to see progress in terms of growing our business and coming up against some of the more normal comparisons as we've talked about some lost business over the last couple of years. Last September, we announced an acquisition of a company called Timco that's primarily focused on the melon business. We had very nice growth during the quarter in that business and are very positive about the future prospects for it. So a more return to more normal comparisons and activity in our traditional Sourcing business, along with an acquisition that we feel good about gave some nice results for the quarter. The margins for the quarter, again, do change and fluctuate in the Sourcing business, similar to transportation. That's primarily driven by the product mix and the seasonality of the different crops that we sell and distribute.","Moving on to Slide 10 and our Payment Services. Again, this represents our wholly-owned subsidiary, T-Chek. Net revenues up 8.1% for the quarter. The net revenue growth was driven by increased transaction in our fuel services, MasterCard and permitting businesses that are all part of the menu of services under T-Chek's Payment Services.","Those are my overall comments on our services. I'm going to turn it over to Chad for some comments on our financial statements. And then I'll come back and close with some thoughts on forward looking and where we go from here.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Thank you, John. Slide 11 shows our summarized income statement, and I'd like to highlight a few things contained in that income statement. As John mentioned, we feel very good and are pleased that we continue to operate very efficiently. Overall, our operating expenses grew slightly slower than our net revenue in the second quarter.","In the second quarter of 2012, while our average headcount increased 9% compared to last year, our personnel expense decreased. That was due to a reduction in some of our incentive compensation and equity compensation programs that are based on growth in earnings. During the quarter, our stock-based compensation expense was approximately $6.8 million in 2012 compared to $10.1 million in the second quarter of 2011.","Growth in other operating expenses was driven by increases in many different categories, including travel and entertainment, claims and depreciation and amortization. While we've been operating extremely efficiently, we've also been continuing our focus on long-term growth of the company. Our people are focused on sales and have been traveling more. We have continued to invest in technology to support our long-term growth and efficiency, which has driven the majority of the increase in depreciation and amortization.","During the quarter, we had a decrease in our provision for doubtful accounts. This was driven partially by a partial collection of the customer that we had a large reserve for last quarter and an overall improvement in the quality and aging of our receivable portfolio. We have continued to follow our consistent methodology for assessing our reserve requirements, and are extremely comfortable with the current level of our accounts receivable reserve.","Moving on to Slide 12. We continue to have a strong balance sheet, with cash and investments of approximately $240 million and no debt. Our net CapEx for the quarter, including the investments in software was $7.5 million. As John mentioned earlier, we have decided to expand our intermodal container fleet. The 500 additional containers that he mentioned will cost a total of approximately $6 million.","$2.8 million of that $6 million is in our second quarter CapEx. The remainder will be paid for in the third quarter.","Previously, we told you we expected our 2012 CapEx to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million. That estimate did not include these containers, so we now expect our CapEx to be more in the range of $46 million to $51 million.","A couple of comments on our share repurchases. As we have always -- as we've discussed with you many times in the past, we use share repurchases as a variable way to return excess capital to shareholders. We continued this practice during the second quarter of 2012. During the second quarter of most years, including this year, investment in working capital increases as our gross revenues seasonally increase. This increase in working capital reduces the amount of money we have available for share repurchases. However, during the second quarter of 2012, we did repurchase approximately 637,000 shares at an average price of $59.23.","And now I'll turn it back to John for some closing prepared comments.","John P. Wiehoff","So looking at the Slide 13, our current period comments and summary. Starting with the data points that we've shared about July. As we look at our business and try to understand what information will be helpful to understand the trends in the business and where we think we're headed. We believe it still remains very difficult to try to forecast or guide given the short-term nature of our procurement cycle and kind of the day-to-day volatility in the business. So we continue to believe that sharing actual information that's more current is probably the best way to kind of share what's on our mind and discuss the trends in the business. We did try to enhance a little bit the net revenue disclosures up to the current period to try to help you with that. So similar to what we've talked about in the past, the North American truckload volume growth through yesterday was 11%. Our net revenue per business day declined by 1.5%. If you look at the data below that, that's showing for the current year through yesterday, July 23, we had approximately $6.7 million net revenue per business day. And that compares with $6.8 million per business day last year for the first 25 days of July. So that's where the 1.5% decline would come from. The additional data point to try to provide a little more context around how the quarter is starting out and how comparisons might shape up. So the net revenue per business day for the entire third quarter last year was $6.6 million per day. So you can see while it started out last year at $6.8 million for the first 25 days in July, the average for the quarter was $6.6 million. This year, starting out at $6.7 million. Last July was our most challenging comparison in terms of the net revenue per business day. One additional data point is that this year's third quarter has 1 fewer business day than last year.","I think while there's a number of data points there, probably the core message is that the net revenue margin compression that I've talked about earlier really has carried over into July. But we also believe that perhaps the comparisons are going to ease a little bit as the second half of the year goes on. Who knows where the market forces will go and whether -- how they'll actually end up comparing. But that's what we know today. So when we step back and look at the business and say, where do we go from here, how do we see things, how are we managing the business today? I guess the first question is, when do we find a bottom on the margin compression cycle? As I mentioned earlier, it's not uncommon that our supply costs would rise faster than we're able to pass them through. But this is a little bit longer and more severe than we've seen. And so there is question around that margin compression and where the bottom of the cycle would be. Traditionally, at least, when we reach that margin stabilization, our earnings growth would generally move back more towards volume percentage type increases. It can obviously fluctuate for various reasons, but that would be kind of the core expectation when we get there. If we can get some margin relief or margin expansion, that obviously will help us a lot in the future. But I would say that our overall perspective in how we're managing the business is hoping for that margin stabilization or improvement, but also managing to the extent that it doesn't occur or that it doesn't occur in the near future, that we are prepared to manage our business and grow our earnings under more difficult margin comparisons.","And when I talk about that, it's things like investing in the sales and account management initiatives that we have to drive market share. We feel pretty good about some of the market share gains in the different services that we've had. And I feel like it is the right strategy to continue to try to take market share. It's challenging to grind out small earnings increases while we're having this sort of margin compression. But we feel like it's the right thing to do, to continue to position the business for the long term and build on those relationships that we have. We're hiring people and investing more in training than we have at any point in our history. We're expanding our service offerings and integrating our services and transforming the business to where customers want more services to help them manage their supply chain more holistically. We're emphasizing heavily our pricing and profitability disciplines. While we're aggressively going after market share, we have the best receivable aging metrics we've had in a long time. Our operating income as a percent of net revenue is at new highs. So we feel very good that we're continuing to have a good discipline around going after market share, but making sure that it's profitable growth. And as we've reminded you on several calls in the past, while margin percentage matters a lot, ultimately, the productivity and the efficiency and the automation that's in the freight can result in operating income that is equally good on less margin freight, if it's more efficient business. So when we go through periods of margin compression like this, it really does drive us to invest in technology and productivity and different processes that we think will continue to benefit us for the long run. So we're spending more on technology this year than we have at any point in our past, and we're very focused on monitoring the turnover and people and productivity initiatives to make sure that our workforce stays motivated and stays focused on evolving with the customers in the marketplace. So as I said earlier, I would summarize our attitude by grinding out small earnings increases while our margins are compressing, hoping for stabilization or relief at some point in a future market cycle and making all the investments that we think are good long-term choices to help us grow our business and be successful even if we don't get that margin help.","Those are the end of the prepared comments. And with that, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of William Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","John, you had a good sort of synopsis there right at the end that makes a lot of sense with a lot of the strategic initiatives you were trying to put in place. One question that comes up though a lot when I have discussions on the name though is, is what can Robinson specifically do to change the growth trajectory now? Right? Like so, I understand that you're making investments and that sets you up for a better outcome later when the macro gets better. But it sounds like every time it comes back to, okay, but the macro if it doesn't improve, there's not much we can do. But I'm not sure that's what you're trying to say. Do you have any thoughts on that? If it can be done outside of macro?","John P. Wiehoff","I think there are some short-term things that we could possibly do to improve our short term earnings. But I don't know that, that would be the right thing to do for the long term. You can always be more aggressive on pricing at the risk of the relationship or we probably could do some cost cutting or some other things that would improve our short term earnings. But I really do think we're staying pretty focused on the long-term investments and while we're spending more on people, and spending more on technology and making investments in containers and a lot of these things, we're opening offices in Europe despite all of the economic uncertainty because we continue to believe that there's a really good long-term opportunity for us there. We're also looking at acquisitions and other things that maybe could help us grow a little bit faster in the shorter term like the Timco acquisition did on the Sourcing piece of it. So it's not that we're not trying to improve it in the short term, but we clearly have a bias towards the longer-term approach.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. No, that's fair. You mentioned the investment in automation. And if I remember correctly, you could correct me if this number is wrong, but I thought about 5% of your loads are sort of tendered and matched electronically. Is there a step function we could get? Could you see sort of this number be 15%, 20%, 25% or so of loads sort of tendered electronically such that we could have a whole step function change in the way we perceive operating margins?","John P. Wiehoff","I'm having trouble remembering what stat that was that's 5%. Because I think our electronic tenders of loads -- tendering in from the customer is probably closer to 30%.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, I thought it was a match, the electronic match, but maybe I've got the number off.","John P. Wiehoff","Oh, the 5% is we have some preexisting in a very limited amount of our capacity when we commit to certain programs with a customer, we'll go out and contractually hire those carriers as well. That type of relationship will probably continue to grow. But it's got a pretty limited application today of where it makes sense. But when you look at things like our LTL automation, a lot of those transactions end up being no touch because we have each carrier's -- each common carrier's rate in our system, and we automatically pick the rate that will meet the service requirement of the customer. So we've been making many different technology enhancements to LTL, to truckload, to try to integrate with more of those customers, try to integrate with our carriers. In addition to the kind of the prepurchased capacity, we also have grown where with some of our truckload carriers that we can tender them a load offer electronically, and they can respond electronically. I'm not quite sure what that percentage is. So there's many different productivity initiatives driven by technology, and a lot of them are electronic interface, EDI and other electronic communication methods. But I don't have any real new stats to give you.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, but I guess it still comes back to the kind of margin improvement that you've seen over like the last 10 years. It's going to be difficult to repeat that even with these productivity initiatives.","John P. Wiehoff","Yes, I mean, we're pretty consistent about saying, we went from under 30 to over 40. We're not going to see that type of expansion -- or we can't see it today at least where that type of expansion would be possible in the future. But as we mentioned in some previous calls, yes, we can get up into the mid-40s, but maybe even higher if we didn't care about growth. I think this business is constantly balancing growth and efficiency.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","John, you mentioned that this is already a longer period of margin compression than you would've expected given experience in past cycles. So I guess with double-digit volume growth not translating to similar types of net revenue, at what point do you actually say, \"Okay, maybe this is the systemic environment from a capacity standpoint where I'm not getting the leverage that I need and I've got to reevaluate the volume versus the price dynamic that we're pushing with our workforce?\"","John P. Wiehoff","I'd like to think we're doing that everyday. When we look at those account management strategies that I emphasized and when I talked about sort of systemic margin compression, that margin compression really is across all the freight, the existing freight, the new freight. So we're very comfortable that this 10% volume increase that we got came at comparable margins to the core business that we had before. And there's even a fair amount of churn within that core business through rebidding and different transportation cycles. So the way we think about the business and the profitability and the elasticity of pricing is looking at account-based profitability around the total margin and the total workload that managing that freight entail, and the labor and cost that we have associated with it. And that is a very fluid, perpetual process that we're adjusting literally daily around pushing back on our customers if we need more automation and more help to be able to keep that freight profitable. We are doing that every day.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I mean, if I think about it in terms of my business, if I have a trader who's taking losses in dealing with customers, that will get stopped out at a certain point. I mean, are you micromanaging it to that point on a regional basis? Where if the customer is running you over too many times, you start pushing back in a very big way?","John P. Wiehoff","Absolutely. And as we've talked about before, every single day, we lose money on some of the loads that we move, but some of them are growth investments, some of them are bundled freight commitments with other good freight. And every office, every zone, every manager is continually looking at the profitability of the freight and trying to reprice or decline freight where they have to honor commitments where we've made. It's a very fluid perpetual thing. And we're not losing on a significantly higher percentage of the loads today than several years ago. It's compression across the board based on the macro environment. But we feel like our day-to-day account management and pricing disciplines are very consistent and very reliable like they've been in the past. It's just that the market is not giving us the same spread that we've had in other periods.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I mean, is it that market is just moving away that much faster and that you guys aren't reacting fast enough? And then I guess in terms of bid season, as we go into the back half of the year, is it maybe just a contractual issue and we're about to get some relief as July 1 brings new pricing across the board with many of your contractual customers?","John P. Wiehoff","No, I think our results are very consistent with every other industry data point we've seen in that the carrier base, especially that we rely very heavily on the medium and small carriers continue to feel a lot of economic pressure. There's a lot of churn. There's no new -- not much new capacity coming into the marketplace. And they're very aggressive looking for price increases because it's still a challenging economic environment for them with a fairly balanced freight environment. Shippers on the other hand are dealing with all the economic uncertainty and looking for cost savings ideas in the supply chain as aggressively as possible. And really, I mean, one of the things that we've discussed a lot the last couple of quarters is that, I think traditionally, a lot of the easy market share gains and high margin freight for the third-party providers like ourselves comes from the growth in the freight. And the unplanned and surge and seasonal freight that's difficult for a shipper to manage. And in this environment, there hasn't been a lot of that. So the market share has come more out of existing customer relationships and making more aggressive price commitments like keeping rates flat to retain or increase your volume when you know you're going to have a couple of percent increases on the supply side. So that's a very typical example of the types of market pressure and squeeze that we're under today. And yet, we know that through more automation that we can be very profitable on that freight. And as market conditions change, hopefully see some margin expansion or improvement as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Albrecht with BB&T.","Thomas S. Albrecht - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Chad, I wanted to get 2 things. What was the amount of the doubtful account collection? And did you have any lower bonus cash accruals? I know you mentioned the stock based and then I have a bigger picture question.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Okay. The specific collection of the specific reserve we talked about last quarter. We collected about 1\/3 of that, which was $600,000. The total bad debt expense for the quarter was actually a negative $1.3 million. The rest of that positive variance came from the improvement of the quality of both the customers in our portfolio on an overall basis, as well as an improvement of the aging in the older buckets where we apply a higher percentage of reserve requirements to the dollars that are outstanding. So we had a couple of significant customers that got -- had improved ratings, both from D&B and some of the credit rating services. So we drove them to the higher quality percentages of reserves, as well as things just getting better and collected quicker in those older buckets of receivables.","Thomas S. Albrecht - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. Cash bonuses.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Oh, and about cash bonuses. Our core bonus program is based on a percentage of earnings of a branch. So some people's cash bonuses went down and some people have gone up depending on the adjustments to their bonus contracts, whether they got more or less point and then how well is their branch performing compared to a year ago. Within the specific incentive-based programs that we talked about that are based on growth in earnings, there's both the restricted stock program, and there's also what we call the growth pool. So if a branch grows above -- the general rule is if a branch grows above 20%, there's an incremental bonus that kicks in. There's far fewer branches that are reaching that additional cash bonus program that we call the growth pool internally.","Thomas S. Albrecht - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then the bigger picture question was, so by year end, the intermodal container fleet will be about 1,000 units. Do you foresee a situation where you're going to need to have this build out over the next 2 or 3 years to perhaps 4,000 or 5,000 containers? I think anytime we hear of a company adding containers, we wonder if you only have density on day 1 when you buy them, and then you need several thousand to consistently have density in the rail yards across the country. So as you look out, will you be able to profitably run this business or are you going to need to have a big ramp of several thousand containers?","John P. Wiehoff","I think we have talked about this before, but the equipment that we have in place today is all committed to the BNSF. And because that fleet today is much more concentrated in fewer lanes in one region of the country, we feel very good about having the density and the execution to be successful with it. The commitment that we've made to date on containers is focused lanes with committed customers, where we can be more successful in managing those relationships. We will expand it if we can continue to gain customer commitments that we can match with it. But one of the things that we've said thus far in our intermodal growth is that we want to try to preserve that container component as a smaller percentage of our capacity needs. So that we can match it with customers and not have that be the driver of our growth. So we're not anticipating any time soon getting to the size fleet where our container purchases or equipment are what's driving our growth and enabling increased capacity. We really want to grow it more selectively in certain lanes and match it to customer-specific commitments. And then use pooled equipment to grow our business and to manage the fluctuations in the volumes.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask you a bit about the compensation trends and just to kind of try to figure out how much they can fall. I guess if I look at the -- you drive compensation, incentive comp by the pace of growth, you had fairly slow earnings growth in the quarter. What would you -- if you stay at that pace for a couple more quarters, would you see in absolute terms that, that personnel expense would fall further? I guess it fell about 3.5% second quarter versus first. Or are you actually kind of close to what would be a threshold level payout that wouldn't fall any further?","Chad M. Lindbloom","It's -- I'm thinking about all the different compensation programs that are out there. But if our growth rate stayed relatively consistent with where it is today and our headcount stayed relatively consistent with where it is today, I'd say that this quarter would be -- that the third quarter could be similar to the second quarter.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So if you had 5% earnings growth in third quarter, it's similar to what you had in the second quarter, and you didn't change headcount, your comp and benefit would be stable, you wouldn't see incentive fall further?","Chad M. Lindbloom","It -- it varies a -- it varies a lot. It would depend on how we got to that consistent revenue growth or consistent earnings growth, depending on which branches grew by how much and which business line grew by how much because there are different varying levels of incentives branch by branch.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. Yes, I know. Just trying to frame a complex thing into a simple, I guess a simple framework, which maybe is tough to do.","Chad M. Lindbloom","We just have so many different programs out there that react differently. But...","John P. Wiehoff","The broader compensation framework is designed to try to keep personnel expense as a consistent percentage of net revenue. But it's really on an annual basis, where a lot of the bonus pools and equity vesting and different things are calculated annually. So from a year-to-year basis, it's easier to make some assumptions about what personnel would do under different circumstances. But from quarter-to-quarter, it's challenging because if the growth rate is accelerating or decelerating, the accruals might be doing the same and it gets tougher to compare to it.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. Okay. Then a second question. It seems like there -- there are some, what appear to be some competitive pressures with more private carriers and then some of the asset-based carriers doing brokerage. I know that's not a new thing this quarter. But it seems like that's been developing, I don't know, past couple of years I suppose. Do you think that shippers have maybe figured out a way to take advantage of that and put more of the pricing risk, manage their rates a bit better and put more of the capacity constraints and pricing risk on the broker? It just seems like the dynamic has kind of changed. And so you see this volume growth, but you just see an unusual rate pressure in between. Do you think that might be the case and you think that type of dynamic might continue just related to more competition in brokerage?","John P. Wiehoff","I think there's a lot of interrelated dynamics, including the one that you just described, and it's really difficult to quantify or assess what impact any of them is having. The big theme that I tried to talk about in the prepared comments is just sort of the collective shipper mindset, which it's probably dangerous to even to try to generalize about that. But when you think about willingness to expedite freight or would you wait another day to ship it if you don't like the price or would you make 3 more phone calls yourself or do you think you got a competitor who's maybe as capable now. There's a whole bunch of different reasons why a shipper may or may not accept a rate increase and competition is one of them. But for the most part, it's the cost pressure and how they're running their business. We think probably the lead variable is how they're thinking about service and inventory, and expedited charges and whether they'll roll the shipment over to the next day or make 3 more phone calls before they'll accept the price. And when you get into an extended period of a balanced market with static route guides and shippers who are trying to keep inventories down and really manage cost down, it just kind of tightens everything up to where there's not a lot of unplanned freight or margin opportunity. And then of course, you've got 10,000-plus competitors like there's always been. And when the market tightens up like that, everybody starts looking for share in each other's pocket rather than kind of the growth in the unplanned opportunities. So yes, it feels like it's a lot feistier and more competitive during that part of the market cycle. I am sure there's some real growth or some real changes in the third-party presence in the market as well too, but when we've been asked about it in the past, our general feeling is, there's nothing radically different or nothing revolutionary in it. It's more competitive because there's not as much growth going on and the environment is different. And that's what we feel kind of the lead variable in that complex web of factors is, including the one that you mentioned.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Wanted to talk just kind of along those lines of market share gains, John, in terms of, I mean, obviously, your volume numbers have picked up pretty nicely and definitely evidence of some market share pickup there. Is that coming from a couple of large wins, things that you've been working on for a while or have you seen any increase in any kind of spot activity or like you said, is it more of just kind of maybe going down the channel and grinding it out a little bit harder than maybe you had been?","John P. Wiehoff","We have seen for the last year or so slightly higher growth rates in our Top 1,000 or Top 2,000 customers, which are generally, the larger companies and generally are larger customers. And we hope and think that's part of this expanding relationship and continued trust and reliance on our model and our service levels and all that. So we are growing and taking share a little bit disproportionate to the larger more committed accounts. And as I've talked on past calls, in general, that comes with a longer term, more committed pricing relationship as well too, which gives us a little bit less short term repricing capabilities. But the growth of share has come across the board and there has been a lot of new customer activity. And we do have more salespeople than ever just looking for accounts of all shapes and sizes.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And just real quick with that, in those longer term committed relationships, are you extending past the typical 1-year timeframe that you historically had done?","John P. Wiehoff","No.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just my second question was, I mean, seeing the nice growth in logistics business, could you kind of remind us again, I mean, I know a lot of that is just kind of pure fee-based in terms of the consulting arrangements. But is that able to drive some additional revenue back to kind of maybe the core truckload business or to other pieces of the business?","John P. Wiehoff","We believe it does. So the largest single source of fee-based income in our management services is the transportation management fees, where shippers are paying us, in essence, technology fees or fees for the utilization of our system to help manage their freight. It is a separate relationship, separate pricing, separate contracting. But when we have a relationship like that with a shipper and are able to see their entire transportation data better and consult with them on supply chain savings or other return on investment type programs, we can oftentimes give more exposure to our transportation capabilities and participate in a bid in a more efficient way and be there to help them solve any transportation needs in a more automated or efficient way. So with those customers where we have those management relationships, our underlying freight activity can expand or contract, and we see some of each, but in aggregate, we feel like it is a net plus and that our freight relationships have grown better where we have a broader, integrated relationship with the customer.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just to follow up there. Do I understand you're locking in the pricing? So should we not expect kind of a re-expansion on that net revenue growth from the -- or net revenue margins from that kind of 14% to 15% range back to the 16% range? Just understanding if you're locking in those long-term rates.","John P. Wiehoff","So I think in more pure transactional business where it's -- the customer is tendering the loads daily or there is not a longer term commitment, we can adjust to the market conditions daily or whenever we see appropriate. With a large lot of the larger accounts, it flows more on an annual bid cycle. Every time it comes up, we can reassess the pricing, and we hope that longer term our margins can improve or increase over time. But that is typically more 3 month, 6 months, at some point in the future where there's the opportunity to address the customer pricing on more of the freight that with those larger customers.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So locking in...","John P. Wiehoff","But the lag time and the delays in repricing to the customer are different than with more transactional freight.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So locking in business in hopes of when the market rolls, you have a chance to reprice it?","John P. Wiehoff","Yes. Building the relationship and improving our connectivity with them, taking market share with that customer, helping them in a more holistic way and then as market conditions change, hopefully, our margins can normalize as well.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So to that point you mentioned, what's gone on in July, the volume is up 11%, but net revenues, 1.5%. Can you flesh that out a little bit? What are you seeing in the dynamics there? What are you -- I'm sorry, and then kind of what we should see, I guess, in a decelerating economy, and you're accelerating that share I guess because of those large customer relationships. I guess, how should we look at that split with the volumes up, but the net revenues declining?","John P. Wiehoff","So the data points midmonth are always a little fluid. I would say that the general message in our July disclosures is that not a lot has changed. Really, if you look at the volume growth and the margins, we've got a little bit more difficult comparison. We have 1 fewer business days, but that in general, we're having significant market share and volume gains. But it's coming at the -- with margin compression. Where it goes from here, it really depends upon what happens starting tomorrow with the collective pricing decisions and psyche of 50,000 carriers and 35,000 shippers and how they respond to economic growth and freight demand and what happens tomorrow.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But Chad to that point, are you seeing that accelerate I guess? I just want to understand what message you're sending with giving that, the to date in July. I know you've done it in the best, but are we seeing that compression accelerate from where you were last quarter?","Chad M. Lindbloom","No, not necessarily. I mean, last quarter, when we give the stats, I think volume was up 10% and net revenue up 1%. So yes, there's a slight acceleration of that, but it's not -- it's really more of the continuation of the same where our carrier prices are rising slightly faster than our prices to our customers.","John P. Wiehoff","And that slight change is probably driven more by comparison differences than any business decisions we've made in the last 23 days.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm sorry, John, can you say that again, because of what?","John P. Wiehoff","That slight change is likely more driven by comparison changes from July of a year ago versus any business decision we've made in the last 23 days around pricing or margins.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So it's not getting more aggressive with the pricing?","John P. Wiehoff","No.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","This is Bascome Majors in for Matt this afternoon. Historically, your business model has worked very well. When the TL capacity tightens and service failures start to become commonplace at primary carriers. I know you briefly alluded to this earlier. But I was hoping you could give us a little more detailed color on sort of where the supply demand balance is today versus -- or even how close you've come to sort of this disruptive environment, which has paid dividends for you in the past?","John P. Wiehoff","Based on the service metrics that we have in both our transportation management business and in our core freight services, we still see the market as fairly balanced. There isn't a lot of service failures. There isn't a lot of depth to the route guide would be the most relevant metric that we would talk about, where customers who have structured programs for how they tender their freight, how deep are they going in their carrier selections. The vast majority of the time, those route guide depths are still less than 1.5, which means the majority of the time, the carrier at the top of the route guide is getting the load based on a balanced market, which is why in our freight services, we would continue to try to position ourselves near the top of the route guide commitments because that's the best place to be in a balanced market to make sure you're getting access to the freight and moving what you can. There's a lot of things that could happen that could change that balance. The continued contraction of supply and the lack of ordering of new equipment will continue to put pressure on that supply side. Any kind of economic growth or change in the shipper side or the freight side of it -- but it needs -- we feel like there needs to be some sort of more meaningful economic transition on either the demand or the supply side to really change the environment that's been out there for more than a couple of years now.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Can you recall a time in the past when you have had a supply side driven disruption that really drove this type of revenue growth at your business?","John P. Wiehoff","Not like this. I think probably the biggest supply -- the truckers could probably answer better. But from our perspective, at least what feels a little bit unique this time is just coming out of that 2009 timeframe with all of the financial crisis that since then, the change in leverage, the access to financing, the lack of new equipment orders, the fear of driver shortages, the regulatory pressures on hours of service and the cost increases from emission rules. You put all that supply side stuff together and it does feel like we've been talking for several years that the dynamics around how and when new capacity will be added and what cost it will be added at is a little bit unique or maybe fairly unique in terms of this type of the cycle.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess first, just to summarize what you've been talking about as it relates to some of the productivity gains on a per employee basis, I'm wondering if you can provide some framework to think about transactions per employee over the course of the past 3 or 4, 5 years a period of time. And then frame it -- kind of thinking about what you think the annual productivity gains on a transaction per employee basis can be over the next similar time period, over the next 3 to 5 years.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Right. We don't have and haven't really disclosed any hard stats on transactions per person and one of the reasons is the transaction is not a transaction. So when you look at the different modes of transportation and services that we provide. For instance, somebody can do probably up to 5x as many LTL shipments as they can do truckloads. So it is -- it takes a lot of detail and a lot of things that we analyze internally. So as far as how many transactions per person are we doing, it really depends on the mode. A lot of the times, even within a mode, if -- there can be people who can do 10 truckloads if the -- if it's consistent freight, it's tendered electronically, they have a consistent carrier following or it can take all day to do 1 load. Hopefully, if it takes all day to do 1 load, we're making 10 times as much money or net revenue on that load as we are on each of the 10 loads. So it really gets a lot more complex than that when looking at net revenue or at transactions per person. We use more net revenue per person and operating income per person and how are we doing at managing those. And then where is the compensation expense as a percentage of net revenue. So when we look -- really look at internal productivity, it's far more driven on net revenue per person than it is on transactions per person. And the ultimate measure is really operating income to net revenue when you look at efficiency in our opinion.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's fair. John, earlier, you had talked about -- you had mentioned Europe as an opportunity. I know that you've got some new leadership over there. You opened an office recently. Are we in front of an accelerated period of expansion or opportunity in that market? Or is this just a natural evolution of developing your service offerings over in that region?","John P. Wiehoff","We've been offering truckload services in Europe for about 20 years, and the growth rate has slowed more recently because of some of the economic strain and slower environment there. But we did just recently relocate one of our executives to Amsterdam to help really lead a greater pace of investment and growth. We're going to open offices a little bit more aggressively, and we feel like, again, over the next 10 or 20 years that there's a really good opportunity to replicate our surface transportation offerings and really grow that business disproportionate to what's happening in the market. That's another example of where we're taking a pretty long-term approach towards it. It's not the greatest environment to really be trying to invest more aggressively and taking market share for reasons that we talked about earlier. But we do feel like our service, our truckload service especially, is working well, and that there's a lot of opportunity for longer term market share gains. And we have ramped up our commitment to it this year.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Peter Nesvold with Jefferies.","Tavio Headley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Tavio Headley in for Peter Nesvold. So what has to happen for yields to move in your favor? Do we need to tip into a loose market?","John P. Wiehoff","I think I kind of mentioned earlier that there's a couple of things that could happen, but it's some combination of movement on either the supply or the demand side, and that could either be the continued contraction of capacity and more severe shortages that really start to cause shippers to take a different attitude towards expedited or incremental freight charges or it could be new supply coming in that changes the dynamics and loosens the market, as you suggest. The more likely thing in the short term historically at least has been more aggressive change on the freight demand side. That's an easier needle to move in the short term just in terms of some sort of peak season or accelerated freight demand that would cause a change in that balanced market condition that we've had for a few years.","Angela K.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, April 27, 2016.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, the Director of Investor Relations.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, Rachelle, and good morning, everybody. On our call this morning will be John Wiehoff, the Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Clarke, our Chief Financial Officer. John and Andy will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our first quarter and we'll follow that with a response to the pre-submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday.","Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate the discussions. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Andy will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments. I'd like to remind you that comments made by John, Andy or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from managements' expectations.","With that, I'll turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments on slide three with a review of our first quarter results.","John Wiehoff","Okay. Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking the time to listen to our Q1 call. I want to start my prepared comments by talking a little bit about Freightquote. As you may recall, that acquisition was completed on January 1 of 2015, so last year during our quarterly earnings calls we were continuously highlighting the impact of Freightquote and making certain that the impact of that material acquisition was understood.","As of January 1 of 2016, we've lapped a full year comparison of Freightquote so the results and the schedules that we'll be walking through today represent purely organic growth and comparisons year-over-year that include Freightquote.","Again, as you may recall, our plan is that we're managing Freightquote as a separate brand within the C.H. Robinson LTL business so that we will continue to reference Freightquote and Freightquote results, but they are included in our overall LTL performance.","When Andy gets to that, you'll also see that our overall LTL performance has been good and that one of the things that we do pride ourselves in and try to stay focused on is when we complete acquisitions like that that both our legacy business as well as the new business improves and continues to grow at an acceptable rate. So we continue to feel very positive about the Freightquote acquisition. It'll get a little less visibility just because the lapping of the year, but we feel very positive about that investment and now incorporating it into our LTL business.","So with that, back to slide three and looking at our overall results for Q1 of 2016, our total revenues declined to 6.9% to just a little over $3 billion. The headlines and the total revenues are the decline in fuel prices as well as the decline in the pricing of most of our services, which we'll walk through by area.","Total net revenues for the quarter increased 7.3%. The story there is while there were price decreases we did have volume increases in most of our services as well as margin expansion, which we'll talk quite a bit about.","Income from operations for the quarter: $198.9 million or an increase of 9.4% over last year. You can see down below in the metrics our average head count for the quarter increased 5.5% over the year as well, too. When we think about our business from a headline standpoint, we are investing in talent but we also feel very good about the productivity levels and the efficiency levels that we're operating at. We also had very good expense management in the quarter that Andy will talk through as well, too. So you see income from operations growing faster than net revenue, which is our hope.","From an earnings per share standpoint, $0.83 for the quarter compared to $0.73 last year or a 13.7% increase and that also goes with the weighted average shares below that to a decrease of 2% or 143 million shares outstanding.","As has been our plan for a while, we continue to invest in share repurchases and capital management strategies that have helped us achieve our plan of growing our EPS slightly faster than our net income or income from operations, which did happen again in this quarter.","So those are kind of the headline financial metrics for the quarter overall. We feel very good about them. Our business continues to perform very well and our team is engaged and doing a great job across our network. So that's a positive thing and we feel very good about the overall results.","In terms of I guess the other headline before I turn it over to Andy, obviously, you'll see and had a lot of discussion over the past few quarters that we are now two years or eight consecutive quarters into overall transportation margin expansion. We'll try to help you understand kind of by area where that's happening and what our thoughts are. Again, it gets very difficult to predict the market conditions and where those things might go, but we definitely have had a nice run of margin expansion and favorable margin conditions where that has helped our net revenue growth and our results.","As we've talked for decades, we view it as our primary job to really help our customers and carrier partners understand the market conditions and manage through those cycles with the right level of execution and service performance, and we continue to feel very good about how we're positioned with that. So those are the overall financial metrics and headline messages that I would share with you.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Andy to walk through our results by service area.","Andrew Clarke","Thank you, John, and thank you all for listening in. Before I get into the detailed results, I would like to follow-up on John's comments and commend the Robinson team. Our network continues to perform at a high level serving both customers and suppliers. The great results are what happens when talented people work together.","In 2016, we've had many customer awards recognizing our performance as a top logistics provider to prominent companies like Wal-Mart, Coke, Dollar General, Ocean Spray, Home Shopping Network and Brose North America. These awards are a great example of how our team is adding value with the customers.","The macro environment remains sluggish. Despite that, we were able to grow our volumes in nearly all services in the first quarter. We will maintain our focus on profitably taking market share in this softer environment. The market conditions in the second quarter remained pretty consistent with what we saw in the first quarter.","And now on to slide four and our transportation results. Transportation net revenue increased 7.9% to $534 million in the quarter. The drivers for this increase were truckload, less-than-truckload, global forwarding and managed services. First quarter transportation net revenue margin increased 290 basis points to 19.7%. The breakout of the various factors for this change in margin were fuel, which represented an approximate 90 basis point impact; lower purchased transportation cost in truckload represented approximately 130 basis points; and the impact of higher-margin businesses in global forwarding and managed services represented the remaining increase.","The first quarter is continued evidence of the cyclicality of our industry. The market has had some swings in purchased transportation costs and customer pricing over the past couple of years and, while it is always difficult to predict what lies ahead, we know that the comparisons from last year get more challenging as the year goes on.","To our truckload results on slide five, we had another good quarter in our truckload business, growing net revenues 7.8% and North American truckload volume increasing 4% in the quarter. In North America, the line haul price per mile to our customers, excluding the impact of fuel, was down 5% on a year-over-year basis, while the cost paid to carriers decreased approximately 7%. Similar to the fourth quarter, we continued to see weak spot market pricing when compared to the first quarter of 2015. For the last three quarters, the price to shippers and the price to carriers has been down on a year-over-year basis.","Our volume growth in the quarter came from our contractual business, which was up double digits. However, as you would expect, transactional volume was down double digits on a year-over-year basis. The spot market environment was tepid in the latter part of March and that trend has continued during the first few weeks of April.","We have received a lot of questions from investors about bid activity. Our bid activity increased on a year-over-year basis in both the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as the first quarter of 2016. We have seen that bid activity normalize here in the second quarter, and we expect that we will see a more typical cadence for the remainder of the year. It is difficult to quantify the year-over-year variance in the bid outcomes, but we believe that the results of our recent bid awards has pricing flat to down slightly versus last year's pricing in our contractual awards.","Our Carrier Services team and people in the network had another great quarter, adding new carriers to C.H. Robinson. We added over 2,600 new carriers in the first quarter and those carriers moved approximately 17,000 loads. We also continue to see big increases in our connectivity with these carrier base as we surpassed 50% in automated updates with carriers for the first time during the quarter.","Moving to slide six and the less-than-truckload results, as John mentioned, we continue to be very happy with the results in our less-than-truckload business, with net revenues increasing 6.9% and volumes increasing 10%. The LTL business continues to perform well and the addition of Freightquote is helping us win more often in the smaller shipper segment.","Customer pricing remained flat in the quarter and the results of bid pricing in our contractual business is a bit stronger than in the truckload segment, as we are seeing low-single-digit increases in contractual bid responses. We continue to build on our industry-leading position as the largest third-party provider of LTL services in North America and that value proposition is winning across all verticals.","Transitioning to our intermodal slide results on page seven, intermodal net revenue increased \u2013 decreased, pardon me, 11.9% in the first quarter with volumes down 13%. Results have been challenging for the past several quarters as market conditions have lessened the demand for rail services amongst our customer portfolio. We had approximately 2,000 customers in our intermodal business in this year's first quarter as compared to nearly 2,500 last year. Most of these lost customers were transactional shippers, as our business with our larger customers remained steady.","Transitioning to slide eight, we had a strong first quarter in the global forwarding business. Net revenue increased 8.3% for the combined services. Ocean net revenues increased 16.9% with volumes increasing approximately 8%. Air net revenues declined 10.8% as a result of significantly lower pricing versus last year's first quarter. However, we had strong volume growth in air with a 13% increase in our shipment count. Customs net revenue increased 4.5% in the quarter.","We continue to see good results from our cross-selling efforts between global forwarding and surface transportation services and are seeing an increasing number of opportunities to leverage our full portfolio to assist our customers with their global supply chains.","We have talked a lot over the past couple of years about the successful integration of Phoenix International and the strength of our larger business. We are operating in one global system, allowing us to focus on growth and efficiency. All global forwarding regions and services are now profitable, and we continue to be recognized by our customers for our services. Our Global Forwarding team is well positioned to continue to build on these great results.","Moving on to other logistic services on slide nine. The services in this group include transportation management services, warehousing, parcel and small package. Net revenues increased 21.4% in the first quarter of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. Managed services, primarily our TMS offering, branded TMC, performed extremely well with strong net revenue growth being the primary driver of the first quarter increase. In the first quarter, we implemented the North American phase of the TMC global control tower from Microsoft. We have already implemented in Vietnam, China, Brazil, Europe and Latin America. Our technology platform will support all of their modes of transport for all regions around the world. The Managed Services pipeline continues to expand rapidly, and we expect this service to continue to grow nicely throughout the year.","Transitioning to our sourcing business on slide 10, our sourcing net revenues decreased 2.3% in the first quarter, while case volume grew 8.4%. The decrease in our sourcing net revenues was primarily driven by the adverse effects of heavy rains in Florida, impacting the vegetable crops, which is a high volume and key category for us. This is a category where a high percentage of our business is contracted, and we had to source produce from the West Coast to offset the lost crops, and we had a much higher cost of goods for that West Coast product. We don't expect this issue to carry forward into the second quarter.","So that's a look at the performance in our various services for the quarter, I will now transition to slide 11 and our summarized income statement. Income from operations increased 9.4% in the first quarter and as a percent of net revenues was 35.3%, up 70 basis points from last year's first quarter. For the seventh quarter in a row, we've been able to grow net revenue in excess of expenses.","Personnel expenses were up 8.8% in the quarter. The increase in personnel expenses was driven primarily by a 5.6% increase in head count and an additional payroll tax expense in the first quarter of 2016 of approximately $2.6 million. This expense is related to the delivery of previously vested restricted equity awards and is a one-time event for the year. A good portion of our personnel expenses continue to be variable based on the financial performance of our businesses.","Other SG&A expense decreased 1.3%. This decrease was driven by a lower provision for bad debt as a result of lower receivables in the first quarter of 2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in travel expenses.","Moving to slide 12 and other financial information, we had another very strong cash flow quarter, generating just over $104 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $17.8 million in the first quarter. This increase compared to last year as a result of costs associated with the building of our second data center. We expect capital expenditures for 2016 to be between $60 million and $80 million, with the majority of that going to the data center and technology. We finished the quarter with $970 million in debt and just under $180 million in cash.","And finally, before turning it back to John, on slide 13 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $117 million to shareholders in the quarter, with approximately $64 million coming in the form of dividends, approximately $21 million coming in the form of share repurchases, and we also had shares withheld upon delivery of previously vested restricted equity that totaled approximately $32 million.","Again, thank you to everyone at Robinson for a solid first quarter and thank you all as well for listening in. With that, I'll turn it back to John to make some closing comments.","John Wiehoff","Okay. With regards to wrap-up comments on slide 14, you can see our bullet points there and kind of sticking to form on past calls, what we want to do is just really share what we're seeing currently in the marketplace as well as where we're investing and what's on our minds with regards to our company and how we're approaching the marketplace.","The first bullet point, our April-to-date total company net revenue growth rate per day is approximately 6% when compared to April last year. Andy commented that the end of March or in April we continued to see some softening in demand in the marketplace, and you see that in our overall net revenue growth in April that the demand in the marketplace remains fairly soft. The North American truckload volume growth thus far in April is around 2% compared to the 4% in the first quarter of 2016.","With regards to the second bullet point, again, I've already mentioned the contractual bid activity. It's normal activity for us that in the fourth quarter and first quarter of any typical year that we would see some elevated level of activity. As Andy mentioned, that activity was more robust than normal. It would be very expected in a softening market the price declines that we referenced that you would see increased bid activity by shippers. That's normal behavior in a softening market. We do believe the lion's share of that has passed and that bid activity is at more normal seasonal levels when we come into the second quarter of 2016.","Kind of tying into that bullet point three, the North American truck market continues to have a high level of available capacity. We have \u2013 currently continue to see a soft market with a lot of available truckload capacity and that's the continuation of the business trends that Andy described with pricing moving down and the cost of hire decreasing with that.","So that's what we're seeing from a current marketplace standpoint. There's a few more questions that we'll get into that will expand on some of that. But before we jump to the Q&A session, I would like to just talk about strategy update and our investment priorities that we continue to focus on at Robinson.","People, process and technology is the phrase and the line that we've used for many decades around how we think about our business and just want to reiterate that we continue to think that is absolutely what drives the competitive advantage and success of our business. From a people standpoint, as I mentioned in the opening comments, we are hiring, we are continuing to invest in our network, and we continue to believe that our team of people at Robinson is a very important competitive advantage and will be our number one priority.","From a process standpoint, we have a lot of initiatives across the company around business process improvement, network transformation, how we share freight, how we consolidate, deconsolidate, a lot of those things are supporting some of the growth numbers that Andy walked us through, and that will continue to be part of our approach to innovation and how we look at improving things for both our shipper and carrier partners and how we're working in the marketplace.","Technology, our Navisphere technology platform, that one global instance of how we go to market and how we provide our services and integrate them where appropriate, again, continues to be something that we believe is a competitive advantage and that we're spending significant amounts of money to continue to enhance. There's some questions that get a little more specific around where we're investing in the technology area and what we're doing, so I won't go into that now, but again, just important to understand that that approach to being an asset-free, high-return-on-invested capital, people, process and technology-focused business is as alive as it has ever been at Robinson, and we believe it's working and will continue to drive our success in the future.","Bullet point two, expanding and optimizing our global network. While we're proud of our global footprint and it's changing every day, we also acknowledge that it's a significant growth opportunity for us to expand in parts of the world where we don't currently have a presence in our network today. We do have plans to open offices in Europe and Asia that will expand our geographic footprint. There are other parts of the world where we don't have a presence and work through agents that we think we can continue to grow, as well as optimizing. When we talk about expanding and optimizing, it's hitting on both the growth and efficiency part of how we think about our network that, as proud as we are on how we can execute, we have a long list of opportunities that we think we can optimize our global network and continue to improve the outcomes for our business partners as well as our results. So expanding and optimizing our global network continues to be a strategic imperative that we think has a lot of upside in it to continue to both grow our business and make it more effective.","And lastly, select M&A opportunities. You've heard us talk before about our plan and our approach to the marketplace is to aggressively look at M&A opportunities, but to have what we consider a very high filter in terms of the business model fit and the cultural compatibility of the types of organizations that we want to add to the Robinson network. We're carrying on with that approach, and we continue to feel that we will be able to add value in the future by finding the right selective M&A deals that come to us with the right level of compatibility and fit into our network.","So those are the sort of top-of-mind thoughts around the strategic imperatives that we're working on and what we're seeing currently in the marketplace to wrap things up. So I'll finish there with just one more time reiterating that we're very happy with the results. We're happy with the execution of the team, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the earnings call.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. And before we get started, I'd just like to thank the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit great questions. We'll do our best to get to as many of the topics as we can. I'll frame up the questions as they were submitted and turn it over to John and Andy for their response.","With that, I'll get right into it here.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Timothy Gagnon","And the first question is for Andy. Could you explain the comment in your presentation, contractual bid activity has normalized in the early part of the second quarter?","Andrew Clarke","Yeah, certainly in the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as the first quarter of this year, we experienced an increase in the number of bids in which we participated. In Q1, for example, that bid rate was nearly double what we had seen in the previous year's first quarter. In the second quarter, it's returned to normalcy. So we're obviously participating in more bids on a year-over-year basis as our people out or selling and taking market share. So it's not that the bids \u2013 we're continuing to grow the amount, it's just the rate in which they had increased in the \u2013 versus the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year is more normalized to a normal rate of increase.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, Andy. Next question for John. Given your visibility across both domestic and international freight brokerage markets, would you describe one channel's bid activity to be more aggressive or intense than the other?","John Wiehoff","As we commented earlier with declining prices, it's a normal response that shippers would be a little more aggressive in their bid activity, and so we do see elevated levels from our standpoint across virtually all of our services. I would say that the elevated activity in the North America truckload space is slightly more significant or intense than what we see in some of the other services, with LTL and global forwarding being, again, elevated because of price declines and market opportunities that it would make sense for shippers to elevate those activities. But North American truckload, given our market position and significance, is where we saw the biggest increase.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, John. Next question for Andy. What is your expected tax rate for the full year?","Andrew Clarke","We expect our tax rate to be between 37.5% and 38% for the year. In the past, that rate has fluctuated for various reasons and to a certain degree that will continue, although it will be at a lower level going forward than in the past. During the first quarter of this year, the company made an APB 23 assertion and, as a result, any earnings outside the U.S. incur local country taxes, but unless and until the earnings are repatriated to the U.S., we won't pay the U.S. tax rate on that.","The good news is our operations outside the United States have and continue to perform well, and we want to thank our more than 2,800 international employees for their hard work and efforts.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Your business seems to be more contractual than it was five or 10 years ago, back when you had more transactional business. It seems you could do well in all types of market cycles. Can you talk about how the North America business reacts to different types of markets now that you have a much higher share of contract business?","John Wiehoff","I think this is a really important question in terms of understanding how our business has evolved over time and how it may likely perform in future marketplaces or cycles. As most of you who are familiar with us know, that if you go back a decade or more into the past that we were very focused on transactional brokerage services and approaching the market with very fluid activity around changing prices and changing volume activity in the marketplace.","Over the last decade-plus, it's been longer than that, but for sure in the last decade, one of the longer-term trends in our business is a much greater concentration of committed or contractual freight commitments with our customers. We've talked in the past about each customer's contracting process and the definition of committed freight, contracted freight, awarded freight, a lot of the terminology that you would use to display the success of results in those bids. The challenge in it is that there's variances and nuances to all of them. I think it is useful to aggregate the concept and talk about our universe of contracted freight, and it clearly has increased over the last decade, where going from being a small percentage of our business more than a decade ago to today, the best that we can quantify it is somewhere north of 50%, probably closer to 60% or 65% of our activity that we're moving in Q1 of 2016 was under some sort of a contracted price arrangement or bid result that we've worked with our large shippers.","It is true that in the past, along the lines of the question, that we worried a little bit less about what was happening in the freight cycles and the expansion and contraction of the pricing because in a more transactional world, we could just plan on aggressively selling and taking market share to get that transactional freight and kind of grow through all cycles. As we have become more concentrated in committed and contracted freight and as we've become a much larger entity with $13 billion of revenue rather than $1 billion or $2 billion of revenue, mixing that in with the changing market conditions where we have an economy that's less robust and shippers who are managing their supply chains a lot different than they maybe were a decade ago with regards to their tolerance for expedited charges or transactional premiums and probably managing their inventories much more aggressively today than they were a decade-plus ago, and then mixing in just the impact of technology in the competitive landscape, yeah, there is a difference, I think, in terms of how Robinson will perform in different cycles.","There were a lot of questions around what happens when the market starts to tighten and our contractual commitments potentially create more margin pressure for us when the cost of hire starts to increase and it can take a while to pass through those contractual commitments. In the current environment, what that would mean is that we have a higher percentage, a higher concentration of committed relationships that we're going to have to work through and reprice, and there could be some delay with that. And at times the transactional market just hasn't been as robust as it has in the past. So who knows? Each market seems to be a little bit unique and a little bit different. And like I said, there's a million little nuances and variances around each of these relationships. But I do think as you think forward and analyze our results that is an important part of understanding our go to market and our current mix of business and how those results might happen.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, John. Next question for Andy. Head count was plus 5.5% year-over-year in the first quarter, how are you expecting this metric to trend as you move throughout 2016? Do you continue to expect net revenue growth to outpace operating expense growth in 2016?","Andrew Clarke","Yeah, as John mentioned in his remarks, we have and will continue to invest in talent at Robinson. It's core to who we are and what we do. I would expect the head count rate of growth to somewhat moderate as we go through the remainder of the year. But we talk a lot about people, process, technology, and I'll cite a very specific example of why we've invested \u2013 have and continue to invest in talented people. So we mentioned Microsoft and our ability to manage their global supply chain. So it requires a state-of-the-art global technology platform, which we've made a lot of great investments in, and we continue to hire IT people to not only program that but enhance that. And then you take and marry that up with really talented logistics professionals, not just based here in North America but based throughout the world that are managing one of the largest technology's global supply chain.","And so like maybe also to answer another question around the urbanization, all the technology that goes into that, you have a technology company that is very clearly saying that we value your technology, but we also value the talent and the people that you have in the processes that you run to help us manage our global supply chain across all modes, across all regions.","As to \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, for seven quarters in a row we've been able to grow net revenue in excess of our operating expenses. And clearly a portion of that is driven by the fact that our compensation, personnel expenses, there's a good portion of that that's variable. So we're rewarded on a variable basis for the performance of the business. So I would excite it doesn't always work out that way, but all of us are focused, every person in this company is focused on growing net revenues in excess of operating expenses.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, Andy. Next question for John. We appreciate the commentary around April net revenue growth year-over-year on a daily basis. Can you remind us what your monthly net revenue growth per day was organically in 2015?","John Wiehoff","So as you look back at last year's information, remember that Freightquote activity was included in that. So I believe we talked about total company net revenue growth of 7% and then followed on with kind of mid-double digits, more 15% growth for May and June as the quarter wore on. Taking out the estimated impacts of Freightquote, it was something more like flattish in the early part of April and then kind of the 7% to 8% range for the rest of the quarter. So you can look at that two ways, I guess, in terms of last April on an organic basis being an easier comparison or you can look at it as last year, April started out weak and May and June improved quite a bit as well, too. It gets challenging. We think \u2013 we want to share what we know and we want to share what's in our mind, but in a mid-month like this when you have Easter variables and a lot of normalization and a lot of different market things in there, it's tough to read too much into that, but for now at least we do know that the market is soft and April started off slow.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, John. Next question for Andy. The ocean forwarding business seemed to have a strong quarter, especially given the difficult year-over-year comparisons from the West Coast port congestion and the challenging global ocean freight market dynamics. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the market from a rate and volume standpoint? And have you experienced any customer pushback on rates, given the depressed underlying market rate?","Andrew Clarke","Yeah, absolutely. The Global Forwarding team is doing a great job. We talk a lot about the success of the Phoenix acquisition and how deliberate and thoughtful we've been over the last three years on working on the integration. We're on one platform, one system. We're able to give the customers that visibility throughout the entire supply chain. So we're really happy, and we think the results support what we've been doing.","We continue to aggressively grow volume and margin, particularly with new customer wins, and that's flat-out taking market share because our business with our existing customers is flat. Some of that new customer wins are the result of cross-selling. We talk a lot about that, talk a lot about the success of global forwarding to surface transportation and service transportation to global forwarding. So we're really pleased with the work that we're doing there, but part of it is also just the Global Forwarding team going out and sourcing new business across the globe.","So yeah, it has been a very challenging pricing environment in the ocean side, quite frankly as well as the air. But the team is highly motivated, highly energized and being very successful in going out there and growing the business. And to the question around: are we needing to \u2013 yeah, the fact of the matter is rates are down so \u2013 and they're volatile. So we're quoting rates to remain competitive in that marketplace.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. The other logistics segment continues to expand. Do you see shippers' desire for help in managing more complex supply chains sustainable? How does this revenue stream help your other areas of the business?","John Wiehoff","As Andy commented earlier, we definitely see a sustainable opportunity to continue to grow those services and expand our presence with them in the marketplace. It's one of the areas of the business that we're very excited about. The pipeline looks very good and we think we have a lot of upside there. The customer contracts and relationships are also longer term than in the freight business, so that gives us kind of greater assurance, too, that it's sustainable from that standpoint.","It's a good add-on to ask how this revenue stream helps the other areas of the business because to some degree a lot of those services are premised around independence, that we are creating firewalls and separating information and providing a lot of those other logistic services with complete independence from any provider, including the Robinson freight networks. However, when you think about Robinson expanding its relationships and services around more complex supply chain perspectives, it's important from a number of reasons. One, our technology solution really encompasses the capabilities to do a lot of things. So it just, it really helps broaden our minds and our cultural \u2013 our capabilities around execution.","Beyond that, there's a very important cultural thing, too, that when you strengthen your relationships and your trust level with customers and you understand their supply chain challenges and are able to look at their business more holistically, it absolutely helps you be a more intelligent provider and helps you to bid more intelligently on independent opportunities. An example being if a customer has significant inventory management initiatives and we're working with them from a supply chain standpoint to really better understand their movements and their inventory levels, we also know that on the freight side there probably are opportunities around consolidation and deconsolidation that while separately priced and executed are an important part of achieving some of those strategies.","So it's part of a cultural thing of expanding our mindset, expanding our account manager's capabilities, expanding our technology platform and from a go-to market standpoint, very often the services are very independent in terms of how they're priced and achieved.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. The LTL segment continues to do well. What is behind the strength? Is it sustainable? Does this play into areas of consolidation\/deconsolidation that would benefit from e-commerce?","Andrew Clarke","Yeah, here's another part of our business that continues to just do a wonderful job. We're the number one LTL 3PL and have been so for quite some time. So the short answer is yeah. It has been and will continue to be \u2013 we believe it's sustainable. We've talked often that our non-asset-based strategy benefits both the carriers and the customers and, much like my previous comments on global forwarding, we believe that our results validate our strategy. John had talked about the addition of the freight quote team of \u2013 it's been great. They have tremendous talent down there and while their primary focus is a small and micro shipper, that team has the ability to scale and serve any customer of any size.","So we think being the number one 3PL, being on asset base validates the strategy because it benefits both carriers and it benefits the shippers. We \u2013 that e-commerce phase is growing obviously at a very rapid pace and we're participating in it and we're helping our customers consolidate their freight. We're helping them move it in and out of LTL networks, so we think that we can help them and we're going to benefit from it.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, Andy. Next question for John. From 2002 through last year, your transportation net margin has shrunk on average 127 basis points from Q1 to Q2, although it rose in Q2 2014 and 2015. Would you expect the transport gross margin to contract 90 to 125 basis points or some range of contraction?","John Wiehoff","It's very useful to look at the historic margins and trends and try to learn from them. It gets more and more dangerous to try to describe what's normal or typical or expect to happen. From a long-term perspective, a typical pattern in our transportation business was that years would begin in January and February with a lot less demand and greater margins in the marketplace and then as the spring season would come, particularly with our concentration in produce and a lot of activity ramping up, that we often talked in the past about how it would be normal that margins would compress a little bit moving into the spring and comparing to kind of softer January\/February seasons.","Over the past several years, there's been a lot of change in the marketplace that we've talked about. A lot of change in the mix of our business around the length of haul, changes in fuel prices, some of the things that Andy highlighted that can have a pretty important impact on those margins. And then add to that some of the weather impacts that we've seen over the last couple of years where there's been a pretty material movement on the market. So it's all that that kind of makes us nervous to kind of forecast or guide to where we think margins are going to go. But there is an element of the freight that does have some kind of normal downward pressure on it from Q1 to Q2 just around seasonality.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, John. Next question for Andy about M&A. How would you characterize the M&A environment recently? Has the valuation volatility among public companies slowed the market down at all? Can you share with us which geographic or modal market is providing the most attractive opportunities currently?","Andrew Clarke","Yeah, let me start off by just reiterating what we've stated and, quite frankly, what we've executed on in the past which is we look to deploy capital in ways that create long-term and sustainable shareholder value. The filters we use to evaluate deals are pretty rigorous and, as a result, we end up passing on a pretty high percentage of them. The areas that we look to continue to invest in are ones where we think combining companies and cultures makes sense: global forwarding, Europe, managed services, all present interesting opportunities. But let's not forget about the opportunities that are available in North American service transportation. So yeah, we're looking at all those areas. We have a particular focus. But really, our filters that we deploy are pretty rigorous.","And I guess I would follow-up and use John's words to describe the M&A environment, which is it's selective. And we think that it actually mirrors kind of our philosophy that there are still good buyers, there are still quality buyers and sellers out there, but both are being more selective. And maybe that's a result of recent market discipline among companies that have been making acquisitions and making sure. I think the market is saying let's make sure you have the right strategy and are able to effectively integrate those deals. And clearly, if you look at what we've done since 2012 with both Phoenix, with Freightquote and the like, we've had a pretty successful track record of doing that.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, Andy. The next question for John on the intermodal business. What are your growth expectations relative to the market overall on the intermodal side? Is there anything company-specific that you are doing to help drive growth and\/or net margin in that segment after a few challenging quarters?","John Wiehoff","To understand our growth expectations and our view on our intermodal business, it's important to go back to what Andy talked about that we have historically and still today in intermodal are largely a transactional provider, much like we were a while back on the truckload side of it. Our focus, as we've often talked about, is with the multi-modal shipper where freight moves between truck and rail opportunities. And our primary go-to-market strategy has been to make sure that those customers that want to and are able to take advantage of intermodal savings and service offerings that we're exposing that to them and making sure that our customers are getting the benefit of a multi-modal approach.","We feel like we're very good at that and we've executed on it well over the years and have become a very significant transactional intermodal provider in the network. We work with our rail partners to adjust to the market conditions and help them go after market share when they want to do that. And we sacrifice market share when pricing and market conditions dictate that it should go back the other way. So we feel good about kind of that core offering that we've been doing for several decades.","The limitation with that obviously is that a high percentage of the intermodal freight that moves on the rails is more committed or more contractual freight, and we've acknowledged in the past that we are sub-scale on some of that and without our own dedicated asset commitments and contractual pricing for some of the line haul services, there are situations where we're not competitive on some of the more committed or contractual activities.","We have been for several years and we will continue going forward to try to strengthen our presence in committed or contracted relationships by investing in limited amounts of assets where that's appropriate, by partnering with our rails to make sure that they understand and want the types of opportunities that we're bringing to them, and by continuing to enhance our Navisphere system to make sure that it provides value to shippers and that we can continue very high service levels regardless of what type of intermodal freight we're working on.","So we do have plans to continue to diversify our presence in intermodal. We are open to investments or acquisitions, as we've said many times in the past. But it sort of comes down from the standpoint of if we're going to experience these ups and downs in our growth rate as long as we're primarily a transactional provider, and we do need to continue to focus on a broader presence with more committed relationships. We had a little bit of success with that the last few years. You don't see it over the last couple of quarters because of the significant changes in the transactional marketplace, but we do have some optimism about what we think we can achieve in the future there.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, John. Next question for Andy. In order to drive the long-term growth profile of the company, it seems other service offerings would have to grow faster at a sustainable rate. What is the opportunity to sustain some of the recent wins in international freight forwarding or expand the service to Europe? Are there other service areas that might be underappreciated today, regarding their potential growth profile over the next five years?","Andrew Clarke","Yeah, first let me just say that we're really pleased with the long-term growth profile of all of our businesses. We think we're playing in the right spaces to take advantage of trade, both global and local and outsourcing. But second, let me say that the leadership teams that we have in each of these areas are exceptional. They and their people do a great job of serving existing customers and winning new business. Yeah, I mean, the short answer is we can sustain this. I mean, the Global Forwarding team has continued to show growth. We're pleased with the work that \u2013 and I'll get into it a little bit, the managed services, so these wins, we believe, are sustainable.","As far as areas that are underappreciated, I would have to say one, our growing international presence. I mentioned that over 2,800 people that we have based outside of the United States, with particular note towards the teams in Europe, Asia, Mexico are just doing a great job. And finally, as I alluded to with the Microsoft example, our managed services business. TMC has been growing at double digits for some time and their new customer wins and committed pipeline is actually quite impressive. You talk about the world\u2019s largest \u2013 one of the world's largest technology companies selects your people, your process, your technology to manage the global supply chain. I think it's a statement of the power of that business. And we think you look out over the next five years, we're pleased with all of the businesses. We're pleased with our North American service Trans. We think obviously it's a big and expanding market.","The work that we're doing in Europe is going to show a lot more. Asia, Mexico, Central America, South America as well as our managed services business are all going to be a little more highlighted as well as global forwarding.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, Andy. Next question for John on ELDs. You mentioned on the last call that shippers realize that regulations such as ELDs that'll drive up the transportation costs later in the year. Do you still think that's the case, or has the loose capacity, tepid demand environment pushed the expected rate increases into 2017, at least as it relates to ELDs?","John Wiehoff","So what we've talked about in the past is the fact that over the last six or seven years there's been a variety of regulatory changes around safety requirements, hours of service and ELDs sort of being the latest regulation coming through that either limits the productivity or the available capacity or in this case, particularly, drives some cost increase in terms of the cost to serve or cost to execution on the supply side. It has been our view and remains our view that over time all those costs pass through and will normalize and that it's not something that we necessarily fear or think is going to create any sort of permanent material shifts in the landscape of who's competitive or what happens.","It does, however, add some pressure around how and when those costs get added, who adds them when, and exactly how and when they get put into the rates. So when you combine the sort of normal capitalistic churn of supply and demand and the fact that carriers are always kind of coming and going in a very fragmented marketplace, yeah, probably the soft market probably adds some pressure to how and when people recover the incremental costs that ELDs will drive over time. And the fact that some carriers have had them for a while and others need to add them, it certainly can \u2013 there's some dynamic there that's probably real. But from our standpoint, with each of these cost drivers and regulatory type changes, they're sort of hard to understand and try to quantify the impact when they come, but they all seem to work their way into the marketplace without any major reorganization of what's happening.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, John. Next question for Andy. CHRW's leverage ratio remains at lower end of its one to one-and-a-half times debt-to-EBITDA target. How is management thinking about the company's current leverage ratio in light of an uncertain demand outlook and the potential uses of debt capital buybacks and M&A?","Andrew Clarke","Yeah, we're comfortable with our current debt ratio and are comfortable just given the uncertain demand environment of being at the low end of that. We're also comfortable with our stated strategy of returning 90% of our net income in the form of buybacks and dividends. And in fact, the first quarter, between buybacks, dividends and the shares withheld that was 99%, almost 100% of our net income was distributed to our shareholders in the first quarter.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Outside of the anticipated convergence of costs to your customer and costs paid to carriers, what do you see as the biggest challenge to achieving 5% to 10% growth in your truckload and LTL segments?","John Wiehoff","When we think about the market cycles and the margin contraction and expansion, obviously it's a pretty important topic on these calls because it can add some headwind or tailwind to our earnings growth based upon where we're at in the cycle. I think we've shared in the past that when we analyze that over time, we actually feel very comfortable with our committed relationships on both the shipper side and the carrier side that those increases have been very similar over a longer period of time. They just move at differing rates, which can have an impact. So if you strip that out and just say: hey, what's the longer-term secular challenges around growing market share and expanding the 3PL presence in both truckload and LTL? That comes back to some of our core value-added things that I talked about in my prepared comments.","We think when we have better people and better account managers that bring insight into those relationships, when we have a better business process for consolidating and deconsolidating, when we have better analytics, when we have better information and a better system that helps customers manage their freight better and understand their costs and go to market more effectively, those are all things that drive the long-term value. So staying competitive and evolving our competitive advantages in all of those kind of core competency areas are what gives us the confidence and gives us the focus of how we'll continue to take share across both the TL and LTL segment. And at the same time we \u2013 like I've mentioned many times on this call, we've got to work through those contraction and expansion cycles on pricing and margins to make sure that we're adapting to market conditions and helping our partners do the same.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, John. The next question for Andy. Is the $2.6 million expense rate to the restricted equity delivery expected to recur during the balance of 2016?","Andrew Clarke","No. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that was a one-time event in the first quarter for 2016. So it won't continue to occur. And just as a refresher, these are from equity awards that were granted years ago that were vesting seven years ago, that were vesting and finally coming due.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, Andy. Next question for John. Are you concerned that the truckload pricing currently available to smaller carriers will accelerate the shakeout of the industry even before they have to install ELDs?","John Wiehoff","I think I pretty much addressed this one in one of the previous questions that certainly the timing of these cost increases could impact any carrier's decision around whether they want to stay in the business or exit. I wouldn't say concern is the right level. It's certainly a metric that we monitor and it's relevant to what's happening in the marketplace, but we would kind of throw it into the bucket of normal ebb and flow activity around the economics of adding capacity and how things churn in the marketplace.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy on interest expense. The interest expense of $8.8 million was higher than the $6.5 million we were modeling. Were there other issues like in Q4 2015 when you had an indemnification issue? In Q2 2015 you suggested about $7 million a quarter. Please provide updated thoughts.","Andrew Clarke","Yeah, we expect our quarterly interest expense to be between $6.5 million and $7 million. In the first quarter of this year, what we had was a currency revaluation expense of approximately $1.5 million. And as currencies change, so will this number, although we think it'll be a lot less on a go-forward basis.","Timothy Gagnon","Thank you, Andy. Next question for John. Can you discuss competitive trends? Also, have you seen any impact from new app-based brokerage services?","John Wiehoff","We've commented often about the fact that there are literally thousands of competitors and it remains a very competitive market and the tools and approaches are changing. I don't think there's anything that we're aware of that has meaningfully changed or moved in the last quarter or two, specifically with regards to new competitors that are touting app-based brokerage services. We can't identify anything specific that's going on with that. We do have our own carrier mobile app that we're coming out this year with an enhanced release of, and we think that particularly on status events and updates and maybe more and more on freight offerings, that there are some tools there that will stick in the marketplace and be useful.","Obviously, you need to have freight relationships and meaningful customers in order to really utilize those tools and take it to the market, and we think that can be part of our technology evolution that will help us keep our market-leading position. But to-date, we haven't seen any specific competitive impacts that we would credit to that.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, John. And our last question will be for Andy. How sustainable is the benefit from lower bad debt expense? It seems from the slides that that was a big driver of lower total costs during the quarter.","Andrew Clarke","Yeah, well, we think it is sustainable. We've got a really good credit and collections processes in place and, obviously, having high-quality customers, global customers that have a high credit quality has helped us really manage our allowance for doubtful accounts and, quite frankly, our bad debt expense. We think this is a key competitive advantage for us. So it is sustainable.","Timothy Gagnon","Thanks, Andy. And unfortunately, we're out of time.

(NASDAQ:CHRW) Q3 2017 Earnings Call November  1, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson third quarter 2017 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, Tim Gagnon will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions.","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, November 1, 2017. I will now turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, the Director of Investor Relations.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Clarke, the Chief Financial Officer. John and Andy will provide some prepared remarks on highlights of our third quarter results. We will follow that with a response to the pre-submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday.","Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate the discussion. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Andy will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments. I'd like to remind you that comments made by John, Andy, or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","With that, I'll turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments on slide 3, with a review of our third quarter results.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our call this morning, and I'll start right in with the results for our third quarter. Total revenues increased 12.8% in the third quarter, driven by volume growth across most all of our transportation services, increased pricing, and higher fuel costs compared to last year. Total company net revenues increased 6.3% in the quarter. APC Logistics added approximately 2% to our total net revenues in the quarter with organic net revenues up approximately 4%. This will be the last quarter where APC integration will be highlighted as we have now fully cycled through the first year of the acquisition.","Operating expense growth outpaced net revenue growth in the quarter, resulting in a year-over-year decrease in operating income and net income. Operating income was $194 million in the third quarter, down 8% from last year, and net income was $119 million, down 7.6%. Average head count was up 8.7% versus last year's third quarter. The APC and Milgram Global Forwarding acquisitions accounted for about 5% of that increase and the remainder was organic. Diluted earnings per share was $0.85 in the third quarter, down from $0.90 last year.","Andy will be talking us through the deck and our results by business segment, but before he does that, I'd like to highlight a couple themes that you'll hear throughout our remarks. Hurricanes were obviously a significant event this quarter, and like most in our industry, they did impact us, too. Our offices in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida all had to deal with the difficult circumstances of the storm. Many on our team gave extraordinary effort to take care of personal challenges while continuing to serve our customers. We often emphasize how critical it is in our business to have the right people, culture, and teamwork in place, and there are some incredible examples of Robinson team members going above and beyond to make it through these catastrophes. I want to start by thanking them for their hard work and commitment to Robinson and their customers.","In terms of the financial impact of the storms to Robinson, there were two types of impacts that you will be hearing more about. The most immediate impact is in the areas where we lost or gained shipments and product orders due to the storms. We estimate those impacts likely had a net positive impact on our NAST division and a net negative impact on Robinson Fresh.","The other impact from the storms is the resulting price increases in the North American truckload market due to the storm disruption. In our Q2 commentary on our results, we discussed, at length, the rising cost of truckload transportation and how we were adjusting to the market. While it's not possible for us to isolate the pricing impact of the hurricanes, they clearly contributed to further escalation of price increases in the quarter.","Andy will cover our metrics on truckload price increases and how they escalated throughout Q3. While rapidly rising prices does often create incremental spot market activity, it can also create more margin compression on committed pricing arrangements. We experienced both of these impacts in our Q3 results. The pricing trends and required adjustments to market conditions that we discussed at length last quarter continued and were accelerated by the hurricane impacts.","The other theme that you will continue to hear from us is in regards to increased focus on reducing our operating expenses. We are committed to continued efficiency and productivity gains that will help us reduce our operating expenses in future periods. As we stated last quarter, we continue to focus on growing our net revenues and expenses at similar rates over longer periods of time. As we continue to invest in acquisitions, technology, and diversifying our business, we will also be very focused on cost control and driving efficiency gains.","So, with those introductory comments, I will turn it over to Andy.","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, John, and thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone. I would like to echo John's praise and thanks to our network for their efforts in the third quarter. In North America, the devastating storms created a rather chaotic environment, and Robinson stepped up and responded to the challenge. Globally, our teams continue to grow volumes double digits and net revenue at an impressive pace, and the results in the quarter reflect their hard work.","Additionally, we lapped the first anniversary of the APC acquisition in Australia and New Zealand, and successfully completed the purchase of Milgram & Company in Canada. Busy times, but the entire organization remains focused on delivering long-term shareholder value.","Now, to the summarized income statement on slide 4. Net revenues increased 6.3%, to $594 million. The trend accelerated as the quarter progressed, rising dramatically in September. Total company net revenue per business day increased 3% in July, 4% in August, and 18% in September. I will provide more detail on the drivers for the improved results in September when I review the services and segment performance.","Personnel expenses increased 14.1% from last year as a result of an 8.7% increase in head count and higher variable compensation. We've mentioned in the past that our compensation plans are annual, but adjusted on a quarterly basis. The adjustments this quarter are increasing as the results improved during the quarter, while last year's results were declining in the quarter. Year-to-date, our personnel expense is up 7.9%, driven by an increased head count of 8.3%.","SG&A expenses were $106 million in the quarter, up $16 million from last year. The increase can be explained by the following: costs related to the addition of APC and Milgram of approximately $6 million, which includes amortization; a higher allowance for doubtful accounts of $3 million; claims of $2.5 million; and real estate expenses of $1.6 million.","Operating income as a percentage of net revenues was 32.7% compared to 37.8% in last year's quarter. However, it is up 100 basis points from Q2 of this year. We did have one less business day in this year's third quarter when compared to last year, which equates to over $9 million of net revenue.","The effective tax rate was 35.2% in the third quarter, and year-to-date, 34.2%. Our tax rate has had some variability through the year as a result of new accounting rules related to stock compensation and our APB 23 election last year. We will continue to manage our tax expenses and look for ways to drive down the effective tax rates.","Slide 5 and other financial information. We generated $68.3 million in cash in the quarter and have $13.4 million in capital expenditures. The largest driver of the decrease in cash flow from operations versus last year was the increase in accounts receivable during the quarter. Increased volumes, customer rates, and costs of transportation, including fuel prices, resulted in increased growth in working capital. While we need to do a better job of working with our customers to drive down our DSO, it is normal to see receivables grow during periods of accelerating top line growth.","We finished the quarter with $297 million in cash, up just over $24 million from Q2. Our debt balance is $1.47 billion, up $127 million since Q2, as a result of the Milgram acquisition and increased working capital needs. For the year, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $60 million.","On to slide 6, on our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $125 million to shareholders in the quarter, with just under $64 million in dividends and approximately $61 million in share repurchases. In the quarter, 105% of our net income was returned to shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned 92%, which is in line with our stated annual objectives.","And now, to slide 7 and net revenue by service. As a reminder, this slide represents the service revenues for all of our business units. I will not review this slide in detail, but rather make comments about the various services within the business segments.","Slide 8, and our North America truckload price and cost chart. On this graph, the light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in North America truckload rate, and cost per mile to customers and carriers net of fuel costs since 2008. The gray line, of course, is the net revenue margin for all transportation services. In this year's third quarter, the North America truckload rate per mile, net of fuel, was up 6.5% versus last year, while the cost per mile increased 8.5%. The last time we saw this great of a sequential change in the price and cost versus prior year was in Q1 of 2014, when snowstorms blanketed most of the United States. The year-over-year change in purchased transportation costs did rise through the quarter, increasing 6.5% in both July and August, and 11% in September. Customer pricing also increased throughout the quarter, but continues to lag the increase in costs. Our transportation net revenue margin increased 20 basis points sequentially as both NAST and Global Forwarding had higher net revenue margins than in Q2.","Slide 9 and our transportation results. The transportation total revenue for all segments were up 14.5% to $3.4 billion in the third quarter. The drivers of our total revenue growth were strong volume growth of 8% across all our service lines and rising prices in most transportation services. Versus last year, transportation net revenue margin decreased 16.4%. This was the result of lower margins on our NAST services and higher fuel prices. The mix shift of a higher share of Global Forwarding revenues in this year's quarter partially offset that decline.","And now, slide 10 and the reportable segments. In the North American Surface Transportation segment, total revenues were approximately $2.5 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 9.6% over last year. NAST net revenues decreased slightly to $377 million in the quarter. NAST September 2017 net revenues, however, increased when compared to September of last year.","Net revenue margin was 15.3% in the third quarter, down 150 basis points from last year. However, margin did improve 20 basis points sequentially. The lower year-over-year margins were primarily the result of increased purchased transportation costs in both the truckload and LTL service lines. Our truckload contractual business had lower margins in the quarter compared to transactional business, which improved significantly late in the quarter.","As a reminder, we have tens of thousands of unique contracts, and last quarter, we mentioned the importance of account management and the focus on award management in the contractual business. This is always a priority when we are in an environment of increasing cost, and our account managers did a nice job of fulfilling our commitments while pricing opportunities outside of those commitments at a higher spot market rate.","NAST income from operations was down 11.8% to $151 million. Operating expenses increased 9.5% as a result of an increase in both personnel and SG&A expenses. The increase in personnel expenses was driven by an increase in cash compensation from additional head count and higher variable compensation expense when compared to last year's third quarter.","The increase in SG&A was the result of a higher allowance for doubtful accounts I explained earlier, as well as increased overhead charges related to higher spending and technology development. NAST operating margin was 40.1% in the quarter, down from 45.4% last year. Employee count was 6,998, up 1.9% from last year's third quarter, and flat sequentially.","Now, slide 11 and the results by service within NAST. NAST truckload net revenues were $267 million, down 2.1% from last year. On our second quarter call, we mentioned that we were adapting to the tight capacity and rising price environment. We have and will continue to honor our customer commitments, and actively manage our freight opportunities as customer routing guides deteriorate. Truckload volume was flat year-over-year in the third quarter, and this decline in volume growth relates to lower volumes in committed freight as routing guides deteriorated. The lower contractual volumes were offset by higher volumes of transactional shipments in this year's third quarter compared to last year. We often highlight routing guide performance measured in our Managed Service business to quantify the impact of market volatility.","The month of September represented the most volatile routing guide performance we have seen since early 2014. On a national basis, the routing guide was2.2 and spiked to over 5 in certain markets. The transactional volumes were driven in large part by the hurricanes in late August and early September. We estimate the additional volume generated in support of the relief efforts did benefit our business overall, though the opportunities to support the relief efforts were partially offset by the fact that two of our largest inbound and outbound markets were essentially offline for a week during the quarter.","We added 3,600 new carriers in the third quarter compared to approximately 4,200 added in last year's third quarter. Though this new carrier count is down from last year, these new carriers moved approximately the same number of loads, 18,000, as the 4,200 moved last year. LTL net revenue increased 4.8% to $97.6 million. Volumes increased 6.5% when compared to last year, and purchased transportation cost increased in the quarter, putting pressure on margins. Strong demand in the manufacturing and e-commerce sectors drove the growth in the LTL business, and the rising truckload cost benefited LTL volumes as well. Intermodal net revenues decreased 1.4% in the quarter, with volumes up 13%. Over the past several quarters, we have been growing our contractual business at lower margins, while transactional volumes are down quite a bit from last year's third quarter.","And now to Global Forwarding. First, let me say congratulations to the Global Forwarding team, whose results were remarkable. They achieved record net revenue and operating income for the second quarter in a row. The entire organization has proven successful in maintaining solid organic growth while integrating both the APC and Milgram acquisition over the last several quarters. Total revenues for Global Forwarding segment in the third quarter were $552 million, up 41.3% versus last year. Third quarter net revenues were $129.8 million, a 39.1% increase from 2016. APC Logistics and Milgram & Company contributed 18% to the growth, while organic growth was an impressive 21% in the quarter. Net revenue margins were 23.5%, down slightly from last year.","Income from operations was up 82.6% to just over $31 million, and operating margin was 24% in the quarter, up dramatically from 18.3% last year as the team operated very effectively. Headcount increased 20.8% in the quarter compared to the third quarter of last year, with APC and Milgram representing approximately 650 employees or 18% of the additional head count in the business. Again, congratulations to our Global Forwarding teams, including APC and Milgram & Company.","Moving on to Global Forwarding service lines on slide 13. Ocean net revenues were up 44% with the acquisition of APC and Milgram contributing approximately 17% to the growth. Ocean shipments increased approximately 22% in the quarter. Air net revenues increased 32.7%, with the acquisitions contributing 15% to this growth. Net revenue margins did decline slightly in the air services during the quarter as we continued to execute on our strategy to grow volume and density in our air gateway cities. Air shipments increased approximately 28% in the quarter. Customs net revenue increased 41.4%, with the acquisitions contributing 30% to the growth. Customs transactions increased approximately 52% in the third quarter.","As mentioned, the integrations of both APC and Milgram are going well, and one of the drivers of the net revenue growth in the quarter is the conversion of former APC agent business into our Global Forwarding network. We expect successful agent conversion, albeit on a smaller base, with the Milgram acquisition.","Transitioning to our Robinson Fresh business on slide 14. I will start my comments by touching on the hurricane impact to the Robinson Fresh organization. The hurricanes in both Texas and Florida had a negative impact on the Robinson Fresh cases volumes and net revenue in the quarter. We have service center facilities in both of these locations that were shut down for 7 to 10 days as a result of the storms. Like the rest of the organization, the Fresh team did a great job of working with their customers and providers to assist them during this challenging time. Robinson Fresh total revenues were $614 million, an increase of 3.9% in the third quarter. Net revenues were $54 million, down 4.9% from last year. The decrease in truckload net revenues was primarily the reason for net revenue declines in the quarter. Robinson Fresh operating expenses increased 8.6% in the third quarter. The increase was primarily due to increases in both personnel and SG&A expenses. The SG&A increase was primarily the result of an increase in warehousing expense related to expanding facilities. Income from operations was $11.6 million, a decrease of 34.7%, and Robinson Fresh average head count increased 1.5% in the quarter.","Slide 15. Robinson Fresh sourcing total revenues decreased 1.8% in the third quarter. Sourcing net revenues were virtually flat when compared to last year's third quarter. A slight increase in net revenue margin was offset by a case volume decline of 1%. As mentioned, the hurricanes negatively impacted Robinson Fresh case volumes and net revenues in the quarter.","And now to slide 16 and the Robinson Fresh transportation business. Robinson Fresh transportation total revenues increased 12.7% in the third quarter of 2017, driven by volume growth of 13%. Robinson Fresh transportation net revenues decreased 10%, however, primarily due to truckload net revenues declining 13.9% in the quarter. The margin compression of Robinson Fresh truckload business is the result of a higher concentration of contractual business within their portfolio of customers. Fresh truckload has a significantly higher portion of its business committed versus NAST. We continue to see strong volume growth in the Robinson Fresh transportation business, with a 13% year-over-year increase in the third quarter. Other transportation services, which include LTL and intermodal, had a good quarter with 9% net revenue growth.","Moving on to All Other and Corporate on slide 17. All Other includes our Managed Services business, as well as surface transportation outside of North America and other miscellaneous revenues, as well as unallocated corporate expenses. Headcount was up 13.4%, and this was primarily the result of personnel increases in technology, other enterprise resources, European Surface Transportation, and Managed Services.","Slide 18, net revenues for the Other category increased 7.9% in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, led by the continued strong performance in our Managed Services, aided by an increase in net revenue in the European Surface Transportation business. Managed Services net revenue increased 10.8% in the third quarter of 2017 to $18.5 million. This net revenue increase was a result of new business. Other Surface Transportation net revenues increased 4.2% in the third quarter to $13.9 million. The increase was primarily the result of truckload volume growth in Europe, partially offset by truckload margin compression.","I will conclude my remarks by again thanking the Robinson team for their performance during the quarter. We made some large improvements versus Q2, and look to build on those as we close out the year and go into 2018. The disruption in the quarter provided everyone with a glimpse of how established organizations with the right people, the right process, and the right technology perform when supply chains simply don't. Thank you for listening to us this morning. I will turn it back to John to make some closing comments before we answer some of your questions.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Andy. So, before we move to those questions, I will wrap things up with some final comments. In October to date, our total company net revenue has increased approximately 8% per business day. This does include additional revenues from the Milgram acquisition. Our North American truckload volume growth is flat versus October to date.","With regards to our current priorities and key initiatives that we are focused on, there are a couple of thoughts to share. As was talked about, our Milgram acquisition in Canada is being integrated into our Global Forwarding network. As you've seen in our results, our Global Forwarding team has good momentum and has been very successful at expanding our global network. We expect this integration to go well, and it will be a key priority for us as we continue our growth in Global Forwarding.","Adjusting to the market and the changes in truckload pricing will be very important over the next couple quarters. Our account management practices, including how we price and change with the market, is always an important component of how we serve our customers. The current market events, including the storms and the ELD requirements in December, are contributing to increased price volatility and changes for all of us. We need to get committed truckload pricing right over the next several quarters to ensure consistent service as the markets change.","The last two bullet points around focusing on growth and operating expense control are not new ideas, but we definitely have some new focus areas and priorities. Selling, servicing our customers, and growing our market share continues to be at the core of our business model and approach to creating value. All of our operating divisions have updated go-to-market strategies, and we believe there are significant opportunities for market share gains across our company. We have new capabilities and visibility, analytics, vertical expertise and order management, to name a few of our priorities. We will remain aggressive in innovating and growing our services.","Efficiency and cost control is also not a new idea, but worth sharing how we're thinking about productivity and expense control. Many of our initiatives and priorities tie directly to our digital strategies and network transformation that we introduced to you at our Investor Day earlier this year. As we continue to invest in our Navisphere platform and digital capabilities, we are evolving our operating networks with the goal of significant efficiency gains. Those iniatives include some office consolidation, driving increases in automated exchanges with shippers and carriers, and supporting internal process automation in Navisphere. As we continue to invest in our people and our Navisphere platform, we'll also be elevating our goals for productivity and efficiency gains. In addition to the personnel efficiency goals, we are also creating new focus for all general and administrative cost categories to look for opportunities to reduce costs as well.","That concludes my prepared comments, and with that, I will turn it back to the operator so we can answer the pre-submitted questions.","Operator","Mr. Gagnon, the floor is yours for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Donna. And I'll kick off the Q&A here by thanking the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions to us last evening. I'll frame the question up and turn it right over to John and Andy, and we'll jump right into it now.","And the first question is for Andy. Please discuss NAST truckload volume growth. Was there a tradeoff between contractual freight and transactional freight that resulted in flat volumes during the quarter, or some other factor? If possible, can you provide an idea of how much volume was contract versus spot in the quarter?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. The volume levels and growth that we saw during the quarter were pretty consistent for July, August, and September. We've talked at length about our account management and award management, and the account managers out there having conversations every day with their customers, particularly as the quarter progressed and routing guides continued to deteriorate, and in some cases, actually outright failed. And as a result, our spot market business grew greater in September \u2013 the last two weeks of August and into September than the committed volume basis on that time period.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Given your experience in transportation space, how would you characterize the current market? Are there any other historical times you could point to that mirror the current environment? Given your experience, how are you thinking about the potential duration of this cycle maybe in relation to prior cycles you have experienced?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So, looking back at history and trying to decipher if there's anything to be learned about kind of where we're at in this cycle, I guess I would start by referring the group back to slide 8 in our presentation that Andy spoke to on pricing. There's 10 years of history there. This is information that is pretty critical to how we think about where we're at in the cycle. So, if you look at those dark and blue lines on slide 8, and the 10-year average of activity, we've pointed out previously that this ten-year average is about a 3% increase. So, while there's ups and downs in cycles across the past periods here, the average is maybe a little bit greater than inflation in terms of both customer and cost increases during that period of time.","I think the specific answer to the question is that when you see the pricing and cost lines racing upward in 2017, looking back in 2014 during the snowstorms and early -- late 2009, early 2010, during the recovery of the financial crisis, you see two other periods where the cyclicality of the pricing was racing northward, and it felt very similar to the period that we're into today. When we study this past and our pricing behavior, and think about how long will this cycle last and what might we learn from it, a couple more observations that I would share, I guess, is that if you look at the 2017 activity, we are coming off of almost a full two-year period where average pricing was below that 3% long term. So, coming into this year, there had been a fairly meaningful period of price adjustments that were below the long-term average. And I don't think there's anybody in the industry that I've spoken to that doesn't expect prices to increase in 2018. So clearly, some momentum for continued upward movement.","When you think about the cyclical and secular changes, and what might be different this time around, obviously, ELDs and the pending regulation changes in December are a significant item as well, too. So, I think probably the biggest unanswered question of the cycle versus the secular changes is, are these increases that we're experiencing this year, might they sort of peak in 2018 in a normal cycle or will ELD and capacity-related changes make the upward part of this pricing cycle extend even a little bit longer.","So, the summary is there are periods of time where these upward price changes feel similar to 2014, 2009, but then there are also some kind of interesting questions that \u2013 where history may not be a good guide as to how long this cycle may last.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question is for Andy. What was the split of contractual versus transactional volumes in NAST truckload during the third quarter? Given the material change in spot truckload conditions during the third quarter, do you expect to materially shift this mix towards transactional volumes during 2018?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","The answer to the first question is we saw approximately a 10-point swing in our ratio of committed or contractual to spot. So, we ended the quarter just under 60% of our business being in that committed and contractual and just 40% to slightly above on the spot market, which is down from where we had seen that ratio in the high 60%s \u2013 so, 65%, 66% earlier in the year on the committed, and 33%, 34% on the spot. So, we did see that shift, as I mentioned in the first part of the Q&A, that we did see that shift.","Now, as it relates to the expectations for the rest of the year or 2018, that's the great news, is we have wonderful account managers and salespeople that are out there having conversations every day with their customers. And I will just dovetail with what John was saying in that last comment and referencing the slides. So, we are having those conversations with the customers. And at corporate, we don't have a specific view. Our account managers are out there having those conversations, and we're talking about rising prices. We are talking about routing guides, and we are talking about where our customers want to be in a committed or a spot market scenario.","And so those conversations are happening every day, and we talk about the rotation and the cadence with which we have those conversations. Roughly 60%, just less than 60% happen in Q1 and Q2. And we're having those conversations even starting today in the fourth quarter going into next year. And where it shakes out is where it shakes out, but it will depend on the balance between those customers and our viewpoint on where prices are going to end up.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. At what point does automation of various elements of the brokerage process enable the company to scale back the head count growth, if ever?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","This is the question that we wrestle with a lot around our digital transformation and applying the technology to our business, and trying to figure out what our growth and productivity expectations should be. One thing that is important to understand in this is that we do feel like we have already seen some meaningful benefits of automation and the related head count and productivity gains. Our implementation of segment reporting and the diversification of our business, I think, is pretty relevant to this topic.","If you look at where a lot of our head count additions have come over the last several years while we've been taking market share, we've grown a lot in Global Forwarding in other parts of the world, where the labor equation and the processes are very different. We have invested a lot in building our own technology as opposed to buying it. So, you see a lot of head count additions in our IT area, where we're hiring and training developers, and making proprietary tools as opposed to just purchasing it from others. And you also see significant head count additions in our Managed Services business, where we're growing with more integrated and combined software and people solutions that are different.","So, if you take those aside and look back to kind of the more digital automated processes of truck brokerage and kind of some of the core activities that we do, we have already seen in certain job families, much more significant productivity improvements in the number of shipments per person and the level of activity that has gone on.","As we look forward and think about continuing to invest in the platform, I mentioned in my prepared comments that we do feel, with scaled carrier centers and leveraging mobile technology and leveraging API technology, that more and more, we are going to see significant gains in those productivity opportunities within select job families, where the technology can make a greater and greater impact on it. So, we are going to do the best we can to be transparent around the various components of the business, and what impact the technology investments and automation are having on them and their outcoming efficiencies.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. And the next question is for Andy. What were the drivers for the strong organic net revenue growth in the Global Forwarding business?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","The Global Forwarding team continues to do a great job of focusing on their go-to-market strategy. They have had a wonderful execution over the last several quarters. They've got great account management when they go and engage their customers. We're the number one -- we have retained yet again our number one NVO status from China to United States. We built out a global platform, and the team has done just a wonderful job of staying focused on the execution and staying focused on their go-to-market and building out the areas of ocean forwarding. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our gateway cities. And obviously, on the customs side, we've been able to integrate now, coming up on our second acquisition, and at the same time, use those as leverage points to go in and have more conversations with our customers.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Please discuss the competitive landscape. Given the shifting freight environment, does that create more opportunities for startups or nontraditional providers, or does it support traditional models? Has there been any discernible shift to new entrants in the market?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","The overall answer to the question is no, we have not seen any discernible shifts in the competitive landscape, but let me expand on that a little bit because when you go to a large shipper's carrier conference or when you interact with them, one of the things that you're constantly reminded of is that it is a very fragmented, competitive landscape. It's not uncommon for there to be several hundred providers in the room, and probably several hundred more who didn't have enough activity to get invited to events like that. So, much of what we learn about the competitive landscape in any one customer or vertical does become more anecdotal around what you see and hear based on who's doing press releases or what other activity may be going on.","Another comment that I think is relevant, though, is that during times of more stable route guides and more stable prices, or particular declining pricings, I do think, in general, it's more typical for a shipper to think about renewing incumbents at flat to declining prices and keeping volumes static, or growing volume in those lower or to declining prices. When we go through a period of time like we're in now, where prices are rising rapidly, that puts pressure on all of us, the shippers and the providers, to kind of reprice and think about where there might be opportunities to be more efficient or where you can mitigate some of the price increases that are happening in the marketplace. Those environments probably are more naturally logical times for new entrants or new participants to participate and to get some freight. Almost every shipper that I've ever interacted with is thoughtful and probably cautious about how and when they introduce new providers, to make sure that they put them in the right spots and test them, and see if they get traction over time.","So, there may be, in this type of an environment, a better opportunity for newer players to insert themselves where others are leaving in the route guide or where prices are increasing significantly, and then it takes time to sort out who gets traction and who can really provide the service metrics and keep the customers happy over a longer period of time.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question on SG&A for Andy. You mentioned an increase in the provision for bad debt, claims expense and warehouse cost. Was there anything one-time in nature related to these expense increases or were the increases tied simply to the increase in volume handled during the quarter?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","We had a little bit of expense related to the acquisition of Milgram during the quarter, not really material, which I would consider to be one-time. As it relates to the allowance, as it relates to the claims and the warehouse, there's nothing in there that is one time. I would like to expand a little bit on the allowance, though, and that as volumes increase, as that gross revenue number arises, we will see that allowance, and we'll balance that against what our actual experience is in bad debt write-offs. And over the last several years, we have not seen, knock wood, a material change in any way on our experience. So, despite the fact that we're growing our gross revenue nicely, we're not writing off any more than we ever have. It's just the way the accounting rules work, is when you have more of those revenues, you need to reserve for them, but we balance that against what the actual write-off is.","The warehouse expense that we mentioned, we put that in, in the fourth quarter of last year. So, on a year-over-year basis during \u2013 in future periods, there won't be a change to that. Claims, you look at them from two perspectives. One, the frequency; and, two, the severity. And in the quarter, we had, I would say, a greater number of less severe claims than what we might have experienced in the past. So, nothing unusual about those items either.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. What is your forecast for margin improvement in the Robinson Fresh truckload business?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Our forecast would be gradual margin improvement over the next several quarters. Because the Robinson Fresh business is \u2013 the transportation truckload business is more concentrated in 12 to 15 larger shippers, where it's generally longer length of haul, generally mostly temperature-controlled type freight. It is much more committed than the broader book of business, and repricing cycles will generally take longer. Given some of the unique dynamics in the marketplace, as you saw in the Q3 results, the margin compression sustained itself in the Robinson Fresh truckload business more this quarter than it did within NAST. We will be using the same account management techniques and processes, and adjusting to the market, just like we have been within the NAST business, but it will take a little bit longer, and hopefully, will show gradual improvement over the next several quarters.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question on APC for Andy. With regard to last year's acquisition of APC Logistics, can management provide an update on its progress bringing agency business in China and Europe onto the core C.H. Robinson platform? Does strong global trade demand create a favorable environment to win the business? Also, can we expect to see similar net revenue opportunities from agent conversions in the Milgram business similar to APC?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","I will start with the middle question, which revolves around strong global demand. Yes, certainly, strong global demand does help us and others win business. We are growing well in excess of the overall marketplace, but it's always helpful to have a growing marketplace.","With respect and regard to the APC acquisition and the conversion of the agents, yeah, it's gone very well. The team, our C.H. Robinson team in Asia and our C.H. Robinson team in Europe have worked very well with our new company, APC, in Australia and New Zealand to identify the customers, to identify the business processes, and identify the right way to convert that business onto the platform. And we're happy to report that virtually all of the business that APC had controlled through other agents in those markets have converted over to the C.H. Robinson platform. It's worked very well, and I would also add that, in addition, it allows us to now \u2013 so that's just one part of it. With all the other customers that we and they had both independently, when you respond to global RFPs, one of the boxes that you have to check are whether or not you have a company store or your own brand in those other markets. And if you don't, there are some customers that do not allow you to bid on that type of business.","We are now getting access to a lot more organic growth and organic opportunities because we and they both have had customers that, in the past, would not allow us to execute that level of business in those lanes because we were each other's agent. But now that we are all C.H. Robinson, we are getting access to a lot of that freight, and we would expect that to continue into 2018 and beyond.","As it relates to Milgram, again, we are in the very early innings of the Milgram acquisition, but progress is going very well. It is a smaller base. It's a smaller company than APC, but we do expect to see those opportunities from agent conversions in the acquisition.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Please discuss the ELD mandate's impact on the business over the last few months.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","The impact of the ELDs over the last few months has really been not significant. There's been a few protests and a lot of discussion about it, but with the pending regulations in December, we really haven't seen any meaningful changes to date. The possible exception is that when people are thinking about committed pricing and looking to the future, given that everybody is expecting some capacity contraction and impact around it, it could be impacting people's thoughts and attitudes around what the future pricing may be. The more common question around what do we expect the ELD mandate impact to be in Q4 or going forward, you know what, I think we have answered that a number of times and still have the view that similar to hours of service or CSA regulatory impacts in the past, that there will be an impact. There are lots of estimates around how significant it will be. We understand that there will be a market reaction, that there may be some capacity that chooses to exit the marketplace, or some may route their capacity or limit their miles differently. But overall, we feel like that will get worked through in the first quarter or two of next year, and we will be helping shippers adjust to any changes in the marketplace that happen from it.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. What was the average net revenue margin on spot truckload brokerage business in the third quarter? How much better was it than the contractual business?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","We do not and have not broken out net revenue margins on any of our truckload business, whether it's spot or committed. What I would offer is that for the first two months of the quarter, which were more on the stable side, what we've experienced historically is during those stable periods, you see that committed and spot tend to walk in lockstep. And so, there's not a material difference between margins on committed and spot. But, when Harvey hit and then Irma hit, and you get the last two weeks of August and then all of September, there was a dislocation in the spot market. And we saw the spot market margin jump several hundred basis points during that time period.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. What specific controls and operational efficiency targets are planned for the fourth quarter and beyond?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","One of the challenges that we have to be specific with our targets is that we have so much of our cost structure that is variable, and so much of it is personnel-oriented, which is pay for performance, that it's hard to target a lot of specific metrics on exactly what we hope it to be, because in many cases, if we're successful at growing our net revenue and growing our margins, it's going to drive increased costs as well, too, which are the good kind rather than the inefficient kinds that we're trying to get rid of.","When we think about moving forward, it's our overall statement that we think we can improve in all areas of the business. And improve means that key metric of income from operations as a percent of net revenue, that for some of our smaller divisions or our larger divisions, we are cycling up and down. When we cycle up with pricing and expanding margins, that typically helps us gain some improvement in those overall cost metrics. So, by leveraging our technology and process improvements that I talked about earlier, and taking advantage of cyclical expansion of margins, those are good periods of time for us where we can hopefully show some improvement in our efficiency metrics.","The other component of that, that I would like to sort of reemphasize along with this question is that as we've diversified our business over the last 10 years, mix has a pretty meaningful impact on that key metric. If you look at our segments and you look at the Global Forwarding business, particularly since we've acquired a lot of the Global Forwarding business, the adding back the depreciation and amortization from those deals, and looking at the operating metrics for our Global Forwarding business separate, I think you see improvement in there. And while it's lower than the enterprise total, a lot of it is from the accounting impacts of the acquisition. So, we will be looking for relative improvements in all of the operating divisions based on the plans that we have in place, and our core cost and efficiency metric is that income from operations to net revenue relationship adjusted for whatever M&A activity there might be.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. Considering the investments in and utilization in data analytic capabilities during 2017 that were credited with CHRW's material improvement in awards per account during this year's bid season, is there any reduced confidence in those advancements' ability to sustainably drive share gains in NAST, considering 3Q 2017's truckload volume was essentially flat?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Short answer is no. There is not any reduced confidence in either the advances that we made, the teams that we've assembled, the analytics team that we've assembled, or the algorithms that they are using. The longer answer is, it's a lot of arts and sciences. And the science is in the algorithm and the art is in the account management and the wonderful people that we have across the United States and the globe that are dealing with the real-time implications of supply chain disruption. And having those conversations every day with our customers and feeding that information back into the algorithm, we actually remain even more confident that we're learning a lot of new information as the market develops, as customers develop, as pricing changes, and feeding that into the data analytics team and feeding that into the data science team, and them using that and bringing it back to the account managers and the general managers and the people on the floor. So, it's a real-time learning environment for all of us. And do we always get it right? No, we don't. But that's why you have the human intervention. That's why you have the 113-year history of doing this, that we're able to adjust on a real-time basis. So, our confidence is incredibly strong with what we are doing there.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. How much of the 8% net revenue per business day growth in October was organic, i.e. non-Milgram?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","The Milgram \u2013 the net revenue from the Milgram acquisition, we expect, will be about 1% of Robinson Enterprise net revenue. So, a little more material to the Global Forwarding division, but 1% to the overall enterprise. The Milgram acquisition, there's only one month included in the third quarter. And so, in terms of the month of October, it was less than 1%. So, almost entirely organic growth. And maybe the other comment, we always caution that we share these kind of mid-quarter numbers -- this is sort of later in the quarter, but we still have the quarter end impact that can change things significantly. Probably also good to remind you that with the lapping of the APC acquisition and Milgram being smaller in October, there is less growth from the Global Forwarding division and more from the truckload trends of improvement within that.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. With the ELD mandate fast approaching, how many of your carriers do you believe are compliant? Have you noticed a change in your carrier base as the adjustment to an ELD-regulated world approaches?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","We haven't seen a change to our carrier base. It's \u2013 we're currently at over 42,000 active carriers today, which is up both sequentially from Q2, as well as up versus Q3 of last year. So, no change there. And as I said in my prepared remarks, those 3,200 carriers that we added did the same amount of loads, 18,000, that 4,200 did in Q3 of last year.","It's always difficult \u2013 we have talked about this at length, it's difficult to give you an exact number on how many of our carriers are currently ELD compliant. But, again, it's no surprise that the smaller carriers are always the last to adopt new technology, and have until December 18 of this year to adopt that. The good news is that the price of adoption continues to decrease. And so, we would expect the barrier of cost to adopt to not be an issue with our carriers in December of this year or 2018.","As how it all shakes out, John mentioned in a recent question \u2013 or answer to a recent question of, there will be a disruption. There will be a change to how they perform and whether or not they take a load. All of these different issues, I would only point everyone to the fact that it's very similar in that regard to a hurricane. And you see how our company performed during periods of disruption. We are going to be the ones that go out and secure the capacity for our customers to make sure that their supply chains continue to operate.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question on head count for John. Looking into the fourth quarter and early 2018, what are your expectations for head count growth?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Sequentially, for the remainder of this year and into next year, we would expect minimal head count growth. I mentioned earlier that there are several job families that we are seeing productivity gains. And with lower volume growth that we experience, we would expect minimal to flat head count growth in those areas. There are some -- we have the acquisition that, year-over-year, will show growth. And there are other areas of Managed Services and GF where we're growing faster, and there may be the need for some head count additions. But we are expecting that 2018 will be a year of improvement, and that, hopefully, we will be able to leverage some of our past investments to drive some efficiency gains.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. Should we expect M&A deals at the rate of about one deal per year or could that pace accelerate? Are you seeing or finding deals that are good fits, that are sizable enough, and attractively valued enough to be immediately accretive to EPS?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","I guess, like anything, it depends. In terms of the pace, we, as an organization, are capable of activating and completing more than a deal a year. And we do have a very active pipeline and feel confident about our ability to execute deals. However, we do have a strong vetting process. And two of the issues that were mentioned in that question are sizable, attractive, and accretive. And those are just a few of the issues that we vet. Cultural fit is highly important to us. Business model is very important to us. Strategic rationale is very important to us. And so, when we go to actually activate on these deals, we bring all of those issues and variables into the equation, and don't feel like we have to be compelled to complete a deal or more than a deal a year if they don't really make it through our rigorous vetting process. But if they do, we certainly can do more than a deal a year.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy, and thank you, everybody, for joining the call this morning.

Following today's presentation, Tim Gagnon will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today Tuesday, April 28, 2015. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, the Director of Investor Relations.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everybody. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, Chief Executive Officer; and Chad Lindbloom, Chief Financial and Chief Information Officer. John and Chad will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our first quarter, and we'll follow that with a response to pre-submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday. Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate the discussion. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website which is located at chrobinson.com.","John and Chad will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments this morning. I'd like to remind you that comments made by John, Chad or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","With that, I'll turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments on slide three with a review of our first quarter 2015 results.","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Looking at that slide three, our results for the first quarter of 2015, our total revenues for the quarter were $3.3 billion or a 5% increase over 2014. Net revenues increased 14.8% to $525 million, income from operations $181.9 million or a 15.9% increase and our earnings per share were up 16% at $0.73 per share for the quarter compared to $0.63 for year ago. Those are our key financial metrics in our overall results for the quarter that we were happy with.","If you look at the trends and themes that you will hear as we add our commentaries to the quarter, I think one of the highlights is the impact of fuel during the quarter. If you look at the difference between the growth rate in our total revenues and our net revenues, the change in decline in fuel price is the primary driver of that gap. We've talked in the past about how we believe that fuel is a pass-through in our business over time. When fuel is changing rapidly like it was during the first quarter, there can be timing differences in when surcharges adjust or it can impact people's decisions on other pricing decisions. So we don't know that it's a perfect pass-through for every month or every quarter, but over time, we're confident that it is. So you'll hear comments about fuel when we go through each of the service lines.","Similarly, you would hear about Freightquote. As a reminder, on the 1st of the year, we closed the acquisition of Freightquote, so it's a clean comparison in that the business began to cycle in on the first business day of 2015. So, we've tried to do the best we could to highlight the impact by service area of the impact of Freightquote during the quarter.","Lastly, I think it's important to understand the trends throughout the quarter, as well too, if you remember a year ago, there was significant change going on in the industry and in our business and things changed fairly aggressively throughout the first quarter a year ago. We talked last year about aggressive price changes and a very robust spot market in the March and April timeframe versus a year ago. You will hear several comments by me and Chad around how our business is trending and how it was changing throughout the quarter.","Our business this year is actually fairly stable sequentially from month-to-month as we grow, but our comparisons have changed quite a bit versus a year ago, particularly around the net profit per shipment in truckload and some of the pricing metrics that I'll be sharing with you. So overall a good quarter and those are the themes that you'll hear more of as we progress through the comments.","Moving then to page four, talking about our total transportation results for the first quarter of 2015, similar to the enterprise, total revenues were up five points, total net revenues were up 15% for the quarter.","We always like to highlight in the table below that there are a lot of factors that impact that transportation net revenue margin percentage. There are both cyclical and secular impacts that will impact these margins over time.","As I mentioned earlier, the fuel impact in the first quarter of 2015 was pretty significant as that fuel price reduces and changes in the pass-through of our customer and carrier impacts, it does have the impact of improving our net revenue margin percentage. There are also mix issues with some additional LTL freight through the Freightquote acquisition coming in, that can have a positive impact, and then there are the supply and demand cycles of truckload that will fluctuate our margins as well. So you can see 16.8% net revenue margins for the first quarter of 2015 in our overall transportation results.","Moving on to slide five in truckload, which is the largest portion of our transportation services. As you can see, the net revenues for the quarter increased 9.6%. Freightquote acquisition added approximately three percentage points to our truckload net revenue growth.","To see in the upper right-hand corner, our North American truckload volume grew 6% in the first quarter and Freightquote added about half of that volume growth. The approximate 3% volume growth without Freightquote is consistent with our growth pace from the past several quarters, and appears that the overall growth was slowing a bit at the end of the quarter, but that our volume growth was relatively consistent.","I'll comment more on this later, but we have seen some acceleration in our volume growth in April. And again as I talked in my opening comments a year ago, there was a lot of transition in the marketplace. We talked about making the price adjustments that we needed to adapt to those market conditions, the significance of increase in the amount of transactions that we were losing money on and how we were adjusting to the market conditions a year ago. We expected at the beginning of this year that we would be running into more difficult comparisons from a profit per shipment and a net revenue margin standpoint as we got into the March and April timeframe. We also expected that we would be continuing to add to our team and be more aggressively going after market share during this period, which is exactly what we're doing.","If you look at the upper right-hand corner of slide five again, around the North American truckload activity, the metrics that we share to try to help you understand the margin activity is our customer and cost pricing, which for the quarter was both approximately 6%. If you look at the trends throughout the first quarter, they were quite a bit different than that 6% average in January. Our average customer price increase was double-digit increase over the previous year. And by the end of the quarter in March, it was low single-digit increases in average prices to our customers.","So what that reflects is a year ago, those price increases were being implemented throughout the quarter. And this year, as more stable pricing compared to it, the year-over-year increase flattened as the quarter progressed.","We also talked a year ago about the very robust spot market that was accompanying the tension in the marketplace in March and April of a year ago. We believe this year that the spot market and demand activity has been much less versus a year ago. There have been some capacity additions. And all in all, we believe the spot market has presented fewer opportunities to us this March and April that have had an impact on our comparisons as well.","Moving on then to slide six and our LTL results for the first quarter, net revenues increased 42% in the first quarter and that includes our Freightquote net revenues. Freightquote was, about two-thirds of its net revenue was derived from LTL, so that added approximately 34% to our net \u2013 34 percentage points to our net revenue growth.","From a volume standpoint, LTL volumes grew 28% in the quarter and 19 percentage points of growth came as a result of the acquisition of Freightquote.","From an integration standpoint, I think we shared when we announced the deal that we do plan to integrate Freightquote. It is our expectation that through the majority of 2015, we will have reasonably meaningful quantified results of Freightquote to help you understand the impact as the year progresses. We are already deep into integration activities that have us sharing leads and sharing freight opportunities to cover truckload freight. So, those numbers would get a little less meaningful as the year wears on, but it is our intent to integrate the businesses and share the freight around the appropriate segments with the North America Surface Transportation network.","I think the overall message that we want to convey with Freightquote is that several months into it, we feel very good about our integration plans, we're on track. We're excited about our LTL position in the marketplace. We've had meetings with virtually all of our carrier partners in the marketplace and that one of our acquisition goals with Freightquote was to leverage our existing account management infrastructure, that's in place with both our shippers and carriers and make sure that we can be a cost-efficient go-to-market strategy for our partners and to handle our customer activity more effectively in the marketplace.","We also believe that we can help by making sure that the right freight is routed and tendered through the appropriate carrier based on what they want and how their network is situated. And with the combined volume of C.H. Robinson and Freightquote, we're feeling very good about our position in the marketplace with regards to LTL services.","Moving on to slide seven and our intermodal results for the quarter. Net revenue increased 17.6% in the first quarter and volume was up 14% for the quarter. Once again, Freightquote added 10 percentage points to intermodal net revenue growth and approximately 10 percentage points to volume growth. So, while Freightquote added to our growth in intermodal for the quarter, we believe that the West Coast port delays negatively impacted our intermodal volumes given some of the congestion and the inability of us to meet some of the service requirements with our rail activity. So a decent intermodal growth quarter helped by Freightquote and hampered a little bit by West Coast port delays.","Moving on then to our global forwarding, ocean\/air and custom results for the first quarter of 2015, Freightquote does not have any international activities. That is a growth opportunity and something that we do intend to pursue in the future. But in terms of the results for the first quarter of 2015, these represent all organic activities and no impact from Freightquote.","It was another strong quarter for our global forwarding team. Net revenue for the global forwarding services increased overall 15.2%, with ocean increasing 15.1%, air increased 18.2% and customs brokerage services were up 10% in net revenues for the quarter.","As we've talked over the past couple of quarters, we continue to feel very confident about our integration activities from the Phoenix acquisition more than two years ago. We have good momentum and continue to make operational improvements. We're focused on cross-selling the legacy Robinson and Phoenix customers together to make sure that we're penetrating our customer base most effectively and we continue to invest in our technology platform to improve our service offerings, our consolidation capabilities and our customer experience. Virtually all of the integration activity with the Phoenix acquisition is complete other than some ongoing technology investments that we will be making this year to continue to integrate the last parts of the global forwarding network. We continue to feel very good about our service capability and our market position in global forwarding.","Unlike intermodal, we do believe that the port delays on the West Coast probably helped our global forwarding business a little bit. We do know that several of our customers had difficult opportunities that we were able to help them with, and in some cases where customers were unable to get direct access to ocean capacity, we were able to help them with our capacity. So we do know of examples and believe that our global forwarding results probably were helped somewhat by the West Coast port delays. It's difficult to quantify exactly what that would have done to our business because we would like to believe that we would have been able to help them in other ways, if not for the delays. But we do believe that while it negatively impacted our intermodal business, there probably was a positive impact on our global forwarding business for the first quarter of 2015.","Moving on to slide nine in our other logistics services, net revenues for the first quarter increased 6.6% compared to the first quarter of 2014. Freightquote did add approximately two percentage points to our other logistics services in the first quarter.","As a reminder, again, these other logistics services include transportation management services, warehousing and small parcel. As we said in the previous couple quarters that we have had a slower growth of net revenue in other logistics services primarily due to some project revenue in the miscellaneous categories that has gone away and is not in the current periods. Our primary source of revenue in this category of managed services and transportation managed services continues to grow at a double-digit rate and continues to have a strong pipeline of new customers that we feel very confident about. This is a core growth initiative for us and we do expect the net revenue growth to remain at double digits in the future as we transition through some of the product comparisons in our other logistics services.","Moving on to slide 10 and our sourcing net revenues for the quarter, net revenues were up 11.6% in the first quarter of 2015. We talked last year about some of the customer transitions and difficulties that we had in the sourcing business in 2014. In the first quarter of 2015, that 8.5% net revenue margin represents a return to a more normalized margins in terms of what we expect going forward. We also had 9% case volume during the first quarter of 2015, which we were happy with and represents some growth in some of the key commodities that we've been emphasizing in our areas. So overall, it was more normalized activity in our sourcing business compared to weaker comparisons of the year ago and back to activity that we would expect a more normalized growth in the future.","Those conclude my comments on our growth by service line. And at this point, I'll turn it over to Chad to make some comments on our income statement on page 11.","Chad M. Lindbloom - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Information Officer","Thanks John. John has already talked a lot about our net revenues and what drove the increase in total net revenues of 14.8%. I will focus on the variances in personnel expense and other SG&A expenses. Our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased slightly compared to last year's first quarter. This increase was caused primarily by increased incentive compensation and by the acquisition of Freightquote. Our incentive compensation philosophy and plans have stayed relatively consistent with previous years. The increase is based on the growth in net revenues and earnings we experienced during the first quarter. Last year's first quarter had low incentive compensation due to our lack of earnings growth. This comparison issue is primarily for the first quarter. During the second quarter through fourth quarter of 2014, our earnings growth accelerated and we had greater incentive compensation. The impact from the Freightquote acquisition will continue for the rest of the year. They do have a higher personnel to net revenue compared to the core C.H. Robinson business. Our SG&A expenses increased 10.1% in the first quarter, driven primarily by the Freightquote expenses, including the amortization expense of approximately $1.9 million for the quarter. We also had an increase in claims expense, partially offset by a reduction in our provision for doubtful accounts.","I'm going to move on to Slide 12. We had a strong free cash flow quarter with cash flow from operations of approximately $100 million. In most first quarters, we have seasonally weaker cash flows compared to quarter two through quarter four as working capital tends to grow sequentially from increasing receivables and the bonus payments made in January. However, with the decrease in the price of fuel, our working capital did not grow as much as it usually does in the first quarter.","Moving on to CapEx, we had CapEx of $6.7 million for the quarter, including our investments in software. We still expect total CapEx, including software, to be about $40 million to $50 million for 2015. Included in this estimate is building a second data center for disaster recovery. Construction of that data center has not yet begun. We expect to spend $15 million to $20 million on the data center in 2015 and we expect to put the data center in service sometime during 2016. Our total debt balance remained relatively consistent with the end of the year at $1.1 billion.","Moving on to Slide 13, you can see that we have a long track record of significant cash distributions to our shareholders. We've talked for the last year or so about our goal of disturbing 90% of our net income to shareholders in most environments. We think we can do this while maintaining our debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the 1.0 to 1.5 times range. The amount of share repurchase activity will vary based on our cash flow generation, needs for working capital and other capital needs. We would be comfortable going to as high as three times debt-to-EBITDA for the right investment opportunity. For the quarter, we distributed approximately 98% of our net income to shareholders. We paid $57.3 million in cash dividends and spent $47.3 million repurchasing shares.","With that, I will turn it back to John for our closing prepared comments.","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sharing our thoughts on slide 14, regarding A Look Ahead. I know maybe the most impactful statement that probably everybody has focused on is in our 2015 outlook that our April to-date total company net revenue has increased approximately 6% per business day when compared to April of last year. I made a few comments relative to this earlier around our margin comparisons and how they are changing. The most impactful change when we look at our slowing net revenue growth in April compared to the overall growth rate for the first quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we have a decline in our net revenue per shipment of North America truckload given the change in margin comparison that I referenced earlier.","I also commented that we are seeing some acceleration in our volume growth during the month of April. But again, it's very early, it's very difficult to forecast and predict what the market will be like. But to a large degree, we see 2015 playing out much as we had anticipated that as we got into the March and April timeframe that our comparisons would get more difficult. We did not necessarily anticipate a decline in our net revenue per shipment. But the fact that the margins were fairly healthy a year ago, it's not surprising to us that we would be where we're at from a pricing standpoint today, with a much more modest increase year-over-year in April on contracted or committed business.","I also commented that we have seen a fairly soft spot market for the last couple of weeks. That can change quickly at any point in time. But based upon what we have seen thus far in April, we have gotten off to a soft start for the first part of April.","Beyond sharing that data point with you, I guess the other thing that we would like to emphasize is some of the areas of focus for us in 2015. I already commented and want to reiterate that Freightquote performance did achieve our objectives in the first quarter and we feel very good about the cultural fit and the integration initiatives that we have going on throughout 2015.","We talked a lot over the last couple of years about our integration of Phoenix International and the significant effort that was involved with merging more than 25 offices, the systems conversion work around the world, and a lot of personnel decisions that needed to be made around blending teams of 3,500 people across the world. The Freightquote acquisition does have some meaningful integration projects around segmentation and sharing leads and making sure that we capitalize on the efficiency of small customer activity that Freightquote brings to us as well as leveraging some of the really good technology that the Freightquote business has. However, with all of that business being located in primarily one location in Kansas City, there is not the same SG&A impact or risk or complexity around merging things that will take several years for us to do. So while we'll be working on the technology plan and some of the account management strategies over the next several years, the integration effort is quite a bit different than what we discussed in our global forwarding business.","In terms of sales and account management initiatives, this is something that we believe is a competitive strength for Robinson. I already mentioned our go-to-market initiatives as we've grown and diversified our business, it's important that we segment our offerings and are as efficient as we can be in how we approach our large and complex customers as well as our smaller and transactional customers. We have a lot of initiatives underway that intertwine with the Freightquote acquisition around our go-to-market activities and focused on how we believe that we can better penetrate our customers across each segment. Cross-selling initiatives like the example of global forwarding and domestic freight, cross-selling initiatives with our managed services, and evolving a lot of our transportation relationships into more integrated supply chain solution type relationships are at a core part of that account management and sales initiatives that we're working on.","So we do feel good about our investments in those initiatives. We talk about people, process and technology being the core investments, the process part of account management and how we go to market, it is a very important part of what we think will help us maintain our competitive advantage and our market leadership position.","Technology development, process efficiency, and network optimization, touched on this in a few different ways before, but we have a meaningful increase to our investment this year in our technology platform, the Navisphere platform that encompasses all of our services and allows us to share information and share freight across our network as well as integrating activities with our more complex customers to work on supply chain solutions.","All of our different service areas have a number of efficiency goals in our industry. There's a challenge that you need to add talent and you need to add people in order to grow and service your customers, but at the same time, there's a balance of efficiency and leveraging productivity across your systems and across your teams that we're very committed to as well too.","We have a theme of balanced growth internally in our people, process and technology where we're very focused on trying to balance the talent commitments and the hiring with leveraging the technology and the efficiency investments that we're making.","Lastly, I talked about people already, but acquiring and developing the best industry talent that we can find, we believe that has been and remains a competitive advantage for us. We are growing our workforce. If you look sequentially, we have added people above and beyond the Freightquote team and we do expect to continue that throughout the remainder of 2015.","Chad talked about our variable personnel expenses driven by the growth of our business. We do feel that despite being able to add to our team throughout the remainder of 2015, that our operating expense comparisons will actually be more favorable as the year wears on given the changes in variable expenses. So, it's important that we're investing in acquiring top talent. We're spending more on training than ever, and making sure that we maintain the best team in the industry.","That's the end of our prepared comments, so I will stop there and turn it over to Tim to facilitate our Q&A session.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks, John. And before I begin with the questions to John and Chad, I just want to thank everybody for submitting some great questions. We've made every effort to capture the key themes and get as many in as we can here. And if we do not have time to cover all of the questions that you've asked, please feel free to give me a call and we can review those in a phone call to follow up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","So, I'll get right into this here. And the first question is to John around truckload volume in Freightquote. So the question reads, with truckload volume without Freightquote up 3.0% year-over-year, will acquisitions always be required to boost volume growth sufficiently to support the 7.0% to 12% long-term EPS growth target over the course of the freight cycle or can organic growth ramp up through additional hiring, training systems \u2013 efforts, et cetera?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Our long-term EPS growth target of 7% to 12% that we outlined in our Investor Day deck a couple of years ago contemplated organic growth for us to achieve that. I mentioned earlier that we have seen some acceleration in April of our North American truckload volume and we do have confidence that we can achieve those longer-term targets primarily through organic growth. Freightquote is a good example of where we did find an opportunity to acquire and create a lot more volume in our system. We try to be very fair about highlighting that activity as separate and above and beyond what our organic growth targets are. So, we will continue to look for acquisitions, but our core 7% to 12% EPS growth, we believe, will be primarily driven by organic growth.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Okay. Thanks, John. A follow-up for you. Can you elaborate on the revenue and cost synergies via the Freightquote acquisition as they've begun to develop?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","From a revenue standpoint, our primary synergies are around the segmentation strategies. We talked about Freightquote having systems and processes that were geared to be very efficient with small customers, everything from the data entry and the pricing and quoting techniques so that a customer can get information very quickly and in a very automated way through their e-commerce solutions. So, our primary revenue synergy is about segmentation and making sure that we're using the right account management practices to most effectively approach the market.","If you look at it from a net revenue margin standpoint, we think the primary synergy opportunity is in the truckload sector around utilizing the C.H. Robinson network to more effectively and efficiently provide truckload services to those small customers that Freightquote has, as well as additional small customers and penetrating that segment in the marketplace.","From an operating expense standpoint, there are some opportunities to leverage a broader infrastructure and some of the costs, but the principal investment around people and operating expenses has limited synergy opportunity. So, the real upside for us is to penetrate the market more effectively and improve our margins over time by being more effective in our account management practices.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks John. Next question is for Chad. Was the Freightquote acquisition dilutive or accretive in the first quarter? How should we think about the accretion progression going forward?","Chad M. Lindbloom - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Information Officer","Freightquote was slightly accretive for the first quarter, just over $0.01. That includes the operations of the business, less the $1.9 million of amortization expense we mentioned, as well as the incremental financing cost to pay for the purchase price. Similar to Robinson, quarter two through quarter four are stronger in net revenues than earnings historically for Freightquote.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks Chad. Next question for John. For your first quarter presentation, April truckload net revenues are up 6.0% year-over-year. And the question reads truckload just for clarification, it was total company net revenues up 6.6%. That's my added commentary, not in the question. If Freightquote added seven points to total net revenue growth in first quarter and we assume the contribution was fairly steady in April, this would imply that you've seen a slight decline in organic net revenue growth so far in the second quarter. Is this the case? If so, what are the main drivers of the deceleration from the first quarter into early 2Q? How to your year-over-year net revenue comparisons trend through the second quarter?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","With the correction that Tim made, that is an accurate statement. So, total company net revenues that are up approximately 6% and that does include Freightquote, which means that the balance of the legacy activity is approximately flat. As I stated earlier, the primary reason for that decline in net revenue growth is a reduction in our net revenue per shipment in our North American truckload results.","Offsetting that, we have actually had some increase in our truckload volume activity and we have had growth in our other services of net revenue, but not for the first several weeks of April, not to the extent that we had in our first quarter.","From a comparison standpoint, the net revenue per shipment in truckload a year ago remained fairly consistent through the second quarter, tapered off a little bit at the end. So from a comparison standpoint, in that core net revenue category, the comparisons or the prior-year activity will remain fairly constant and then taper down a little bit in June. I mentioned earlier that while we did anticipate it would be more difficult to grow our net revenue, as the year progressed throughout 2015, we also believe that our comparisons from an operating expense standpoint, largely due to the increases in the previous year around variable compensation, will make those comparisons slightly more favorable as we go forward.","So we have not given up on our goal this year of double-digit earnings per share growth. We know that we have to continue to invest in that volume and grow our business aggressively throughout the remainder of the year. I also touched earlier on the spot market activity. The part that's most difficult to predict is just what short-term demand and spot market activity will be like, really for all of our services, but again, North America truckload is the largest. We don't know where that will go, but we're hopeful that we will see some strengthening in those opportunities as the year progresses as well.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks John. Next question again for you. Over the last several years, you've made a very large freight forwarding acquisition and purchased a sizable LTL-focused truck broker, improving your scale considerably in both verticals. Yet you remain far smaller in both intermodal and contract logistics. Are these segment areas where you'd be willing to grow your platform via acquisition?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The answer is yes. I think we've been clear all along that while we want to be primarily focused on organic growth in our business that we are receptive to acquisitions in any of our service offering areas. We have been in the intermodal business for several decades and remain committed to growing that organically or through acquisition, depending upon what we see as the best path forward from the standpoint of growing our business and servicing our customers.","With all of the services that we offer, our belief is that our long-term competitive advantage is in the quality of our service and the quality of our people. And when we look at the acquisition opportunities, we want to make certain that we're not disrupting any of that service capability or continuity and that we have the time and focus to make sure that we improve our competitive position in the marketplace while doing it. So while we've been looking at opportunities in both intermodal and contract logistics, we haven't found what we thought was the right blend of value and integration capabilities to really improve our competitive positioning in the marketplace.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks John. Next question for Chad. Transportation net revenue margin expanded sequentially. How much of this was attributed to fuel versus positive pricing and\/or CHRW's ability to widen the spread between the buy and the sell rates?","Chad M. Lindbloom - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Information Officer","Transportation net revenue expanded approximately 100 basis points sequentially. Fuel drove a big part of that expansion as the decrease in the price of fuel accelerated in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. However, we also talked about earlier that our net revenue margins or profit per load increased as last year's quarter went on. So it is difficult really to measure the impact of the two separately. Quarter one is typically a stronger net revenue margin quarter than quarter for, as capacity is typically more available and demand is not as strong. It's hard to really be specific with what the balance was of fuel versus market sequentially. The addition of the Freightquote business also increased our net revenue margin as their business has a higher net revenue margin since it has a stronger focus on LTL net revenues.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks Chad. The next question for John. Can you discuss the trends in prices that CHRW is able to obtain and how they differ between committed contracts and the spot market?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll repeat some of the metrics that I shared earlier from a customer pricing standpoint that throughout the first quarter of 2015, in January, prices were increased on average double digits, by February, it was mid-single digits, by March and April, it's low single digits in terms of average price comparisons versus a year ago. That breaks down, again, the lines between committed or contractual and spot can be a little bit blurred. But what we're seeing from a committed pricing or contractual pricing standpoint this year would represent low-single-digit increases over the previous year. Some of our margin comparison or net revenue per shipment comparison challenges in the current period are also due to the changes in the spot market where there is much less opportunity for expedited or significant price increases in the current year compared to the previous year.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks, John. Next question for Chad. With respect to head count, can you provide an organic number? I believe Freightquote had approximately 1,000 employees which implies sequential growth of less than 1%, or was there some attrition at Freightquote offset by higher organic growth? How should we think about head count additions either sequentially or year-over-year going forward?","Chad M. Lindbloom - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Information Officer","You're right that Freightquote did add approximately 1,000 people. And that was accounted for sequentially compared to the fourth quarter, which, you are also correct that that leaves about 100 employees or 1% in organic head count. Going forward, we will be adding head count as the business requires. The pace of growth is hard to quantify. But as we have talked about many times in the past, we expect head count to grow approximately the same amount as volume growth going forward. So it will really depend on how much business activity we have to what the head count will grow.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks, Chad. Next question for John. Are you concerned about the amount of regulation either in the works or proposed and how it's likely to have an outsized impact on the small and medium carriers which are so integral to your capacity network? And then on the flip side, you've got the asset-based companies aggressively growing their own logistics arm, so how do you think about the changing mix of your capacity over the next few years with that as a backdrop?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","From a regulatory standpoint, over the past four years or five years, there has been a significant amount of change that have impacted the cost of capacity, everything from the hours of service to the safety regulations. And there is more regulation pending around onboard computers and other things that have continued to increase the cost of capacity as a trade-off for some of the safety features or initiatives and regulation that will hopefully make the roads safer. That has been a challenge for our entire industry and for us to understand and pass through those clauses and help our customers understand why those cost increases may be disproportionate to average prices in the marketplace.","There has been discussion about whether or not those costs will disproportionately impact the medium and small carriers. It is possible that there is some incremental impact to those smaller carriers who -where maybe the larger carriers have voluntarily made some of those investments in the past, but we do believe that the regulations are being somewhat sympathetic to the cost part of it and the capital requirements of those capabilities will continue to get invested in and become more efficient in the marketplace. So while we see it as an overall challenge for us in our industry, we're not overly concerned about a disproportionate impact on medium and small carriers.","With regards to the competitive landscape and people investing in their own logistics division, that is part of the secular changes that we've talked about for the last four years, five years or more. The competitive landscape is changing with a number of carriers investing in brokerage or logistics divisions. We don't necessarily view that as a significant negative. In the longer run, we have belief that our third-party model of separating the capacity ownership and the capital investment from the customer service and go-to-market strategies can be a very effective way and the most effective way to serve a large part of the marketplace.","As others continue to invest in that business model and more of the marketplace gets served by a third-party or a logistics-type business model, we think that that just reflects some of the secular changes in how we're all competing. So the market is more competitive, we're adapting to how things are changing and with regards to the business model that each of our competitors pursues around a blend of capital and logistics type stuff, we'll just have to factor that in to how we sell and how we grow in the marketplace.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks, John. The next question again for you on the topic of intermodal. You mentioned recently and in the past that this is a difficult business to scale given its attractive growth profile as modal conversion is driving market growth faster than GDP. Why isn't CHRW doing more to penetrate this business more aggressively? Would this be an area where more aggressive M&A makes sense?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is a question that we get often. And we are open to M&A investments in the intermodal space. As people know and we've talked in the past, the business model in a lot of the intermodal activity is a more capital-intensive business model, with container equipments as well as (44:30) investments. We have made some of those container investments ourselves and we are committed to organic growth of our customer relationships. We have to do that in conjunction with the rail partners and make sure that our growth aspirations and investments align with their strategies around pricing and market share gains.","So, it's a complicated landscape from the standpoint that it involves more complexity of capital investments and fewer carrier partners that you have to align with in terms of their strategy. But it is an area that we're committed to, it's an area or that we're investing our own capital in, and it's an area that we are receptive to opportunities around acquisition, if we can find the right blend of all that.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks, John. Next question for Chad. Please identify the aggregate amount of any onetime deal-related cost, if material, for Freightquote.","Chad M. Lindbloom - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Information Officer","Sure. Most acquisition-related costs were in the fourth quarter, and in total, the deal-related expenses were relatively modest. We did not use an investment bank to help us with this transaction, which tends to be the most expensive part of one-time deal expenses. First quarter deal-related costs were insignificant and there have been no significant severance costs to-date.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks, Chad. And next question is for John. How did your net revenue growth trend month-to-month through the first quarter?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In the first quarter of 2015, both January and February, net revenue growth was significant double-digit growth. In the month of March, that net revenue growth tapered off to low single digits, and in the month of April, it's fairly consistent with the month of March, with some \u2013 little bit more deceleration in the net revenue per shipment for truckload. So as I commented earlier, sequentially, our business activity and pricing activity is more stable than it may appear. The net revenue decline is primarily due to truckload net revenue per shipment comparisons.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks, John. Next question again for you. What percentage of Freightquote's LTL customer base is using CHRW's truck brokerage services? Where do you see this number going forward?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Because Freightquote has a very broad customer base of small transactional customers with tens of thousands of them, it's difficult to be very precise, but we're relatively convinced that there are very few customer overlaps in our customer base. There are several hundred that we're aware of that we've had to do some account management coordination, but a very small percentage of the total customer base.","We believed at the time of the deal and believe even stronger today that one of the primary growth opportunities is to increase the truck service exposure and activity to that small customer base at Freightquote and to do a better job of penetrating the small business and small customer opportunities out there with both LTL and truckload opportunities. So very little overlap today and a growth opportunity that we expect to be focused on and investing in over the years to come.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks, John. Next question again for you. Could you give us a sense of how concentrated your customer exposure is in the intermodal business and then also the ocean business?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","If you look at C.H. Robinson as a whole or within any of our individual service offerings, we think one of the strengths is that we have a very diversified customer base. From an enterprise standpoint, we have a lot of customers that are around the 1% net revenue, and we've shared before from an enterprise standpoint that our top 100 customers are around a third of the business and that our top 300 or 400 customers make up around half of the business. If you look at the individual modes, or our intermodal business, the top five or 10 customers, the top 10 customers are around 13% of our net revenue for intermodal. So, very similarly, we have a lot of customers in that 1.0% of net revenue even within the separate intermodal service line.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","And then the concentration in ocean as well?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So, similar question around customer concentration in ocean, same type of answer that if you look at our top 10 or 20 customers in our ocean business, it represents \u2013 the top 10 would represent somewhere less than 10% of our net revenue, and the top 20 would represent somewhere in the teens as a percentage of our net revenue, again, with many of the customers rounding up or down to around 1%. So, no individually significant customers for the enterprise or within our modes and that's part of that customer diversification that we feel is the strength of our business model.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Okay. Next question is for Chad, and it's a modeling question here. What is the expected CapEx and tax rate for the first quarter and the remainder of the year?","Chad M. Lindbloom - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Information Officer","For the first quarter, we gave the number for CapEx in the prepared comments, and the tax rate was 38.2%. As far as our expectations for the year on CapEx, we still believe we'll be in about the $40 million to $50 million range for the year, with part of that being the data center that we talked about earlier. The tax rate on an ongoing basis, we expect to be between about 38.25% and 38.75%.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks, Chad. Next question for John. Why the big improvement in sourcing revenues and margins? And how sustainable is that?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The big improvement is primarily related to difficult conditions from a year ago, both with weather and margin volatility and some lost customer business that we referenced a year ago. We do believe that we can continue to grow our sourcing net revenues during the year. But as we've always shared, that business tends to be more volatile depending upon the cycles of crops and the availability of volumes for us to distribute and sell to our customers. But our growth this year is what we believe is the return to more normalized margins and activity in our sourcing activity.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks, John. Next question for you. Could you please address end market dynamics and your confidence in continued business momentum in the second quarter of 2015?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I've commented a couple of times that the primary issue we feel today is a much different comparison to our 2014 results. From a sequential standpoint, while the spot market activity is not nearly as robust as we've seen a year ago, our committed volumes are consistent and growing. And we do feel like there is continued growth activity for us. Our growth plan is to add people and to continue to go after share. We have success in integrating our acquisitions that we've talked about and do feel like we can continue to take share for the remainder of the year and grow our business. So who knows where the spot market will go? And I think we've shared often, it's very difficult to forecast or model our business, so we never know with certainty. But we do feel that we can continue to grow our business throughout the remainder of 2015.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks, John. Next question again for you. Customers seem more interested in securing capacity and minimizing their spot exposure. So can you talk about your spot versus contractual mix during the first quarter? How you think that will trend going forward, and what impact that likely will have on your margins? Are you still looking to keep a 50-50 balance between spot and contracted business? Can you also break down how contractual versus spot trended during the quarter and what you expect the second quarter and second half to be?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","A lot of questions in there. I don't know that I can answer them all specifically. But if you look at the overall trend over a longer period of time, several decades ago, we were almost 100% transactional with just all of our business being very spot market and real-time in the marketplace.","The longer-term trend is that we've become more engaged with committed or contracted customers and a greater and greater percentage of our volume is pre-priced or pre-committed as we've become not only a transactional broker, but also a 3PL core carrier that is dealing with dedicated capacity and committed shippers in a more committed and pre-priced way. If you look at the volatility in the truckload market over the last several years, it is true that many of those large shippers are as desirous as ever to pre-pricing or committing as much of their freight as possible from a pricing standpoint because of situations like a year ago where the market volatility demanded a significant premium to get access to that spot market capacity and shippers rightly don't want to have exposure to those types of cost variances or cost increases. So while we have this period of sustained shortage and market tightness on the truckload side, it probably is the case that more shippers will continue to want to contract for more and more of their capacity and we are working hard to provide those solutions in the marketplace by working on those committed bids and our business will probably continue to increase as a percentage of that activity.","The spot market business comes and goes depending upon how the market behaves. When the market has a lot of demand and a lot of route guide failure like it did a year ago, you'll see significant increases in that spot market activity. When it calms down and stabilizes more like it is now, we'll see a meaningful decline in that spot market. So, our business mix and portfolio mix changes as a result of the market activity more so than anything specifically that we're targeting.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Okay. Thanks, John. Again, for you. Next question. Can you comment on the competitive environment in truck brokerage? The spot market still looks relatively healthy compared to history, but less robust than a year ago. How does that impact the rationality of your peers in using more aggressive price to go after market share and how has considered consolidation in the space impacted the business? Then how do you think about \u2013 how do you think it'll impact the pricing environment and margin outlook going forward?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","When we look at the various impacts on our business of competition and longer-term secular changes versus the short-term cycles, the industry consolidation and the activity that's happening is very relevant, but it's probably more in terms of its longer-term impact. I think in the acquisitions we've made and when we look at our competitors, it takes a period of years to really get traction around cross-selling initiatives and more effectively going in the market together and sharing capacity. So from the standpoint of how is the competitive landscape today versus a year ago, our principal data points around that are the overall demand of freight and the overall change in the supply and demand and route guide compliance that we're adjusting to. There have been a lot of people aggressively investing in market share and there has been an increase in acquisitions, which certainly over time will change how competitors are leveraging scale and how people are going to market with different pricing strategies, but nothing that we can really observe in the short term around this year versus last year or today versus a couple of months ago.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Okay. Thanks, John. Next question is for Chad. Depreciation and amortization is now on a $65 million annual run rate. Please discuss your expectations for 2015 D&A. How much is amortization related to Phoenix and Freightquote and how much is depreciation?","Chad M. Lindbloom - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Information Officer","The Freightquote amortization added approximately $1.9 million and that's what we expected to be per quarter. Phoenix acquisition, purchase price related amortization is about $4.1 million per quarter. In addition to that, there's about $100,000 from other miscellaneous acquisitions that happened previous to Phoenix.","For depreciation, Freightquote added approximately $1 million per quarter to our depreciation expense. As we talked about in the Freightquote acquisition conference call, they do own \u2013 or we now own a building down there which makes up a large part of that depreciation period.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Thanks, Chad. Next question for John. Has your length of haul continued to decrease? Is this a conscious effort on the part of CHRW or something more customer-driven? Is it similar to trends you're seeing in the market or company-specific?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We do believe that the marketplace as a whole has seen some shortening in the average length of haul in the truckload sector due to more local growing and local sourcing activities and just the shrinking of the supply chain over the last couple of years. We believe our business is reflective of the marketplace in that as we've pursued more outsourced relationships and more integrated activities where we manage all of the freight, we believe that we've been more aggressively going after components of freight that would include short-haul activity. So it's a combination of a broader trend in the marketplace as well as our go-to-market and sales strategies that has us penetrating the shorter length of haul component of the market more aggressively in the last several years.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor & Media Relations","Okay. Thank you, John. And unfortunately, we're out of time and we couldn't get to all the questions today, and we apologize for that.","Timothy D.

Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) Q3 2016 Earnings Call October 26, 2016  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, Tim Gagnon will facilitate a review of previously-submitted questions. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, October 26, 2016.","I will now turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, the Director of Investor Relations.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everybody. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Clarke, our Chief Financial Officer. John and Andy will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our third quarter and we will follow that with a response to the pre-submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday. Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate the discussion. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Andy will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments.","I'd like to remind you that comments made by John, Andy or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","With that, I'll turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments on slide 3 with a review of our third quarter results.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Tim. I'm going to start by referencing a few of our key financial metrics on that slide 3. Total revenues of $3.3 billion for the quarter were down 1.9% compared to last year. Total net revenues of $558 million were down 5% from a year ago. Income from operations of $211 million was down 9% from a year ago and our earnings per share of $0.90 compares to $0.96 a year ago or a 6% decline. Year-to-date earnings per share of $2.73 is up 4% from $2.63 a year ago.","Despite some quarterly decreases in some of our key financial metrics, we do believe that we're making good progress towards achieving our long-term goals. I want to start my prepared comments by discussing a few of the themes that impacted both our third quarter results, but also reflect the progress that we're making on those long-term goals.","First topic I want to start with is margin compression. On our second quarter call we discussed the fact that in the months of June and July our net revenue had begun to decline due to margin compression. Unfortunately, that margin compression carried on through the third quarter and impacted our results for the third quarter of 2016.","Most all of our services had margin decreases versus a year ago during the third quarter, but the point that we want to emphasize is that our margins are within the ranges of what we expect in our long-term planning and we do accept the cyclicality of our markets as one of the things that we have to manage. A big part of the 3PL value, particularly with our committed relationships, is managing the cycles and managing the price variations and margin compression that can occur in the marketplace, and we do feel that we did a good job this quarter of honoring our committed relationships and servicing our customers in a way that was very valuable to the market.","So we talk a lot about margin compression internally and you'll hear a lot about margin compression on the call today impacting our results.","The next topics regard to market share gains and volumetrics. Andy will cover and you will see a lot of metrics throughout our presentation about shipper growth and volume growth in our freight activity as well as share gains in most of our services. We've talked in the past that in a lot of ways this is one of the most important metrics in our business as we have to make sure that we remain relevant in providing increased service levels to our customers and our carrier providers. We'll share the metrics around our shipment activity as well as our capacity sign-up. We feel pretty good about the relevancy of our network in the marketplace and the fact that carrier sign-ups are at very high levels, and the services that we're offering around all the choices that those carriers have to interact with our network via mobile application or the Internet or telephone calls or any way that that capacity deems the right way to interact with our network.","So we did have market share gains and volume growth in a lot of our metrics that we'll share today, and that's something that we continue to feel very good about as a foundation for continuing to add value.","When we think about the margin compression and the relationship to the volume gains and the market share achievements that we've had, we also talked about the fact that we knew we were coming into this year with some challenging comparisons. There is a relationship between volume and margin in the second half of 2014 and 2015. We did have some very good results with double-digit net revenue and earnings per share growths in both of those periods of time. And we've talked in the past that our portfolio of business, the vast majority of it, does reprice on an annual basis and when we think about going after those market share gains and that volume activity, it's important that we're successful doing that during the periods of margin compression and when prices are cycling down, because the market is very fluid, and as I said earlier a lot of our business reprices on an annual basis.","So overall, when you put those three things together, we had challenging comparisons coming into the year, the market cycled down, creating some margin compression, but we feel very good about our network, our relevancy to our shippers and our capacity providers and the fact that we were able to achieve some good volume growth and market share gains.","Just a couple of other topics that I want to highlight before I turn it over to Andy, again things that both impacted the third quarter as well as topics that are important to our long-term success. We do continue to invest in the most important part of our network which is our people. We had around a 5% increase in our head count from the third quarter versus a year ago, and as we invest in those people, we continue to feel very confident about the job families that we have and our approach of how we go to market to make those people successful.","You'll see that we did have a decrease in personnel costs due to the variable nature of our business model, so that despite the fact that we're continuing to invest in the people that we need to execute our services, we also feel our model is working with regards to how it reacts during different environments.","The caliber of our people are extremely important, and we've talked in the past that the additions of head count do tend to correlate more with volume and shipment activities than our net revenue growth. So this again in the third quarter reflects our ongoing investment in our network by hiring people and investing in the future capabilities of that network.","The last topic I would touch on is the acquisition of APC that closed on September 30. In terms of the third quarter impact it's really mostly the balance sheet numbers that you'll see because of closing on the last day of the quarter. However, it's an important part of our long-term plan that we continue to look at our capital strategies and invest in our network through the right types of M&A activity that we feel can enhance our network.","We feel really good about this acquisition from a variety of perspectives. We had a long operating history with APC through the Phoenix relationship and working as an agent. We feel very good about the cultural compatibility and the capability of the company. There were some very positive things that Andy and his team did around the structure and the capital deployment to make sure that we're reinvesting our capital outside of the United States just like we had represented that we intended to do. So that also is another important element of how we invested in our network during the quarter and believe that we're positioning ourselves for good success in terms of achieving those long-term goals.","Those are some of the overall highlights of impact on the quarter that I wanted to share with you, and with that, I will turn it over to Andy to walk through the results by service area.","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, John, and now on to slide four and our Transportation results. As John mentioned, we anticipated a challenging pricing and execution environment coming into the second half of this year, and knew last year's comparables would be difficult. Our people and our network did a great job managing through the environment by being proactive and serving customers in order to be the provider of choice at a time when routing guides are performing largely as planned.","Total Transportation revenues were down slightly in the quarter to just under $3 billion. However, total revenues were up on a year-over-year basis in both August and September and that positive trend has continued into October. The growth month-to-date in October is a result of our significant volume improvements as well as the fact that fuel is normalizing on a year-over-year basis.","In October our truckload volumes are up over 12%, clearly outperforming the market. Transportation net revenue margin decreased approximately 80 basis points from last year's third quarter. Though below last year, this margin is on the upper end of our historical third quarter margins over the last five years to six years. The decreased net revenue margin was primarily the result of truckload pricing falling more than purchased transportation costs, impacting margins by approximately 140 basis points. That decrease was partially offset by the positive impact of fuel of approximately 20 basis points and in a change of our mix of services of approximately 40 basis points.","As we did in last quarter's presentation, we have included slide five which provides a longer historical perspective of pricing and cost, and the respective impact on our margins and results.","On this graph, the light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in North America truckload rate per mile to customers and carriers, net of fuel costs over time. The orange line is the net revenue margin for all transportation services. You can see by looking at the light and dark blue lines that in this year's third quarter there is a separation where the rate of change in our price to customers fell faster than the rate paid to carriers. In last year's third quarter in comparison, the opposite was true, where our costs were falling at a faster rate than price.","This chart also highlights the volatility of our business. This year's third quarter also represents the first time in nine quarters where the cost line was above the price line, which has impacted business results over the past couple of years.","One of the many things our customers ask us to do is provide contractual rates and access to capacity to avoid some of the highs and lows of the markets, so that they're better able to plan their transportation spend. There are times when this contractual commitment will benefit our results and other times when they will not. Our ability to provide this type of service is one of the reasons shippers choose Robinson as a core provider in their businesses.","During the quarter our committed or contractual business represented approximately 62% of our truckload volume which is in line with the past several quarters. We often speak about the uncertainty of how the market will perform looking ahead. We're not sure if we have reached the bottom of the decreased pricing environment that we have seen this year, but the third quarter did see some improvement in pricing. We don't feel like there's been a big change in the market as demand continues to be tepid, but things do seem a little bit better sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter today.","Moving on to slide six and our truckload results, truckload net revenues were $309 million, a decrease of 10.4% in the third quarter. Truckload volumes, however, increased 7.5% and this growth was the result of an increase in shipments across all of our services from dry van, flatbed to temperature-controlled. We also saw our volume increase \u2013 growth across all of our mileage vans from short to long-haul segments.","As mentioned earlier, for the first time in nine quarters customer pricing was down more than carrier costs. Customer pricing net of fuel was down 5.5% versus last year's third quarter, and purchased transportation costs net of fuel was down 3.5%. We again added 4,200 new carriers in the third quarter. These new carriers moved nearly 18,000 shipments for us in the quarter.","As we look ahead to the remainder of the fourth quarter and into 2017, we don't expect a significant change in the North American market and we will remain focused on growing our volumes and executing a balanced approach to taking profitable market share.","Moving to slide seven and the less-than-truckload results. Net revenues in our LTL business grew 2.4% to $96.4 million. Volumes increased 5% when compared to the third quarter of last year. Pricing however was down slightly and net revenue margins held flat during the quarter. This quarter's growth slowed a bit when compared to the first two quarters of the year as the size of our shipments were down on a year-over-year basis and the lower-priced truckload market is having an impact on LTL demand. We continue to be confident in our leading position in LTL and our ability to offer a compelling solution for our customers.","Transitioning to our intermodal results on slide eight, intermodal net revenues decreased 24.5% in the quarter while volumes were approximately flat. As has been the case for four quarters, the overall intermodal market has been challenged by the loose truck market and volumes have suffered. We did achieve approximately 15% volume growth in the quarter with our large strategic customers. The trend has been positive for the past few quarters with these larger, more committed customers. The transactional opportunities, however, continue to be scarce, which is the primary reason for our net revenue decrease in the quarter. As we have mentioned in previous quarters, the lower truckload pricing is limiting the long-haul intermodal opportunities.","Moving on to the Global Forwarding business on slide nine, third quarter net revenues in our Global Forwarding services were $88.7 million, a 2.1% decrease from 2015's third quarter. Ocean net revenues were down 3.1%, air net revenues decreased 1.7%, while customs grew 2.6%. Ocean shipments increased approximately 5% in the quarter and pricing continue to be down with total revenue per shipment off double digits in the ocean service line. The pricing environment, especially in the Trans-Pacific lane did change in September as the result of the Hanjin bankruptcy filing. Hanjin is not a core carrier for Robinson so we were able to provide great service to our customers. I think what surprised us and the rest of the industry was the degree to which the remaining carriers raised their rates over the short term, sometimes as much as $750 to $900 per container. This situation did pressure our ocean margins in September and it took a few weeks for our account managers to revise pricing with customers.","As John mentioned earlier, we made an investment in the Global Forwarding business at the end of the quarter with the acquisition of APC Logistics. We are very excited to have APC as part of the Robinson Global Forwarding team. The addition of nine offices and 313 employees in Australia and New Zealand strengthens our global value proposition.","The integration is proceeding quickly and smoothly and we are excited about our combined ability to grow with their customers in Asia and Europe. We had a strong quarter growing air shipment volume approximately 18%. This has been a strategic focus for us and the double-digit volume increase is a result of an environment where demand is generally soft. Despite the strong volume growth, we continue to see weak pricing down double digits that led to a decrease in net revenue.","Moving to other logistic services on slide 10, net revenues increased 31% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period last year, led by the continued strong performance at TMC. The managed services business represents approximately 65% of the net revenue in this category. Managed services net revenue increased 29% in the third quarter and is currently on pace to service over $4 billion in freight under management in 2016.","The growth we are seeing in the managed services as a result of our global investments over the past decade. We are seeing double-digit growth in Europe, Asia, and South America, in addition to the 24% growth in North America. The managed services business leverages our Navisphere technology platform, providing visibility, control, and deep integration across supply chain partners while providing process management and consulting services to drive continuous improvement in our customer supply chains. Congratulations to the TMC and IT teams involved in onboarding Microsoft.","Transitioning to our sourcing business on slide 11, congratulations to the Robinson team for growing sourcing net revenues 4.7% in the third quarter. The net revenue growth was primarily the result of a 6.4% case volume growth offset by a decrease in net revenue per case. The 6.4% case growth was driven by strong performance in the foodservice segment and our strategic and key commodities.","I will now transition to slide 12 and a review of our summarized income statement. For the third quarter, operating expenses decreased 2.4% to $347 million. Personnel expenses decreased 2.7%, primarily driven by lower variable compensation incentives and partially offset by an average head count growth of 4.5% in the quarter. As John mentioned, we've been making strategic investments in head count throughout the year to grow volumes.","SG&A expenses decreased 1.6% in the third quarter primarily due to a lower provision for bad debt and lower claims in this year's third quarter when compared to the same period in 2015. The combined impact of these two expense items were approximately $6 million in the quarter. We are pleased with our credit and finance results as they reflect the quality of our customers and receivable balance.","Our operating income as a percent of net revenue was 37.8%, a decrease of 170 basis points from last year. Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 36.7% versus 38.5% last year. We did have a one-time tax benefit from an item related to the Freightquote acquisition that increased the earnings per share by approximately $0.01. The remainder of the improvement versus last year was the election of APB 23 in the first quarter of this year.","On to slide 13 and other financial information, we generated nearly $130 million in cash in the quarter and had just over $27 million in capital expenditures. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $377 million, and year-to-date capital expenditures were approximately $71 million reflecting the build-out of our second data center.","We finished the quarter with $224 million in cash, and our debt balance is $1.225 billion with $500 million at 4.28% and $725 million on the revolver with a current rate of 1.52%. The debt balance increased at the end of the quarter as we utilized the revolver for a portion of the purchase price of APC which closed on September 30.","And finally before turning it back to John, slide 14 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $130 million to shareholders in the quarter with $63 million in dividends and approximately $67 million in share repurchases. In the third quarter we returned 101% of our net income to shareholders, and year-to-date we have returned 86%.","Again, our thanks to everyone at Robinson for a solid third quarter in a challenging environment. Thank you all as well for listening in. With that, I will turn it back to John to make some closing comments before we answer some of your questions.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. In terms of wrapping up our prepared remarks on slide 15 with regards to our final comments, really the first two bullet points tie into the opening messages around margin compression and volume growth. As you see there, we continue to have strong North America truckload volume growth at 12% that Andy mentioned as well as some ongoing margin compression resulting in a net revenue decrease of approximately 4% per business day so far in October. Once again, we do have some strong comparisons from the fourth quarter of a year ago that we'll be dealing with that are helping make that net revenue growth a little bit more challenging. But overall the major themes carry forward in that we continue to feel very good about our service levels, the relevance our offering in the marketplace and the mixture of volume and margin compression that we're dealing with in the marketplace.","On the bottom of slide 15, just a couple of other topics to share a few thoughts with before we get into the Q&A. We've hit on this theme a couple of times but just wanted to share that we are very excited and feel really good about the initial interactions on APC integration. I mentioned earlier that we do have a long-standing relationship with them through our agency agreement. The companies of APC and Robinson have worked together successfully for a long time but integrating our businesses is going to provide yet another opportunity to share information and to kind of jointly market what we think is a more effective way. There are some agent relationships both within C.H. Robinson and APC that are transitioning during the fourth quarter of 2016, so there is a lot of activity associated with that, but we feel very good about our approach to the market and the progress that we're making on that thus far.","There will also be some additional IT integration that we'll be accomplishing in the next few quarters to come, but overall again just something that we feel very good: as the perfect type of network investment and capital allocation that we want to do to continue to strengthen our network, and wanted to share with you that we're off to a great start with some early customer wins and feeling about how we're progressing with that.","In addition, the results of APC are not included in the comments above with regards to the net revenue to date. So the results of APC when included in the fourth quarter hopefully will improve our net revenue by a couple of percent. We do believe the acquisition will be modestly accretive going forward in each of the periods.","The last bullet point on here about confidence in our network is something that we talk about frequently, but I think it's worth mentioning to just call out again both the confidence that we do have in our team and the relevance of the 3PL model. When you think about the changes in the marketplace and the lack of predictability that happens within the transportation marketplace, some of the things that just sort of go unnoticed at times are things like a significant hurricane in the southeast this quarter, the large ocean carrier bankruptcy that was mentioned and all of the rerouting and service opportunities that had to come from that. There's every quarter some good examples of how the 3PL model and how the Robinson network really plays an important role in the marketplace to absorb some of that volatility and improve services and react to a lot of the things that happen in the marketplace that are important to the shippers and the providers out there that we do that.","So just wanted to close again by saying that there's a lot of change going on, there's going to be a lot of pricing activity, there's a lot of volume happening in the network, a lot of changes, and we just feel really good about our network and our ability to react and succeed in any of those environments and re-establishing the value and relevance of our network to the marketplace.","So with that, that concludes our prepared comments, and I would like to turn it back to Tim to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Mr. Gagnon, the floor is yours for the question-and-answer session.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Donna, and thanks to the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions. I'll frame up the questions as they were submitted and turn it over to John and Andy for a response. And with that, let's get right into it.","The first question is for John. The number one concern I continue to hear from investors or potential investors is margins are high. Why shouldn't I be more concerned about margins going down in the coming quarters?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So hopefully our prepared comments gave some light to addressing this issue, but I want to repeat some of it because it is very important and foundational to how we approach things. If you start with the long-term perspective, part of what we have said is that we accept the cyclicality and the margin expansion and compression that happens in our model, particularly as we move into more committed relationships where we have fixed pricing on the shipper side for a period of time and often more transactional or fluid procurement costs.","So it's very fundamental as we said in the prepared comments to how we approach the market and how we try to add value. And the way we think about margin expansion and compression is kind of monitoring it over the long term to make sure that we're within the parameters and boundaries of what we've set as expectations around how things are going to cycle. So from a long-term perspective we don't get concerned when we see margin expansion and compression, we just focus on our business processes and making sure that we're reacting, and what we think is the proper way to make sure that we're adjusting much along the chart that Andy talked us through around how customer pricing and carrier pricing are changing and making sure that those blue lines stay close together over time to manage that.","So from a long-term perspective, we're not concerned about it in terms of it happening because we do plan for it and it's part of our business model. From a short-term perspective we are concerned about it. We have a lot of things that we do to adjust pricing and a lot of management processes that are very focused on making sure that we are adapting and managing prices and we talk about comparisons and we try to share as much as we can about what is happening with margin compression or margin expansion. So hopefully we shared what we know about that and whether or not somebody should be more or less concerned about it, in the short-term, I think we're doing all that we can to manage through it and the long-term we feel like it's part of our business model that we've dealt with for decades.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. The next question for Andy. Any chance you have net revenue by month for the third quarter?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. And these are on a per business day basis; July ended down 3%, August was softer, declining 7% for the month on a per day basis and September recovered a bit but was still down 5%. What's interesting about September was, and as we mentioned this, the growth of our Global Forwarding business was challenged in the month particularly September by the Hanjin bankruptcy and the subsequent carrier rate increases that negatively impacted our net revenue for that service line.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. The next question for John, a two-part question. First part, how did total company net revenue trend year over year by month in the fourth quarter of 2015? And then the second part, when are your contractual agreements typically renegotiated?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So starting with the numbers last year in the fourth quarter of 2015, our net revenues grew 14% in October, 15% in November, and 12% in December. So that's the month by month of the double-digit net revenue growth that I mentioned from a year ago that we're comparing to. You may also remember that those 2015 numbers did have some Freightquote growth in there that I think we quantified at about 3% contribution to the growth but still double digit without the acquisition of Freightquote from a year ago. So that's month by month and the growth that we referenced with regards to the comparisons coming into this quarter in 2016.","When are the contractual agreements typically renegotiated? We've talked about this quite a bit. So, most of the contracts will have 30 day outs for either side so that there's an expectation of an annual commitment from a pricing standpoint and typically with 30-day notice from either party in terms of if you want to terminate the arrangement. The vast majority of the business gets repriced when a shipper originates a new bid process to take a look at that price or when the providers come up and say that they can no longer service the business under those price arrangements. We do have a disproportionate amount of bid activity typically in the springtime, so there's more of an annual cycle to that. So as we said in our prepared comments, we are constantly looking at pricing, looking at committed arrangements versus transactional arrangements. There's always bid activity happening in the marketplace and we'll see more of it around year end and in the springtime as everybody looks at their pricing arrangements and thinks about what's appropriate going forward.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. Can you quantify the impact the Hanjin bankruptcy had on your ocean forwarding business in the quarter? Do you anticipate this margin squeeze will be short-lived? Or is this something that could linger for couple of quarters until capacity re-enters the market?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yes. Hanjin filed on August 31 and what happened shortly thereafter is the other carriers that remained in the Trans-Pacific eastbound lane began to raise rates. I think what happened then shortly thereafter was that they doubled them. They were up as high as $750 as I mentioned earlier, $750 to $900 a box. Now, we weren't able to immediately pass those rate increases along to our customers. As I mentioned, our account managers are out there right now having those discussions with our customers to reflect the rates that are now in place in that trade lane. We would expect the impact to trickle into the fourth quarter, but not much beyond that.","As far as the quantification, to give you an idea, we were growing volumes, and net revenue was fine in our ocean trade lane in July and August. However, September on a net revenue basis was down 15% overall in our ocean business, to give you an idea of how much those rate increases impacted the ocean trade lane.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. What was the driver of the need to drop prices to customers so rapidly in the third quarter of 2016? Why weren't truckload carriers willing to absorb price reductions? And was it the shippers' desire to share more of the cost reductions that had been accruing to C.H. Robinson over the past year to year and a half? And was pushback from carriers suggesting that they had an alternative source of freight?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So, there's a lot of good questions in there, really all sort of centering around the bid process and the pricing expectations. And I guess one of the things to reiterate is that very much like earnings season, part of the challenge in this is that there's an element of what's expected versus what's actually occurring.","When you come into a year like 2016 we've mentioned a couple of times that shipper expectations were generally for fairly meaningful price reductions. So if you look at bid activity a year ago, these bids typically have lots of parties, they're very efficient, there might be multiple rounds of electronic bidding and it's not any one person or any one expectation, but there's a consensus that comes out of those bid processes around what a shipper is expecting and how the market responds to it.","A year ago there were many bid activities that achieved mid single or high single-digit rate decreases as a result of those bid processes. You can see during our third quarter here we had a 5.5% decrease in terms of the pricing that we charge to shippers.","As the year goes on then, what we're experiencing is a more fluid or transactional procurement of a lot of those truckload costs. So while during the quarter they were down 3.5%, they were not down the 5.5% that was achieved in a lot of the committed bid relationships that we worked with on the shipper side.","So, when we get into the third quarter and we have committed pricing from bids and you mix that in with a current transactional market that again is softer than a year ago, but maybe not quite as soft as people expected, that's when those blue lines on our margin graph get some separation and we see the margin compression.","So, really the bottom if you will or the tipping point that may have occurred during the second and third quarter of this year is really a function not so much of prices starting to go up versus a year ago, but cost increases being more than were expected when a lot of those committed relationships were entered into.","So, it's challenging, it's part of the reason why it's difficult to predict because you're dealing with a lot of changes in the marketplace and the management of expectations and bid processes versus what then ultimately occurs. But as I said in the previous question, we view it as one of our strengths that we have the types of account management processes and relationships to adjust to how the market does actually change, and we focus on that 10-year graph of showing that over time we've been very successful by making sure that our pricing relationships and our cost relationships do adjust together.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. To Andy with the next question, would you anticipate the tax rate remaining in the 37% range or returning closer to the historical level of 38%?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Our tax rate will remain below the historical tax rate of 38.5%. And the primary reason for that is at the beginning of this year we elected APB 23 which means that we will permanently leave non-U.S. earnings outside of the United States. We will also then redeploy those earnings in areas outside of the United States. The APC deal is a great example of this relocation of capital because Australia's corporate tax rate is 30% which is lower than U.S. tax rate.","So, as more of our earnings are generated outside of the United States, the effective tax rate will go down. Mind you, we still generate a significant amount of our earnings and net income inside the United States, but as more capital is deployed outside of the United States where the tax rates are lower, the effective tax rate of our organization will continue to go down. So we do expect it to be below the 38.5% into the range of 37%.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. What are your plans for head count for the rest of 2016? Should we expect head count to grow in 2017?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","A couple of things to remember there, I think it was mentioned already but with the closing on September 30, we will have the 300-some APC employees that will come in or are in the numbers I guess but will be factored into kind of our productivity metrics and average head count for the fourth quarter of 2016. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, because we do look at our hiring practice as very much correlated around volume and growth of shipment metrics, we do expect to continue to add to our team in the remainder of 2016 and likely going into 2017 as well.","When we have periods of margin compression we do get a little bit more conservative in terms of thinking about our headcounts, and just like so far this year where we've had head count growth less than our volume growth, I would expect that in Q4 in 2017 as well too. The combination of productivity initiatives, using technology to automate and just managing our expectations more aggressively when we're in a period of margin compression, all of those lead to probably slightly more conservative hiring practices. However, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, when we feel good about the market share gains that we're having and investing in the network, we will continue to look at how we build out our team and add to it.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy, what is the catalyst for the acceleration in the North America truckload volume growth in October? How sustainable do you view double-digit truckload volume growth to be?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","The short answer is we have a highly motivated, talented and aggressive North American surface transportation team and we happen to think they're the best in the business. They know what they need to do in markets like these because they've been through it before. The longer answer I think reflects and relates to what John and I both mentioned earlier, which is what we viewed as shippers' expectations going into this year as demand slackened and capacity loosened. Our people are in front of our customers every day and staying relevant to them. Now, are we making as much as we did last year? No, but that's part of our business model and part of the cycle. As to the sustainability, well that depends. We'll emphasize as we always have balance and profitable growth.","I just want to like take a step back for moment and reflect on some of our key year-to-date performances. Truckload volumes up 5% and that's off of a very large base, LTL volume is up 7% again off a very large base, ocean volumes up 6%; we're still the number one NVOCC from China to the U.S. Our air volume is up 18%, managed services revenues up 29% and sourcing volumes up 6% \u2013 pardon me; 7%. The point is that while this quarter is not stellar, I think it's helpful to take a slightly longer-term view and look at the trends as well.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. To John with the next question. Can you please give us your thoughts on the outlook for the forwarding business overall? How are margins trending? And which trade lanes provide the most opportunity for CHRW?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","We've not wavered at all on our overall view that our forwarding business is in a great spot right now and we continue to have a very positive longer-term outlook. And we've all discussed the fact that ocean pricing in many of the lanes had dropped down to levels that clearly were not sustainable for the steam ship lines. The fact that a bankruptcy occurred fairly abruptly and prices moved somewhat abruptly, similar to comments in truckload, we are seeing some examples like that of volatility and aggressive movement of margin that maybe didn't occur quite the same 10 years or 20 years ago. But all of that activity is typical in terms of the reduction or addition of supply as the marketplace wavers.","So, similar to the broad comments I made about the enterprise, the fact that there's volatility and margins are moving around is well within the boundaries of what we think we're going to need to do in our long-term plans. Since the additional investment in Phoenix four years ago and now followed on with APC, our team has had great momentum in terms of leveraging the increased scale that we've had to become that number one NVO from China to North America, and really looking at how you leverage scale in the Global Forwarding business to be more competitive and to provide better service. We've mentioned several times over the last year our additional initiatives in the airfreight world where, again, the margins are heavily driven by scale and density where you have to build up your volume and build full pallets in order to get to kind of industry norms around profitability. So our long-term outlook is that we hope to be able to continue to gain scale and improve our margins on airfreight by building that density.","On the ocean freight standpoint, we do feel like we've reached a level of competitiveness and scale where our margins are very good. But there are a lot of opportunities to expand corridors like Asia to Europe and North America to Europe where we don't have that same level of volume and activity today.","So overall the team is in a good spot, we like our network, we like the scale and competitiveness that we've reached in some of the primary ocean corridors, and we're investing aggressively in other areas and other services to try to build up with that. So, all in all a very positive outlook for our forwarding business going forward.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. To Andy with a question on the bad debt accrual. Can you talk about why the year-to-date bad debt accrual is tracking down nearly 80% year-over-year? Also, did you make any accrual for bad debt for Hanjin in the quarter? And how should we think about bad debt next year? Should it normalize to, say, just under 1% of net revenues?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah. I'll answer them in a slightly different order. First we don't have exposure to Hanjin simply because they're not a customer, so there's no accrual for Hanjin. And then back to the first part which is overall Robinson's receivables are down versus last year. The reason they show as being up on the balance sheet is that we closed the APC acquisition on September 30 and we have an opening balance sheet which is reflected of their numbers. But traditional C.H. Robinson receivables are down. So that's the first reason why the reserve is down.","The second reason is the quality of the receivables are up. So each of our customers receive a D&B rating, and today there are more dollars in what we call the low risk category of customers, there are more dollars in that low risk category today than there were last year. So therefore, that lowers your reserves.","The final category is the aging. And again it goes below 60 days and above 60 days in terms of our aging categories. There are more dollars today in the less than 60 days category than there were last year. Again, you take higher-quality receivables where the amount that is in less than 60 days is higher than last year, therefore you have a low receivable.","As far as looking forward into the future, it's certainly hard to determine or give an accurate prediction as to whether we will take more customers in the low to medium or high risk category, or whether those customers will be paying in 30 days, 45 days or beyond 60 days. So, we are very happy with our credit and finance team, our credit and finance policies, so we do expect to continue to drive good results on our receivables balance.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. To John, an M&A question. With the APC acquisition complete do you expect to focus on acquisition opportunities going forward more domestically or globally?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","We've hit on this a little bit already but we do expect to continue to look for both. We will look for market share and service expansion opportunities both in North America and outside of it. Andy talked about some of the restructuring that we've done to make sure that we can take the earnings that we're now achieving outside of North America and redeploy those internationally to have a more efficient structure. So with that in place and the success of some of our businesses outside of North America, the mix going forward will have a greater bent towards looking at global acquisitions than we had in the past, but we'll continue to look for both.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John, and staying on the topic of APC for Andy. Can you please provide us more color on the APC acquisition? What's the split between air and ocean? And what is the geographic distribution? Do you expect APC's net revenue growth to be similar, slower or faster than the legacy business?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yes. And it's great; we've hit on this theme several times throughout the morning, and the color is we're really excited to have them part of the Robinson Global Forwarding network.","Prior to the acquisition I think they were the sixth largest forwarder in Australia. The mix of their business, because it's an agent-based business, was primarily ocean and forward to customs with a little air import mixed in. I think if you were to categorize it, it's roughly a third of it was coming from North America, a third from Europe and a third from Asia.","And so, but because they were an agent -based network and they were focused primarily on the import, they didn't focus as much on the export market, which Australia does have a pretty strong export market. Now that they are part of a global network of company-owned stores that are branded Robinson, they can begin to really sell. And as John mentioned, the initial interactions have been incredibly positive, an Australia export service. And we've got teams in the U.S. We've got teams in Europe and teams in Asia that are working on it.","Additionally, and we talked a little bit about this, is that we're able to pick up that business that they were traditionally running through agents in Europe and Asia. Roughly that was by order of magnitude two-thirds of the business. So we're excited about the initial returns on picking up their agent businesses in those markets because we have teams on the ground that are working on it today.","I would just finally close by, usually, it's very rare to find an acquisition like this where the cultural fit is exceptionally high. They run their operations incredibly tight and incredibly successful, and they fit very well into the Robinson culture and the Robinson team. There are a lot of incremental and additional opportunities that we look to explore with them. So the color is very positive.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. To John with an LTL question. What are your expectations for LTL growth, especially if we remain in a relatively lackluster industrial production environment? Do you think you can meaningfully outpace the market growth by taking share from the asset-based providers?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So I guess the first point of clarification is when we think about our LTL offering, we don't see it as competing directly with the asset providers. It's about partnering with those asset providers and the vast majority of everything we do in the LTL space, it is tendering it to a traditional asset-based LTL network where they're executing the freight.","So from our standpoint, the question becomes how much more of the market can we prove our value proposition to be involved in the transaction, to use our technology, to use our routing, to use our tools to help both the shipper and the carrier with a better outcome around doing that? We do feel good about that. We think we can continue to take market share and grow faster than the overall market just by continuing to penetrate our services that are out there. So yeah, we do feel very positive about it. And in terms of the competitive market, there are some additional LTL third parties or brokers today that maybe they weren't 10 years or 15 years ago. But again, as I commented earlier, I think that in some ways provides validation to our business model and how we're adding value and we'll have to continue to evolve with a more competitive landscape just like we do in all of our other services.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy on ELDs. Are you beginning to hear from customers that want to secure capacity from carriers that are already ELD compliant? What procedures does Robinson have in place to make sure that carriers they use are compliant once the mandate is effective?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah, we really haven't heard any specific request from customers related specifically to using ELD-compliant carriers. So, it just hasn't come up yet. As far as the accountability in terms of the compliance, so let's all remember that ELD's aren't actually changing the hours of service; it's only changing the manner in which those carriers comply to the hours of service. And today as well in December of 2017 when the new law goes into effect, is part of our agreement with all of our carriers is that they comply with local, state and federal regulations and laws. And we would expect them to continue to comply with all local, state and federal laws just like we do today. So there won't be any change in terms of how we actually adjudicate that.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. To John for a question on European truck brokerage. What percentage of your truck brokerage net revenue is generated in Europe? How would you characterize the state of the truckload supply and demand dynamic in Europe? Are margins behaving better in Europe than in the U.S.?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So our European business represents about 5% of our truckload net revenue. Because we're much smaller in Europe and don't have the network scale, our margins are lower in Europe than they are in North America. In addition, because we have that smaller, more transactional network, our margins in Europe are actually more stable than they are in North America. Again, that's just in the Robinson business. We've talked a lot today about how those committed relationships and the large shippers that we deal with and enter into those agreements that are more \u2013 a little more than half of our North America truckload business contribute meaningfully to kind of the margin volatility and the expansion and compression that we have during the various cycles. So our business in Europe is profitable, the margins are lower, but they are more stable because of the mix of business and the transactional majority that we do in Europe.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. To Andy and a question on managed services. Your TMC operations seems to have emerged as the premier transportation manager in the U.S. Are you satisfied with the revenue and profit generated from this operation given the amount of freight you manage, and the amount of value you create for customers?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","I guess it's hard to say that we're not satisfied with 31% growth in the quarter. The team there is doing a great job, and yes we agree with your statement with one caveat. We do believe that TMC is the premier transportation manager, but not only in the U.S. but the entire world. We have five control towers on four continents and the Indian subcontinent, and it's backed up by a world-class IT team that provides global supply chain visibility. They continue to win mandates from new and existing customers, and are on track to manage over $4 billion in freight spend. So, yeah, we're pretty satisfied.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. To John with a quick question on regulation. Are there any other pending regulations you think could cause a disruption to trucking capacity? If so, can you please give your thoughts on them.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Short answer is no. Andy kind of lined out the discussion around ELDs and why we don't think that will be disruptive from our standpoint. In our industry presentations we talk a lot about the last six years or seven years and the escalation of regulation around safety and emissions type themes, hours of service, CSA and different things that have added cost and have added some price inflection to various periods in the truckload portion of it. We've lived through most of those. ELD is just kind of the big one that everyone's talking about right now and we don't expect a lot for that. So, short answer is no.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy on the topic of M&A. How does the acquisition pipeline look? Are you seeing quality properties that might be a good accretive strategic fit? Are valuation expectations on the part of the seller reasonable?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yes. We have a really strong team dedicated to this area and the acquisitions pipeline looks good right now. That doesn't mean that we're going to run out and buy a bunch of companies, because our filter is what they've always been. It's cultural, it's strategic, it's business model and its value. We're in constant dialogue with companies that are out there and remain disciplined in our approach. Some sellers right now are reasonable while others, their valuation expectations are beyond what we believe are reasonable. So...","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John on intermodal. Would you consider buying a large existing intermodal franchise from an asset-based carrier? Would you be willing to fix an existing business? Or would you prefer to buy something already firing on all cylinders? Or would you rather just grow organically? Have your thoughts evolved on this in recent months?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Well, from an overall M&A philosophy standpoint our first preference is to grow organically because that does have the highest return on it. We've acknowledged that there are a lot of opportunities where we can invest through M&A and not only accelerate our growth but sometimes bring in management and business processes that we're not as capable at that are really good for us. So we have not, and we do not really look at kind of fixer-upper type acquisitions. We're generally looking for what we think are well-run and good businesses that are going to add to the strength of our network and add to our competencies because we really don't have the bandwidth or the extra management in place to go around and fix things.","We would like to be bigger in the intermodal business. We do remain very open-minded about intermodal opportunities and looking at how we can be more relevant to that space in the future, but our approach has generally been around looking for good management teams and well-run businesses that will make us stronger.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. To Andy with the next question. How are you thinking about your preferred spot or contractual mix heading into 2017, given the general consensus expectation that ELDs will begin to have an impact on capacity next year which could drive higher rates and margin compression, especially if you have an outsized mix of business tied to contractual commitments.","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","We've hit this point quite a few times, not only on this call but also in previous ones where we try to meet customers where they want to buy. And what we've seen and what we've experienced for some time now is customers are looking to secure capacity and they're looking to secure rates which is part of the reason why we're helping them manage their supply chains and growing our volumes the way they have. So with that being said, our mix between contractual and spot remains fairly consistent quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. When we see disruption, whether it's significant or not, on either supply or demand, that mix shift shifts.","So, if we were to see a significant impact in capacity to yield these, which by the way, we don't anticipate, we would expect to see more higher-margin opportunities in the spot market while we would continue to honor our commitments to our contractual customers for the term of the agreement, which \u2013 they usually reset every 160-plus days. So, obviously volume would increase if there's a disruption, and we would take advantage of it in the spot market and we would continue to honor those contracts on the contractual side but we would also take advantage of \u2013 in a situation like that where routing guides failed, the further down you go the more opportunities there are for margin expansion.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Unfortunately, we're out of time and we apologize that we couldn't get to all the questions that came in. We really appreciate everybody participating in the third quarter of 2016 conference call. This call will be available for replay in the Investor Relations section of the C.H. Robinson website at chrobinson.com. It can be accessed by dialing 1-877-660-6853 and entering the passcode 13646518#. And that replay should be available later this morning.

This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."],"4459":["C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) Q1 2018 Earnings Call May  2, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson First Quarter 2018 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, Bob Houghton will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, May 2, 2018.","I will now turn the call over to Bob Houghton, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Andy Clark, Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Biesterfeld, Chief Operating Officer and President of North America Surface Transportation. John, Andy, and Bob will provide commentary on our 2018 first quarter results. Presentation slides that accompany their remarks can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com. We will follow that with responses to the pre-submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday. I'd like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements.","Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.","And with that, I will turn the call over to John.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. We recently announced the formation of the role of Chief Operating Officer and Bob Biesterfeld's promotion. Bob will be working with the other divisional presidents and chaired services leaders to optimize the performance of all of our operating divisions. He will also lead our information technology and commercial go-to-market strategies to accelerate the digital transformation of our businesses around the globe. Bob will share some of his initial thoughts on these strategies later in today's presentation. In his new role as Chief Operating Officer, Bob will be a regular participant on these earnings calls.","In my opening remarks, I want to highlight some of the headlining themes that you'll be hearing us talk about. First, we are in a unprecedented freight environment. The healthy economy and rapid growth in e-commerce is driving a significant increase in the demand for freight. At the same time, driver shortages and enforcement of the electronic logging device mandate is motivating carriers to be increasingly selective in the loads they are willing to carry, resulting in a tightened capacity environment. The result is a very fluid and dynamic market. To illustrate this point, costs in our North America truckload business increased 21.5% this quarter, the largest single quarterly increase in our 21-year history as publicly traded company.","Pricing has continued to escalate from previous quarters. We delivered double-digit price increases across most of our service lines this quarter, including a 21% increase in North America truckload. Rapidly rising prices typically create incremental spot market activity and margin compression on committed pricing arrangements. We experienced both of these in our first quarter results.","The strength of our business model over time is our ability to balance our portfolio of long-standing contractual relationships we have with our customers and our ability to participate in spot market freight opportunities, all while delivering supply chain expertise to both shippers and carriers around the globe. In a rapidly rising freight cost environment, shipper route guide performance deteriorates, which drives a shift in freight volume into the spot market. Our truckload transactional volume increased at double-digit rates during the quarter, but it was not enough to overcome the declines in our contractual volume.","We continue to believe that the right business model is leveraging our people, process and technology to build long-term committed relationships with shippers and carriers around the world, while also fulfilling spot market opportunities when they become available. In a rapidly rising cost environment, the concept of award management honoring customer commitments is critically important. This is a core component of our account management practices that we believe are part of the foundation for long-term value creation.","More to come on each of these topics, but with those introductory comments, I'll turn it over to Andy now to review our financial statements.","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by recognizing the hard work of the entire team in this volatile freight environment. We saw aggregate volume growth across all transportation services, a double-digit increase in net revenue, and increased operating profits. We did this while continuing to make significant investments for future growth. We also delivered operating margin expansion in both NAST and Managed Services. Profits did fall short of expectations, however, in our Global Forwarding and Robinson Fresh segments. Both teams are working hard to return to best-in-class results.","Now, on to slide 4 and our financial results. First quarter total revenues increased 14.9% to $3.9 billion, driven by significantly higher pricing across all service lines, volume growth in LTL and Global Forwarding, and higher fuel costs. Total company net revenues increased by $57 million, or 10.1% in the quarter. Net revenue growth was led by truckload services, up $26 million and LTL services up $15 million. We saw the benefit of recent investments in our Global Forwarding air service line where net revenue increased 32%, or $7 million in the quarter. First quarter ocean net revenues increased $6 million.","Total operating expenses were up $54 million, or 14.1%, driven by higher personnel and SG&A expenses. First quarter personnel expenses increased 13%. Total company average head count increased 5.7% in the quarter, led by increases to support volume growth, opportunities in our Global Forwarding and Managed Services businesses. Variable compensation also increased in the quarter. We expect variable compensation to be elevated for the full year, given our soft performance in 2017.","SG&A expenses were up 17.7% in the quarter to $106 million. As a reminder, our last year first quarter results included a one-time favorable $8.75 million legal settlement. Excluding the impact of this settlement, our first quarter SG&A expenses increased 7.3%, primarily driven by the write-off of a supplier advance in Robinson Fresh and increased occupancy and depreciation and amortization expense. SG&A expenses declined 3% on a sequential basis.","Total operating income was $192 million in the first quarter, up 1.9 % over last year. Operating income as a percentage of net revenue was 30.6%, 250 basis points below last year's first quarter. Our objective is to grow operating income at a rate equal to or greater than net revenue, so we still have work to do in this area. We will continue to invest while managing expenses and striving for greater efficiencies as we move through 2018. Bob will provide more context on what we were doing to drive operating margin improvement in his remarks.","First quarter net income was $142 million, an increase of 16.6%, and diluted earnings per share was $1.01, up from $0.86 in the same period last year.","On to slide 5 and other items impacting net income. The first quarter effective tax rate was 21.3%, down from 31.7% last year. The lower tax rate was driven primarily by the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate. Also, it is typical for our tax rate to be lower in the first quarter than the full year, primarily due to the tax impact of restricted stock delivery. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 24% and 25% for the full year.","In the first quarter, we adopted the new accounting standards update for revenue recognition. Starting with the first quarter of 2018, in-transit shipments will now be included in our financial results. We do not expect this policy to have a material impact on our enterprise operating results; however, within our Robinson Fresh division, our total revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $27 million. There was no impact to net revenue.","Interest and other expense was $10.7 million, an increase of 15% in the quarter, driven primarily by increased debt levels and higher variable interest rates on our short-term debt. Changes in foreign currency did not have a material impact on our first quarter results. Our share count in the quarter was approximately flat as share repurchases were offset by the impact of activity in our equity compensation plans.","Slide 6 outlines our operating cash flow and capital distribution for the quarter. Through a combination of improved working capital performance and increased earnings, we generated just over $200 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, a 116% increase over the prior year period. We returned $135 million to shareholders in the quarter, a 23% increase versus the last year period. In line with our stated policy, we continue to evaluate and deploy our capital in ways that both drive better performance and increase shareholder value. We will make the investments in people, processes, and technology that generate outstanding results for our customers and returns for our shareholders. We will look to acquire companies that fit our strategies, business model and culture. And we will reward our shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Capital expenditures totaled $15.5 million in the quarter. We continue to expect full year CapEx of $60 million to $70 million, with the majority dedicated to technology.","Now, onto the balance sheet on slide 7. Working capital improved 1.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by a reduction in accounts receivable, given the seasonal sequential decline in total revenue versus the fourth quarter of 2017. First quarter working capital, as a percent of total revenue, remained relatively flat versus the fourth quarter. The contract asset and accrued transportation expense lines on the balance sheet reflect in-transit activity in accordance with the newly-adopted revenue recognition policy. Our debt balance at quarter end was $1.4 billion. Across our credit facility, private placement debt and AR securitization, our weighted average interest rate was 3.3% in the quarter.","On April 9, we issued the first public debt offering in our company history. The details are listed on slide 8. The offering consisted of $600 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at a fixed rate of 4.2%. We received an investment grade rating from both S&P and Moody's, and are pleased with the successful outcome of the issuance. We used the majority of the proceeds to repay the outstanding balance on our credit facility. With interest rates expected to rise in the future, we believe locking in current rates for a 10-year period is a prudent decision from a capital structure perspective. This bond offering also provides us with greater flexibility in our capital structure to both fund future acquisitions and working capital needs.","I will wrap up my comments this morning with a look at our current trends. Our consistent practice is to share the per business day comparison, and this April has one additional business day versus the prior year. April 2018 global net revenue per business day has increased 11%, while truckload volume has decreased approximately 6% versus the year ago period where volumes increased 10%. We are working closely with our customers to achieve pricing reflective of the marketplace conditions, while continuing to meet our volume commitments. We continued to see committed volume declines in April in North America truckload as we actively re-price business where appropriate.","Our account managers are focused on award management, ensuring we honor our customer commitments, while also securing additional transactional freight opportunities. Our April performance includes strong double-digit growth in transactional freight. New carrier sign-ups in April were relatively consistent with the pace in the first quarter, so we are not currently seeing a negative impact from the April 1 hard enforcement of the ELD mandate.","Thank you all for listening this morning, and I will now turn it over to Bob to provide additional context on our segment performance.","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you all today. I want to open by saying that I'm really looking forward to serving the over 15,000 employees of C.H. Robinson across our global network in this new role. As John mentioned in his introduction, my focus will be on continuing to drive the digital transformation of our business. Each of our business units are at a different stage in this journey, and we have an exciting roadmap ahead of us that will improve our customer and carrier experiences, accelerate the pace of innovation and technology deployment across our platform, and drive greater synergies between our operating divisions, leading to a more streamlined organization.","One of the key ways we measure the dynamic nature of the logistics market is captured on slide 10. The light and dark blue lines on the graph represent the percent change in North America truckload rate and cost per mile to customers and carriers, net of fuel cost since 2008. The gray line is the net revenue margin for all transportation services.","As John mentioned in his opening remarks, the change in the North America truckload rate per mile and cost per mile both exceeded 20% this quarter. Given the current dynamic of tight capacity and strong demand, we do expect freight market volatility and higher pricing to continue for the balance of the year. You can also see that despite the high level of volatility in a freight market, we are able to maintain our margins through these extended freight cycles. Our first quarter transportation net revenue margin of 16.4% is up slightly versus the same period five years ago and our annual net revenue has increased over $650 million during this five-year time period.","One of the metrics we use to measure market capacity and volatility is the routing guide depth from our Managed Services business. In the first quarter, average routing guide depth was 2.0, representing that on average, the second carrier in a shipper's routing guide was executing the shipment. The quarter also included weeks where the routing guide spikes to 5 in certain parts of the country, indicating periods of localized significant type (16:25) markets. By comparison, last year's routing guide depth averaged 1.4, which is typically what you would see in a balanced market. We think this chart does a great job illustrating the significance of both cyclicality and volatility in the North American trucking market.","The broad-based increases in market pricing over the past three quarters have presented many challenges for the industry and our customers. I'd like to recognize all of our customer-facing employees that are working to bring innovative solutions that help customers navigate this marketplace. I'd also like to recognize the work of our over 1,300 carrier account managers that are consistently providing a great experience for our carriers. The fact that these carriers choose to work with C.H. Robinson makes it possible for to us serve our customers in this fast changing environment.","Turning to slide 11 and our North American Surface Transportation business; NAST net revenue increased 11.4% to $415 million in the quarter, led by growth in our truckload and less than truckload service lines. In the truckload market, the continued combination of strong demand and tight capacity led to a sharp increase in freight cost in the quarter. In our contractual business, we worked with customers to adjust pricing to reflect the rising cost environment. Our teams were also active in helping customers secure capacity within the spot market as customer routing guides failed. Led by higher pricing, our net revenue increased 10.1% to $295 million in the quarter. Re-pricing activity did negatively impact our volumes in the quarter, as double-digit growth in transactional shipments was offset by declines in contractual shipments. Overall truckload volume declined 7% versus the year ago period where volume increased 11%. The combination of contractual volume declines and transactional volume growth resulted in approximate mix of 55% contractual and 45% transactional volume for the quarter. Despite double-digit net revenue growth, we are not satisfied with volume declines in a market where industry truckload volumes are growing.","Over the past several years, we've spoken about the concept of balanced growth within our NAST truckload business, and a continued long-term focus on taking market share and growing volumes above industry benchmarks. This continues to be our long-term focus. We realize, though, that over some periods, our volume will either lag or lead that of the overall marketplace as we adjust our portfolio mix in line with market conditions. As a result, we do expect our volume performance to improve in the second quarter and throughout the balance of 2018. Volume comparisons also ease as we move through the year. At the same time, we will continue to remain disciplined on pricing and adjusting to market changes.","To help improve volume growth, we continue to add carriers to our network. We added roughly 4,200 new carriers in the first quarter, a 17% increase over last year's first quarter, and a 14% sequential improvement versus fourth quarter. These new carriers moved approximately 22,000 shipments for us in the quarter. As Andy said, the ELD mandate that took effect on December 18 is not slowing our rate of new carrier adoption. In fact, our new carrier adoption rate is increasing. Despite the hard enforcement of the ELD mandate on April 1, we're continuing to sign up new carriers at a rate similar to the first quarter. Carriers continue to see C.H. Robinson as the 3PL of choice. The continued addition of thousands of motor carriers every quarter allows us to continue to expand the largest fleet of motor carriers in North America and bring new capacity solutions to life for our customers.","Our less than truckload business delivered another quarter of strong performance. Net revenue increased 14.8% to $107 million, an 8% increase in LTL volume was driven by higher freight in our manufacturing vertical and a 50% increase in e-commerce shipments. Within our intermodal service line, net revenues decreased 13.8% for the quarter, driven by higher accessorial and dray costs. We have just launched a new technology within intermodal which will allow us to more efficiently move freight within our customers' networks from the road to the rail. This launch, coupled with improving rail services, should drive volume and net revenue growth within intermodal over the balance of the year.","Slide 12 outlines our NAST operating profit performance. First quarter operating profit increased 11.7% to $174 million. Operating margin improved 10 basis points to 42%, strong performance versus the year-ago period that included the $8.75 million favorable legal settlement. We're making good progress against the efficiency and productivity initiatives we outlined at our Investor Day last May. We continue to invest in technology to drive productivity by launching tools that automate both our customer and carrier interactions, as well as our internal workflows. We're also selectively consolidating activities and office locations across our network to maximize our scale. As a result of this, we were able to deliver total NAST volume growth that exceeded our rate of head count growth for the ninth consecutive quarter. The rate of head count growth in NAST declined for the fourth consecutive quarter and we expect NAST head count to remain flat for the full year.","Turning to slide 13 in our Global Forwarding business. Global Forwarding net revenues increased 15.5% to $123 million for the quarter with growth in each of our service lines. Our recent acquisition of Milgram & Company in Canada contributed approximately 5 percentage points to the growth in the quarter. Ocean net revenues increased 8.3% for the quarter with Milgram contributing approximately 3 percentage points to the growth. Ocean shipments increased 11% in the quarter, led by increases in Europe, Oceania, and North America. We have an extremely strong sales pipeline of new and existing customers in our ocean business.","First quarter air net revenues increased 27.7%, with Milgram contributing approximately 2 percentage points. Air shipments increased approximately 18% in the quarter, as we continue to have benefits from investments to grow volume and density in our air gateway cities. Air freight costs have increased over the past few quarters, as increased demand continues to outpace supply. So we're actively adjusting pricing to reflect current market conditions.","Customs net revenues increased 28.5% in the quarter, with Milgram contributing 21% of that growth. Customs transactions increased approximately 61% in the first quarter as we execute our strategy of broadening our service portfolio and expanding our customs presence across the globe.","Our Global Forwarding business continues to benefit from an expanded service offering and geographic footprint. The first quarter of 2018 represents the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit net revenue growth. I'd like to offer congratulations to the Global Forwarding team on another quarter of strong top-line performance.","Slide 14 outlines our Global Forwarding operating profit performance. First quarter operating profit declined 49.3% to $8 million. Operating margin declined 850 basis points to 6.7%. Operating expenses increased 27% in the quarter. Headcount increased 21% with Milgram accounting for approximately 8 percentage points of the head count growth. Increased people and leased warehouse space in air freight and technology investments across all service lines were the primary drivers of the operating expense increase. To be clear, this level of profit performance fell well below our expectations for the quarter.","We continue to see significant opportunities to drive scale and geographic reach in our Global Forwarding business. Driving this growth will require continued investments in people, process, and technology. We're excited both about the organic and the acquired growth that's occurred in our Global Forwarding business over the past several years. We also realize we have opportunities to drive greater efficiency in how we operate. The digital transformation of this business is at an earlier stage than some of our other business units. We'll continue to be focused on the significant top-line growth opportunities in front of us, but will also be focused on operating margin expansion through additional technology deployments and intelligent process automation. Over the longer term, we expect our operating margin performance to be consistent with other leading companies in the Global Forwarding segment of the market and we expect our operating margin to improve over the balance of this year.","Transitioning to slide 15 and our Robinson Fresh segment. Sourcing net revenues were $30 million, down 1.7% from last year, due to a strategic customer exiting the fresh produce business. Net revenue in our international sourcing business increased at a double-digit pace, and transportation net revenues of $24 million were 9.3% below year ago levels. Truckload volume declines and margin compression in our committed truckload business was partially offset by an increase in revenue per load in transactional truckload business, and double-digit growth in LTL.","Slide 16 outlines our Robinson Fresh operating profit performance. First quarter operating profit declined 36.5% to $9 million. Operating margin declined 850 basis points, to 17.3%. Operating expenses increased 6% in the quarter, as a 6% reduction in head count was offset by increased personnel expenses on a per head basis, as well as a write off of a supplier advance. We have implemented plans to improve the profit profile of this Robinson Fresh business. Much of the transportation business re-pricing was completed in the first quarter, and will be implemented in the second quarter. We've also exited certain facilities within the network, invested in technology to improve our sourcing, office efficiency, and implemented stringent operating expense controls.","Moving to our all other and corporate businesses on slide 17. As a reminder, all other includes Managed Services, our Surface Transportation outside of North America, other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses. Managed Services net revenue increased 6.5% to $18.3 million in the quarter. Customers are increasingly valuing the Software-as-a-Service based transportation management system, allowing them to control their carrier selection process and manage their complex supply chains without the required investment in technology. Freight under management increased 19% in the quarter to nearly $1 billion. Given the highly automated nature of this business, we were able to invest for both customer and geographic growth and still expand operating profit margins 40 basis points.","Other Surface Transportation net revenues increased 2.5% in the quarter to $15.9 million. The increase was primarily the result of volume growth in Europe in both truckload and LTL service lines. We have a strong pipeline of new business and we expect these volume trends to increase in the second quarter.","So, before I turn the call back to John for some final comments, I'll take a minute to wrap up this section about our business unit performance. As you've seen, our business results were mixed, but overall positive for the quarter. Through a challenging environment, we assisted our customers in navigating the marketplace in the first quarter, and we helped them to accelerate commerce in their businesses.","Looking forward, I'm energized by the opportunities that sit in front of us. We have strong and experienced leaders, with industry expertise across the globe leading each of our services. We've got a team of over 15,000 people across our enterprise that are aggressive, customer-centric, and focused on creating and delivering value. We've got a global digital ecosystem that includes over 120,000 customers and 73,000 active carriers. We've got a technology or organization that's nearly 800 people strong, and is dedicated to continuing to lead our industry in driving innovation, productivity improvement, and customer value.","Our foundation has been built around people, process and technology, and this is going to carry forward as we continue to evolve. Look for us to continue to leverage emerging technology and advanced analytics more aggressively, as we move forward in order to further transform how we operate our business and how we serve both our customers and our carriers. I truly believe that our best days are ahead of us.","Thanks for listening this morning, and I'll turn it back to John at this point to make some closing comments before we address your pre-submitted questions.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Bob. Before moving to the questions, I'll wrap up our prepared remarks with some comments on our expectations for the balance of 2018. We do believe that the current freight market fundamentals will continue for the next several quarters. We expect demand for freight to remain high, with aging driver demographics and declining numbers of new truck drivers, we expect the driver shortage to continue. With the hard enforcement of ELDs taking effect on April 1, we expect industry capacity to remain tight. So given the healthy economy, high freight demand and tight capacity environment, we expect prices to remain elevated for the balance of 2018. We are focused on working closely with our customers to help them understand the market, to ensure we both meet our customer commitments and achieve pricing reflective of the market conditions. We will continue to leverage our digital transformation to provide our people with an expanding set of insights and capabilities to increase the value of the supply chain expertise we deliver to our customers and carriers, and we will remain focused on operating cost efficiency, driving higher levels of service execution, and increasing returns to our shareholders.","Lastly, I would also like to personally thank the over 15,000 Robinson employees around the world for their hard work and effort this quarter. In a rapidly-changing freight environment, we were able to deliver double-digit net revenue growth, expand our digital capabilities, make significant investments in our Global Forwarding business, and deliver increased operating income. We also returned $135 million to shareholders this quarter and delivered a significant improvement in our operating cash flow. I'm confident that we have the right people, processes, and technology to continue to win in the marketplace.","That concludes our prepared comments. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator to answer the pre-submitted questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Mr. Houghton, the floor is yours for the Q&A session.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Donna. First, I would like to thank the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions after our earnings release yesterday. For today's Q&A session, I will frame-up the question and then turn it over to John, Andy, or Bob for a response. And the first question is on operating margin and comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Chris Weatherbee with Citi, and Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan also asked about operating margin.","John, we are in the most robust freight market in nearly 15 years, and C.H. Robinson was only able to drive a 2% increase in operating income on a year-over-year basis. What is the company going to do to improve profitability and how should we be thinking about net operating trends bigger picture?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","The bigger picture approach around profitability when we do our long range planning and when we analyze our business has always been to kind of separate looking at net revenue growth and then the operating margins. It's the way we format this deck for the call and it's the way we do our long-range planning internally. Our goal has been, and remains that we believe we can grow our net revenue and our operating income at similar rates. That brings in all of the stuff that we've already discussed around volume and price at the gross margin level, and then it gets into the operating efficiencies and the scale lever points that we have at the operating income line item.","If you look at Q1, we did last year discuss the legal settlement. If you adjust for that, we let you do your own pro forma calculations, but we, in a 10% net revenue quarter, grew our operating income adjusted for that legal settlement in the 6% to 7% range. But as we acknowledged in our prepared comments, on an overall basis, not where we want to be long-term, and what we're doing to improve that as 2018 progresses. Over the last five years, as we've invested significantly in our Global Forwarding network, one of the things we did a couple of years ago was move to segment reporting because we believe that understanding the various services that we offer and the different margin and growth dynamics are relevant.","Within the NAST division, the high-level story around profitability is that we committed 20 years ago when we went public, that we were going to be more than a transactional truck broker and that we were also going to serve our customers the way they wanted to be as a Tier I common carrier to go after a lot of those committed freight relationships. While the truckload environment is growing significantly and prices are changing, we've been very transparent in our growth strategy around being a committed provider that also sources capacity on a transactional basis in the marketplace.","If you look at our largest source of revenue being a mid-teens margin business that we source daily in the spot market, and those costs went up 21%, we had to re-earn and recommit to well over half of our portfolio in a very active marketplace. So, from the standpoint of we shedded some committed volume and the market was very active, but if you were within Robinson in the first quarter of 2018, you know that a lot of activity occurred and there was a lot of effort put forth to adapt to where the market is at. Despite that, in the NAST segment, we did grow operating income and net revenue at a comparable rate and adjusted for the legal settlement which is pushed into that segment, did show some of the operating leverage and some of the benefits of what a transactional market can give us during this period of time.","We talked through, in the prepared comments, the challenges in the GF segment that we continue to grow, but we leaned in heavily on some network investments at the operating expense line item and we will continue to rationalize those quickly to make sure that the ones that are paying off are capitalized on and the rest of them are shut down or balanced accordingly.","In Fresh, I think you see some of the segments and verticals where re-pricing is even more challenging, and the sort of net revenue compression that can happen where you're less successful doing that, and we also had some expense challenges that Bob talked about and we're addressing there. So overall, we're not happy with the operating income performance for the quarter, but we're on top of it. We believe that we have the right model and the right disciplines in place to grow our operating income more in line with our net revenue for the remainder of this year. And long-term that continues to be our growth strategy for value creation and growing the business together.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. The next question is on volume and comes from Dave Vernon with Bernstein. Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan also asked about volume. Bob, can you discuss the drivers of volume decline in the truckload segment? Is this loads you can't find capacity for and are turning away, or is this freight that is being booked away by shippers?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So we talked about it in some of the prepared comments and the fact that our volume decline within North America transportation for Q1 was largely driven by declines in the contractual marketplace, while our spot market or transactional business actually grew double digits. We do see this happen typically in periods of rising rates, where that portfolio tends to shift a little bit. As we've talked about before, Robinson does tend to have a higher percentage of our total portfolio tied to those committed customer contracts.","So we worked hard in first quarter to manage those commitments for our customers, ensuring that we met the awards that were given to us in the best of our ability. As we look forward and think about truckload volume, we do anticipate that volume to come back, both in the transactional and the spot market throughout the period of the balance of this year.","Typically, when we're in environments like this, you might see shippers award heavy to contractual, but then see that some of those rates don't pay out, and we have routing guide degradation or routing guide failure. And in most cases, we may see opportunities come back to us in subsequent weeks, months, or quarters.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. The next question is from Matt Young with Morningstar. John, could you please provide some color on the tradeoff between volume and core pricing within the NAST truckload business?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So Bob addressed what's happening in the current marketplace. I want to try to build a little bit on the volume\/pricing tradeoffs in terms of our go-to-market strategies and how we think about this longer term. There is no question that over the longer period that the gains in market share and increases in volumes are what drive a lot of the value creation in Robinson. So many of our core business practices are about go-to-market sales activities, targeting different regions or segments, and making certain that we're very aggressively going after volume in the aggregate to expand our network and continue to grow our market share.","On a year-to-year basis, in terms of how we're thinking about pricing and volume tradeoffs, because of the fact that we source all of our capacity in the marketplace, we don't really get to decide exactly what that tradeoff of volume and margin is going to be. It's a very iterative process with our customers during the bids. While we believe we're the largest truckload provider in North America, it's most common to have several hundred participants and bidders in a large contract bid. And those bid processes are really settling through what that shipper's particular view may be around price increases and how they're approaching the market, and comparing and contrasting what we and the other providers sort out. So even though we're a large provider, it's a very fragmented market, and we do not have the kind of market share to sort of command exactly where we want to end up in that volume and pricing tradeoff in each particular committed relationship.","I think what you're seeing in the current market is that we believe that the material or significant price increases are going to stay with us for the remainder of the year. Some of the repricing that occurred last year has proven to be inadequate, and some of the pricing that we're applying in the marketplace today is not being accepted by those shippers who are trying to take a different approach in terms of how they route their freight. So we do accept the fact that there are volume and price tradeoffs, and it just becomes a byproduct of how we enter into each bid arrangement and the results of each of those shipper interactions.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. The next question is from Fadi Chamoun with BMO. Bob, can you grow volumes in NAST without adding head count? Maybe thoughts on the operating leverage opportunity you see in the segment as you continue to benefit from favorable market conditions.","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. We've shown in the last few quarters that we can grow volume at a rate ahead of head count growth, and that is our plan moving forward. Our head count mix is a little bit more complex than it appears at the summarized level that we report at due to the fact that we're organized within the business into specific functions. So as we introduce more process automation, more digital trading with our customers and carriers, we're able to grow both volume and revenue, without adding head count within certain functions. This still allows us to invest in head count that drives top line revenue growth in roles such as sales and account management.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. The next question is from Ben Hartford with R.W. Baird. Andy, any reason to believe the 2018 Q1 bad debt expense provision for doubtful accounts will remain elevated for the balance of the year, or was it simply a first quarter issue given the supplier advance write off?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. One of the highlights of the first quarter was actually the really strong cash flow performance where we generated just over $200 million in cash flow from operations. If you compare that to Q1 of last year, that was $92 million, and if you compare that to the fourth quarter of 2017, it was $165 million. So really strong cash flow performance driven by strong earnings performance as well as strong working capital performance. The allowance for doubtful accounts was down 5% from the end of the year. So the team out there and broadly speaking the business, finance have done a wonderful job of driving the order to cash cycle. And the improvements that we made in the first quarter of this year, we would expect to see continue throughout 2018.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. The next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bob, are you still seeing customers eager to lock in committed truckload rates with Robinson despite today's elevated market? Or are your customers becoming more willing to take on spot rate risk looking into the second and third quarters?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So I think it helps with this question to think about kind of the macro environment around truckload in terms of what freight typically moves in the contract versus spot. And if we think about the normal marketplace, typically 80% to 85% of freight is going to move in that contractual marketplace and 15% to 20% moving in transactional. So if we think back to last year at this time when spot rates really lagged contractual rates, we actually saw shippers withholding some portion of their total freight from their bid activities so that they could capitalize on that spot environment.","Today in this rising cost environment, where the spot rates are more of a leading indicator to higher contractual rates, shippers are really working to maximize the amount of freight that they're allocating into that contractual marketplace. The reality, though, is many of these awarded rates don't necessarily hold up in rising markets. And what was originally planned as contract or committed ends up being tendered in a secondary market of some sort. That could come either at higher and non-awarded rates or in the true open spot market. So I don't know that shippers necessarily plan in this environment to have more freight enter the spot market. The freight that goes into the spot is typically more of an outcome of a plan that maybe didn't execute at the level that was planned for.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks. The next question is also for Bob, and comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc. How is bid season progressing and how much of your contract book has repriced 2018 to-date?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So John made some comments in an earlier question about the bid activity and the number of participants in the bids that we participate in. We stated in fourth quarter that we repriced a portion of our contractual business. As I think everyone knows, repricing activity is typically highest in the first quarter, but given the market dynamics over the past few months, repricing has been much more fluid than in more normal cycles. And bids and repricing has tended to happen a little bit more on the fly as these original plans fail to derive expected results.","So even though typical cycles are annual and bidding, our research shows us that the average age that a load actually moves at is closer to six to eight months versus annual, due to both customer and carrier networks changing. So this question of how much of our book has been repriced is a difficult one to answer. When we get the opportunity to reprice existing business in these bids, we also get the opportunity to price business that we previously haven't had the opportunity to participate in as a contractual provider. So when we see these bids, we typically see a rebalancing where we win some lanes that we previously didn't have and we lose some lanes that previously we may have had in the past period as a contractual provider.","Overall, we see the opportunity to bid on tens of billions of dollars of available freight on an annual basis that in this market shippers would prefer to assign as contractual. As John said earlier, we work leveraging our analytics and our processes and our pricing data to look at where we believe the market is going to go and represent the overall macro pricing environment in the marketplace. And shippers then make that decision on where to route us as either a contractual or committed provider, or leverage us in more of a backup or spot market environment.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. The next question is on the competitive environment, and comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch also asked about the competitive environment. Andy, have you seen more or less of tech entrants competitors in the marketplace given current market conditions?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah, the short answer is not really. So in terms of pure tech entrants, 2018 isn't any different than really the news that's been out there for the last several years. But I guess we'd like to take this opportunity to maybe broaden that out a little more in terms of, we face thousands of competitors every day in all parts of our business. And our go-to-market has been based on our people, our process, and our technology, and we have a great technology team. We invest a lot of money in our technology. And so we really want to make sure that when we talk about that, both internally as well as with our customers as well as our investors, we just think it's a combination of all three of those that differentiates us in the marketplace.","If you just then begin to think about if you came into the marketplace and purely as a tech play, when the market dislocated as much as it did at the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter and now continuing into 2018, we just don't think that that's a competitive advantage or a competitive edge when you're going and talking to our customers. And we do \u2013 John, Bob, I, our business leaders, our account managers, are out there every day, talking to our customers and they're looking for technology. They all want that technology and we believe that we're bringing it to them. But it's more than just technology. As Bob and John mentioned in their remarks as well as in their answers, you've got to be able to cover the freight, you've got to be able to help them manage very complex global supply chains, and you do that with technology, but you also do it with your people and your processes.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. The next question is for Bob. A number of analysts asked about operating margin in Global Forwarding. Can you describe the investments you are making in this business, and at what point would you expect to see margin improvement?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. So since our acquisition of Phoenix International in 2012, we've stated that our operating margin expectations are to be in the range of the industry leaders and close to or exceeding 30%, excluding acquisition amortization. So we still believe this is our target in a realistic case over time. If we look back at the past several quarters, we've invested in head count and facilities to drive revenue growth, specifically in the area of air freight. We feel really good about our growth in air freight over the last couple of quarters, as well as the top line growth in our other Global Forwarding services. But we realize we've got some work to do to catch up on our forward investment and expenses.","So related to the Milgram acquisition, we also added some heads in Asia ahead of transitioning agent (47:44) business from that acquisition. Those will also generate revenue moving forward. As we've made acquisitions in Global Forwarding over the past few years, we realize that we do still have some synergies to capture through these acquisitions, and we're focused on recognizing those. Late in the first quarter, we made some changes to some global processes around managing our transactions that we anticipate will have a measurable difference to our employee productivity compared to trailing quarters. So we're certainly not pleased with our operating margins this quarter, but we do expect our operating margins to return to a more normal level and to improve as 2018 progresses.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. The next question is for John. Several analysts have asked, what is fundamentally different about the Global Forwarding business that makes it a lower margin business than NAST?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So for those of you who have followed the Robinson story over the 21 years of us being publicly traded, you know that we started shortly before going public around our Global Forwarding diversification, and are 21 years, 20-some years into it. And I've confessed for the majority of that time that we weren't profitable or weren't successful until that tipping point of our acquisition of Phoenix 5.5 years, 6 years ago where we reached a certain level of scale. Throughout the last couple of decades, we've had the opportunity to do due diligence on a couple dozen different investment opportunities and have completed a couple of transactions, including the Phoenix investment.","Over that time, I guess we've become reasonably confident in our assessment of kind of the industry benchmarks and what our goals are and how they compare and contrast to our NAST or our other emerging businesses. At the gross margin level, Global Forwarding is a higher-margin business than our North American truckload. Both the air and ocean margins, from a percentage standpoint, are actually higher than our North America Surface Transportation. They're unique in that they require scale more so than the truckload. There really isn't that same opportunity to transactionally go after a single ocean box or some air freight. It's much more complex in terms of how you build corridors and how you contract with a more limited number of providers to make sure that you have the right scale and density in certain corridors.","As you can tell by this quarter's results, we continue to learn and invest in certain corridors and air freight and building out the maturity of our Global Forwarding network. But at the gross margin level, it actually can be higher than our North American Surface Trans, and that's what our experience has been the last five or six years. When you look at operating margins, we have articulated, and Bob restated that 30% growth goal, because we've acquired some businesses we exclude amortization, but from an operating standpoint, the operating income target of 30% of net revenue is lower than our mature NAST business, which has been in the low 40s. We also have some emerging businesses and Managed Services in Europe where we're in the double-digit, low double-digits or high single-digits where those are more maturing businesses.","In Global Forwarding, because you have businesses in a number of countries, you have local statutory and compliance requirements, you have overhead associated with at least two countries in every transaction, you have a lot more compliance costs around border clearances and different things, it is just a more cost-intensive and a more mature competitive global business that brings different cost structures with it. So, when we benchmark and look around, we feel fairly confident that that's an aggressive healthy target for us. And when you combine all of that, we feel like the returns on capital and the growth opportunities for value creation in Global Forwarding are comparable to those in our North America Surface Transportation and the other business units that we're transacting in.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Andy, a few analysts have asked about the Milgram acquisition. Bobby Termone (51:24) with BMO and Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Talk about the integration of Milgram. How is it progressing and has it played out in terms of its contribution as you had expected? Also, how long and how much investment does it take to convert the Milgram agent business?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah, I'm going to dovetail both John and Bob's comments. And when we started with the Phoenix acquisition, continued with the APC, and now Milgram, these are all important steps in our strategy in our global expansion, and our go-to-market with our customers. So, we've been really exceedingly pleased with all of them. To dive right into Milgram, at the end of the first quarter, we had converted about 80% of that agent business. So we expect by the end of the second quarter to have converted 100% of it.","Bob mentioned some of the investments that we're making in Asia and we've got a great team in Canada that are really helping us grow our presence there. And just having completed that acquisition at the start of the fourth quarter of last year, we feel really good about the progress the entire global team is making. If we go back, we ended last year with over $2 billion of gross revenue, and I think the Global Forwarding team is really starting to hit its stride, both in terms of its ability to serve its customers across the globe. And we think Milgram is an important part of that.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Todd Fowler with KeyBanc and Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan asked about our digital transformation. Bob, please elaborate on the comments around accelerating the digital transformation. Is this in response to increased competition in the marketplace relative to recent quarters or to improve employee productivity or for some other reason?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","We've been on the path of this digital transformation really for years, if we think back to the fact that we were one of the first 3PLs to really leverage the web and mobile applications to communicate with both customers and carriers while also being focused on enhancing internal processes to be more automated.","In terms of the current context, what I would think about in terms of our digital transformation is really this concept of journeys, and thinking about our customer journey, thinking about the carrier journey, from an order-to-cash cycle, as well as the employee journey and how they get work done. So, we're focused on how we can reduce and remove as much friction from these journeys as possible, while still meeting the customers and carriers where and how they want to interact with us.","So, we're looking at how we can enable trade by using advanced analytics and science in areas where historically we've relied on human decision support and manual processes. And this isn't about replacing all the personal interaction that so many of our customers and carriers appreciate, but really building better workflows for all stakeholders in a manner that reduces costs, increases efficiency, and improves quality. So, this isn't about just the next great mobile app. It's more about reengineering how we get work done in the context of leading-edge technology really enhancing the work of our people and our processes.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks. The next question is also for Bob. Ben Hartford with R. W. Baird asked how quickly do you expect Robinson Fresh EBIT margins to normalize after the first quarter customer loss and margin pressure?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Much of the Robinson Fresh transportation business was repriced in the first quarter and will be implemented throughout the course of the second quarter. We expect this to have positive impact to EBIT margins; however, I think it's important to point out one of the differences between Robinson Fresh transportation and NAST transportation, and that's that they tend to have a much more concentrated customer base, and tend to lean more heavily towards contractual relationships when compared to the broader NAST business. So, given a continuing rising rate environment and expected increase in costs and purchase transportation, this will serve as a headwind to Robinson Fresh in the coming quarters. As we stated on the call, we have also exited a couple of facilities, which will drive down cost savings in that business. And we've implemented some pretty stringent cost controls around our variable expenses within Robinson Fresh.","Related to the specific customer loss that we mention in the release, this will lapse during the second half of the year between Q3 and Q4. And, overall, will have less than a 1% impact on Robinson Fresh total net revenue for the year.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks. One more question for Bob, from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. What is leading LTL growth within transportation? Are you offering new services?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","LTL has been a great story in North America. And, frankly, one that we probably don't talk enough about. In 2015, we acquired Freightquote in order to gain more efficient access to that small and micro segment of customers that focus on LTL shipping. And since that time, we've combined the strengths of the legacy Robinson business, as well as the legacy Freightquote business, to really build an industry leading platform for LTL shipping that meets the needs of a full spectrum of customers, from the smallest micro shipper to the large global companies. Through technology and process integration, we've made it really easy for our customers to manage their LTL business with Robinson, whether that customer that ships once per quarter or the most complex global companies.","So, our customer mix and our service mix within LTL spans the size segments and also spans the service continuum. So we think that our ability to blend really compelling common carrier LTL service, as well as our own consolidation network and temperature controlled LTL, as well as parcel, continues to be a really nice differentiator for us in that business. It's a highly automated and highly efficient business for Robinson.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks Bob. Next question is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Andy, in Managed Services, what were the primary drivers of the 40-basis point operating margin expansion in the quarter?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah, our Managed Services business, which the brands are TMC and Freightview, they've done a great job and are an important part of our go-to-market strategy with our customers. As Bob mentioned, it's a SaaS based business, and they grew their freight under management to nearly $1 billion in the first quarter. So they're performing really well. Because of their processes that they put in place, they're able to bring on customers and grow revenue in a pretty efficient manner because it's longer-term contracts with recurring annual revenue of once you bring them in, you're able to operate that business more efficiently. So, both of those teams, TMC and Freightview have done a great job of bringing in customers in a very cost-effective manner.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. And our last question is from Ben Hartford of R. W. Baird. Bob, what are your expectations for head count across NAST, Global Forwarding, and Robinson Fresh for the balance of 2018?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So, I think I stated it on the call that we anticipate NAST head count to be flat for 2018 compared to year-end 2017. Global Forwarding head count will show up continuing to be inflated due to the Milgram acquisition and other investments, but we do anticipate that as we look forward sequentially, that will flatten out or decline throughout the balance of this year. Within Robinson Fresh, we look for Robinson Fresh head count to be down on a year-over- year basis throughout the balance of 2018.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. That concludes the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. A replay of the call will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com at approximately 11:30 a.m. Eastern time today.

(NASDAQ:CHRW) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call February  4, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Tim Gagnon \u2013 Director of Investor Relations","John Wiehoff \u2013 Chief Executive Officer","Chad Lindbloom \u2013 Chief Financial Officer and Chief Information Officer","Operator","Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson Fourth Quarter 2014 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today\u2019s presentation, Tim Gagnon will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 4, 2015.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, the Director of Investor Relations.","Tim Gagnon","Thank you and good morning everyone. On our call this morning will be John Wiehoff, Chief Executive Officer; and Chad Lindbloom, Chief Financial and Chief Information Officer. John and Chad will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our fourth quarter and year end. We\u2019ll follow that with a response to pre-submitted questions that we\u2019ve received after our earnings release yesterday.","Please note there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate the discussion. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Chad will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments.","I\u2019d like to remind you that comments made by John, Chad or others representing C.H Robinson may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management\u2019s expectations.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments on Slide 3 with a review of our fourth quarter and year-end 2014 results.","John Wiehoff","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. So as you can see on Page 3 with our results for the fourth quarter, we had a very solid fourth quarter and finished what we believe was a very strong year in 2014.","Looking at some of the key financial metrics on that Slide 3, for the fourth quarter our gross revenues increased 6.5%, net revenues increased by 12.9%. We\u2019ll get into the components of that as we always do but the most of the net revenue growth was driven by Truckload and Global Forwarding services.","For the fourth quarter, the income from operations increased 21.5%, and net income increased 21%. Later on in the presentation we\u2019ll cover some of the expense management and changes in some of the expense items, but obviously we were pleased with the fact that our income from operations was able to grow faster than our net revenues for the quarter.","As it has been the case throughout 2014 largely because of our share repurchases, our diluted EPS grew faster than our net income or income from operations. EPS growth in the quarter was 24.2%. I do want to share some comments about the year-to-date numbers as well too, particularly as a reminder when you think about C.H Robinson that because so much of our cost structure is driven by personnel expense and significant part of our personnel expense is based upon annual incentives and annual contracts. The year-to-date numbers and the annual numbers really are over a longer period of time probably the best way to understand and study the metrics.","So, looking at some of those 12 months or calendar year 2014 financial metrics, the gross revenues were up 5.6% to $13.4 billion which was a new record high for us. The record net revenues of $2 billion was another milestone that we were anxious to achieve, and it was pleased that we are able to reach that this year. If you look at our income from operations growth for the year of 9.6% to $748 million, I guess one of the key metrics that we like to highlight there is that our income from operations was able to grow faster than our net revenues for the calendar year as well too.","Again, Chad will cover some of the personnel numbers, but that growth in income from operations was despite the return of some pretty meaningful increases in our variable compensation plans. So when we look at the year-to-date results, we feel very positive about our business model, and how it continues to share the variable performance with all of the stakeholders including shareholders and employees.","Earlier this year, in several of our calls, we\u2019ve talked about our goal of leveraging our past investments of talent that we had made into the network. On that Slide 3, you can see our average and ending headcounts of our team for the year. One of the things that we\u2019re very proud of is that we were able to achieve our results during 2014 with the relatively consistent amount of people on our team. And it is a combination of some market condition changes. How we adapted to them and really leveraging the team and the business platform that we had in place to drive some good results for 2014. So we feel like it was a great quarter and a good year and we\u2019re proud of our results for 2014.","Turning to Slide 4, and starting to break down those overall results, again I\u2019d like to start with total transportation, which is the majority of the business. Every time we speak to the total transportation growth and net revenue margin is probably appropriate to remind you that there are a lot of factors that impact this. So after this slide, we\u2019ll get into the various service lines and try to break it down further.","Couple of constant themes, when we look at the overall net revenue margins is that across virtually all of the services, there is a common theme of capacity constraints. Falling fuel prices is another theme that we\u2019ll touch on and a couple of the different services and the impact on that, and then also our change in the mix of our business, when we get into the different transportation services. We\u2019ll talk about our length of haul, we\u2019ll talk about truck versus rail and a number of items that impact the mix that impact these net revenue margins.","While there is a lot going on this page. I do think it is usual to look at it, in terms of an enterprise view of our net revenue margins. Particularly, as we continue to move more into integrated services and multi-modal solutions, that there are more and more tradeoffs and interrelated parts to the different transportation offerings. As you can see the net revenue margin for total transportation for the quarter was 15.8%, which compares favorably to a year ago of 15% and it\u2019s down from 16.1% in the third quarter of this year.","Moving along then to Page 5, and focusing in on our truckload results. Our truckload net revenue for the fourth quarter increased 15.3%. As you can see in the upper right hand side, volume for North America truckload transportation increased about 3% for the quarter. These results are fairly consistent with what we've seen the past couple of quarters and reflect what we've discussed in the past around our emphasis on adapting to the market changes during the year with more focus on pricing, and a little less emphasis on going after our long-term goal of gaining market share.","In that upper right hand corner of Page 5 as well that highlights how we think about our pricing in our margins that the approximate pricing to our customers during the quarter excluding the price of fuel increased around 12%, and the cost paid to the carriers around 11% which is what drove the net revenue increase in excess of the volume activity for the quarter.","As we\u2019ve talked in previous quarters, when we look at that approximate pricing there are a number of things that are going on within those calculations as well too. There is a mixture of business with both contractual and committed and spot market activity. Similar to what we\u2019ve shared in the past, a more common price increase on committed or contractual business would be something more in the mid-single-digits during the year where some of the contractual pricing could increase meaningfully more than that.","In addition, we continue to experience a shortening in the length of haul from a year-over-year standpoint, and the rate per mile on some of that shorter length of haul can have more significant increase as well.","Falling fuel prices were a factor again what I\u2019ve talked about so far is doing the best that we can to exclude the estimated costs and impacts of fuel on the pricing that we experienced during quarter. The declining price of fuel during the quarter and coming into the current year we\u2019ll come back and talk to that in the look ahead, as well as some of the Q&A, but just from a high level when we look at our truckload results, we do not believe that the falling fuel prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 had a material impact on our business. It does have a material impact on the gross revenues and the amounts that we are invoicing and both paying.","And we still continue to believe that over a longer period of time that fuel functions as a passthrough in our business. Similar to what we\u2019ve shared in the past, whenever fuel is moving significantly in either direction there can be an impact during the transition and we\u2019ll analyze that as best we can share some more thoughts later, but we do not believe that it was a material impact in the quarter.","Moving on then to Slide 6 and talking about our LTL results for the fourth quarter. Less than truckload net revenues increased 7.8% for the fourth quarter on approximately 4% volume increase. Similar to my comment earlier what we have seen in the LTL marketplaces that capacity has been relatively tight, and that prices have been increasing throughout the year. And similar to my comment on our truckload services, we have been a little bit more focused during 2014 on adjusting to those market changes and making certain that we are adapting to the right pricing model and serving our customers to get that capacity that they need as opposed to aggressively chasing market share during 2014.","As we move into 2015 again to look ahead I will come back with some prepared comments on our Freightquote acquisition, which closed as the first of the year. In 2015, if you recall the common themes or the headlines of the Freightquote acquisitions were that is a good business, it\u2019s very technology driven and it\u2019s very focused in LTL. So, we do expect organic growth from our core network in LTL, but we also expect to see some meaningful growth in the LTL net revenue results in 2015 from the Freightquote acquisition. What you can see as for the year 2014 that $258 million of net revenue in LTL represents about 13% of our net revenue, which has continued to become a slightly greater percentage of the mix over the last decade or so.","Moving on then to Slide 7, and our intermodal results, Intermodal net revenue increased 3.8% in the fourth quarter and volume was up approximately 1% for the quarter. Again, fairly consistent messages and themes with the past couple of quarters, we continue to feel very comfortable with our service levels and our execution capability.","We are doing some operational improvements that are helping our net revenues and feel like managing our capacity and equipment better. Rail capacity and train speeds continue to be a challenge in the comparisons of offering this service versus truckload. The conjunction at the West ports also introduce some operational challenge with intermodal. But despite all of that we continue to feel very good about our operational capability and our service offering in the marketplace.","Our biggest challenge in intermodal that we think we have been very upfront about is that it has been challenging to find ways to aggressively grow the business, while maintaining the high return on invested capital that we\u2019d like to have. So, we will continue to keep looking for better opportunities to aggressively grow intermodal, but feel comfortable with that as part of our service offering.","Moving to Slide 8, and talking about our Global Forwarding Air, Ocean, and customs results for the fourth quarter. The combined results for the Global Forwarding services was an 18.4% increase in the fourth quarter over the fourth quarter of 2013. The strong second half of the year helped us finish year-to-date with a 10.7% net revenue increase for these combined services. The growth was led by ocean with a net revenue increase of 22.8% in the quarter, and an air increase of 7.9%, customs brokerage was up 16.8%.","In our Global Forwarding services, as you recall a little more than two years ago, we made a very significant investment with the acquisition of Phoenix International to drive greater growth and improved service in our Global Forwarding division. At that time, we talked about the fact that we had a lot of integration work to do, and that we were going to take a very long-term focus to building a strong foundation, in retaining our customers and retaining our people in our Global Forwarding business.","I feel really good about the first two years of integration and our success in growing our Global Forwarding business. We feel very good about the caliber of the team, almost all of the integration work has been completed over the last couple of years. We have a very solid network with a good leadership team in place and some very good processes and procedures that have improved our Global Forwarding offering.","The primary area where we still have some continued work is in regard to the IT systems and we think that there is some opportunity that continued to improve some of our business processes in our Global Forwarding activities, but the first two years have been very positive and we feel great about how we\u2019ve improved our competitive presence in the network around the world.","Moving on then to Slide 9, our other logistics services for the quarter, again, as a reminder this includes our transportation management services, warehousing, small parcel and some other miscellaneous non-transportation services that we provide. Net revenues for the quarter increased 4%, net revenues for the year increased 7.6%.","In 2014, we finished below our longer-term growth target of 10% for these services; however, the pipeline continues to look really good. There was some transition in some of those services and some customer activity. But the pipeline looks great and we continue to feel that this is going to be a very important part of our business going forward particularly with regards to integrating services and creating a lot of innovation outside of our core transportation services.","As we\u2019ve said in many past quarters, these \u2013 almost all of these other logistics services are heavily inter-twined with the meaningful amount of our transportation revenue probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% of our transportation revenue that is overlapping with these customers.","Moving then to Slide 10, in our sourcing results for the fourth quarter of 2014, net revenue decreased 7% for the quarter and we finished down 9% for the year. We\u2019ve talked throughout 2014 about the changes in our sourcing business with the mix of larger customer changes some of the weather related issues and the other things that have impact the turnover in our results.","We have a good sourcing team in place and they are working hard to deliver better results in 2015 and we do have a plan to grow our net revenue in 2015, back to our longer-term target of more of mid-single digit net revenue growth. So we feel that this is an important part of our business, as I\u2019ve mentioned many times in the past. The buying and selling of our fresh fruits and vegetables is very integrated into our temperature controlled transportation services. And there are a lot of very effective customer solution offerings that are offered through this team. And we are optimistic about the future that there are opportunities to grow and create value in this service line as well within Robinson.","So that concludes the overview of the services we offer, our margins and our results for the quarter. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Chad, for some comments on our income statement.","Chad Lindbloom","Thanks, John. As John mentioned, I\u2019ll begin on Slide 11, which is our summarized income statement. As John mentioned earlier in the overview, our total net revenues were up 13% for the fourth quarter, and our operating income was up 21%. When you look at our personnel expenses for the quarter, they increased approximately 15% or $32 million. Of that $32 million increase approximately $29 million was caused by increased incentive compensation.","Our equity compensation was up $16 million for the quarter compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter, and our cash and other incentive plans were up $13 million. Our average headcount was slightly down at 0.6% for the fourth quarter. So basically, the overall increase in our compensation expense during the quarter was driven by those incentive plans that we\u2019ve talked about all the year, that we're extremely low last year and are coming back.","Year-to-date some similar metrics, our total personnel increase was a $112 million, $79 million of that was from increased incentive compensation made up of $38 million and that increase in equity expense and $41 million in cash and other incentive programs. Our incentive compensation philosophy and plans have stayed relatively consistent with previous years. The increase is based on our increased net revenues and earnings growth. Last year our incentives were extremely low due to the lack of earnings growth.","Moving on to the other SG&A line, which decreased about 7.6% for the quarter. This was driven primarily by reductions in our provisions for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense was $5.3 million in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, and we experienced a credit of approximately $800,000 or a negative expense in this year\u2019s fourth quarter, for an improvement of $6 million.","We expect this expense to fluctuate from period-to-period. It is influenced by specific customer issues, our aging in the quality of our accounts receivable portfolio, in the size of our accounts receivable portfolio. We had a great collection quarter and no significant issues with specific customers. For the year, our provision for doubtful accounts was $15.1 million this year, compared to $15.6 million last year, this level of expense relative to our gross revenues are within historic ranges.","Moving on to Slide 12, looking at our cash flow and some other balance sheet data. We had a strong free cash flow quarter with cash provided by operations of $208 million, and CapEx including software of $4.3 million. During 2015, we expect an increase in our total CapEx, we expected to be between $50 million or $55 million. Included in this estimate is building a second data center for disaster recovery.","We are currently we are outgrowing our current disaster recovery site, which is in Chicago. And we\u2019ll build another center similar to our current primary site. We expect to spend $15 million to $20 million on this site in 2015, and with some carryover CapEx into 2016 and planned to bring the site live in early 2016.","At the end of the quarter, we had $359 million in restricted cash. This was related to our purchase of Freightquote. Because the deal closed on January 1 and banks are closed on January 1. We had the funds held in Escrow, by an Escrow agent. Our debt balance including the borrowings related to the Freightquote purchase price was $1.1 billion.","Moving on to Slide 13, looking at our capital distribution. As we\u2019ve talked about our goal is to distribute 90% of our net income to our shareholders in most environments, while maintaining a debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the 1% to 1.5% range. This will vary the 90% total return of net income to shareholders, will vary based on our cash flow generations, needs for working capital and other capital needs.","For the right acquisition opportunity, we\u2019ve mentioned before that we \u2013 be willing to go up to 2.5 or 3 times debt-to-EBITDA in the future. During the quarter, we paid $57.4 million in cash dividends and spent $39.7 million as repurchasing shares. For the year, we fell slightly short of our 90% goal. We suspended share repurchase activities during November and didn\u2019t buy during December. This was due to the company having knowledge of the acquisition prior to public announcements, which precluded us from purchasing shares on the open market.","With that, I will turn it back to John for our closing prepared comments.","John Wiehoff","Okay. Our last slide, Page 14, is the look ahead where we try to share what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace and what we\u2019re thinking about 2015. If you look at the bullet points there, I think as we\u2019ve talked over the last several years about the changes in both secular issues, the competitive landscape, technology all of that and then the cyclical changes in the transportation marketplace pretty much comes down to looking at those two topics. And the first one around truckload performance it's 59% of our net revenue and I know that in terms of trying to understand what our future performance especially in the shorter-term might look like is to try to get a sense of what\u2019s happening in the truckload environment.","For the month of January in our legacy or traditional C.H Robinson truckload activity; we had net revenue growth approximating 15% which is very similar to what we\u2019ve experienced during the fourth quarter of 2014. We also had more modest volume growth in that same lower single-digit range for the month of January.","Those numbers exclude any impact of Freightquote, which we have some preliminary numbers, but wanted to do more quality control and understand before we start to talk about what those would do. The challenge this year even more so than past years, is we\u2019re fairly certain that the January results will not be indicative of what the remainder of the year holds.","Again, if you recall from a year-ago when we were sitting in the midst of the polar vertex and a very unusual January period of time, our net revenue had declined. And that was really throughout the remainder of the first quarter and into the second quarter when we begun to manage differently and reacts to the environment around adapting to pricing, increasing prices and looking at volume growth differently.","So, while the year is off to a great start from a net revenue standpoint, we know that over the next two to three months, we\u2019re going to see a meaningful change in our comparisons in terms of the margins that we\u2019ve incurred. And we also know that we\u2019ll see some difference in the comparison of the volume activity that we\u2019ve had.","But the time, we get till the end of the first quarter, get into the early part of the second quarter, if our net revenue margins remain consistent with what they\u2019ve been in the last couple of quarters, our net revenue growth would start to be closer to the volume activity that we have as opposed to benefiting from material year-over-year margin comparison.","Our margins can move up or down very quickly as we\u2019ve talked much so in the past, so again it\u2019s very difficult to predict and that\u2019s why, we\u2019re not really comfortable giving very specific guidance of what 2015 is going to look like. The month of January, what we do know now, was at the month of January was very similar to the fourth quarter, there will be probably another 3% to 4% of incremental growth from the truckload portion of the Freightquote net revenues that will roll in for the quarter and again that will be incremental from the acquisition as opposed to comparative year-over-year.","So that\u2019s all we know about, our January result at this point, we talked throughout the presentation before too, that volume growth and market share gains are at the foundation of our long-term growth initiatives and what we want to focus on. We do intend to continue to invest in talent during the year, and we know - we have known for quite some time now that after we cycled through 2014 and we feel very confident about the approach that we took that it was the right thing to do. But that over a longer period of time, we do need to focus more on adding talent to the team and more aggressively going after volume growth and market share in 2015 and beyond.","So we know that our margin comparisons will change over the next three or four months and we also know that over time we will continue to go back to more focus on volume growth. That\u2019s what we can share at this point about our truckload net revenues, margins cyclicality of where we are at. Turning back a little bit just to our longer-term strategic initiatives and what we\u2019re seeing just a few more comments on the Freightquote acquisition, as we mentioned a couple of times that closed the first of the year, very similar to what we\u2019ve done on any other acquisition in the past, we do intend to have a very long-term focus on our integration strategies and approach with Freightquote.","We feel like we are off to a good start, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time getting to learn each other\u2019s business and figuring out how the teams will work together. This acquisition and the integration will be very different than the Phoenix acquisition of two years ago. The employees are essentially in two locations in Kansas city and an office up here in Minneapolis and while there will be a fair amount of focus on the technology offerings and how we integrate systems and most importantly maybe how we segment customers and align ourselves to go to the market efficiently around all the different sizes and types of customers that we want.","There won\u2019t be a lot of the similar challenges that there were with Phoenix in having a 150 offices around the world and a lot of overlapping acquisitions and there are locations and sites, where we had to merge teams and create structure together. So we feel that it\u2019s off to a good start. We also feel that we\u2019ll be able to complete the integration of Freightquote within 2015 and be pretty efficient about \u2013 about how we get there.","Global trade expansion, we have talked in our Global Forwarding service section about the success that we\u2019ve had and putting the businesses together and penetrating the market with more market share. If you recall, both the foundation of our legacy forwarding business and Phoenix were heavily focused on Asia to North America in those trade lanes. We do feel that there is great opportunity to grow in that lane, but in addition focus more on Asia to Europe and North America to Europe to focus on building the other trade lanes as well as strengthening and focusing more on the air services with the higher percentage of our activity today being Ocean.","So we do feel like there is great opportunity for us to continue to expand globally and to really focus on forwarding some significant trade lanes. I touched on the fact that sales execution with all type of customers, as our industry has grown as we have grown, as things have become more competitive, we feel like we need to focus better and better on our segmentation strategies and make sure that we are adapting our approach and our goal to market strategies for the various types of customers that we interface with.","We have a lot of different initiatives including a very important small customer focus that\u2019s tied into the Freightquote acquisition, that we think will help us grow that segment. We\u2019ve talked in the past about the larger, more integrated customers and the account management strategies and supporting initiatives that we have with them. We feel very good about different verticals and some things that we\u2019re doing to improve our ability to add value to certain types of customers as well too.","Those are all are really important themes that you\u2019ll hear more about in the future and our important part of how we plan to grow our business. If we talk about the investments that we\u2019ll make talent technology and network, we\u2019ve talked about adding people, hiring employees and our talent remains the core of our business. There we\u2019ll continue to be more emphasis on that in 2015 with our ongoing focus of training and making sure that we have the right types of people to serve all those customers.","On the technology side, Chad mentioned, the infrastructure investments that just continues to be a more and more component of how we serve our customers and the value that we provide to them. In addition to the data center and the infrastructure, we will be spending record amounts on our programming and our software capabilities to make sure that we\u2019re expanding our capabilities and adjusting to our customer\u2019s needs. ","Integrating Freightquote and the e-commerce and digital presence is an important part of our technology strategy as well too. Network and network optimization there are a lot of initiatives that we have to improve and continue to drive how our offices work together around sharing freight and improving margins, there is parts of the world where we think, we can expand and open some offices and we have a lot of different initiatives to really improve the efficiency of our network and strengthen the global presence that we have. So those are core competencies of how we compete and things that we will continue to invest in 2015 and beyond.","The last bullet point in terms of looking ahead as \u2013 a little more than a year ago in the fall of 2013, we had an Investor Day and laid out our long-term expectations of how we thought we could grow and how we could create value in the future. That presentation remains on our website under the investor section with presentations, I\u2019d invite anybody to go back there and read revisit that, if you would like to. We put a lot of effort into that and continue to believe that it reflects a proper assessment of what our growth opportunities and our future can look like. Some of the highlights in there are that we did talk about double digit EPS growth being sustainable while it\u2019s going to fluctuate, we do think that\u2019s remains a reasonable long-term goal.","We are pleased that after a difficult start in 2014, that we were able to achieve 15% EPS growth in the first year of that revised long-term expectations. And in addition just a reminder of what I touched on earlier that, you really had crossed all of our services growing market share is an important part of our foundation and how we expect to create value.","We talked about our targeted long-term milestone of $25 billion of gross revenue. We\u2019ve reached over $13 billion this year and we think within the next 5 years to 10 years that $25 billion of revenues and market share in this very large logistics and transportation industry is a very doable goal. So, we feel very confident about our long-term strategy and the competitive advantages that we are investing in, in order to sustain our growth and we\u2019ve shared with you a number of initiatives that we\u2019ll be focusing in on more in the short-term to achieve those goals.","That concludes our prepared comments. And with that, I will turn it back to Tim to facilitate some of the Q&A that we have received.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. And we\u2019ll get right into the pre-submitted questions here. I\u2019d first take a minute to thank all the analyst and investors for taken the time to send us questions we\u2019ve received well over a 100 questions and have done our best to bring out variety of topics to the responses here in this morning. So, I will get right into our first question for Chad.","This declining fuel have any impact on your profitability either positively or negatively in the fourth quarter?","Chad Lindbloom","John covered some of those in his prepared remarks. But I\u2019ll try to give you a little bit of additional color. As we\u2019ve talked about before it\u2019s impossible to measure what precession for our truckload business, what the impacts if you are \u2013 however we believe over a long period of time, fuel does function as the passthrough. We have much of our business that done in an all-in price. The transactional business that\u2019s quite common on the customer side and when you look at the carrier procurement or the buy side approximately 80% to 90% of our capacity on truckload is hired on an all-in price. As John mentioned, we don\u2019t think there was a major impact on our profitability from fuel in quarter four.","Prices to customers for fuel adjust automatically in the lot of cases. All of our contractual business has fuel surcharges that adjust primarily on a weekly basis. However, in times of volatility, we can be helped or hurt as timing differences occur between the buy and the sell.","In this type of environment, it is difficult and we could be hurt by the decline in prices as carriers today are looking basically for more money for their line haul. They\u2019re very quick to ask for more money when fuel is increasing and when fuel is decreasing especially in a relatively type market like we\u2019re in now. They\u2019re holding more from on pricing.","So going forward, it will be difficult to predict what that impact will be in the short-term but eventually like we\u2019ve always said, we think over a longer period of time, fuel will be in access of passthrough on our truckload business.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, Chad. And a second question for John relates to Freightquote. Have you with passage of time; refined your thoughts regarding both cost and marketing synergies. What role if any have you carved out for Tim Gagnon going forward?","John Wiehoff","When we think about integrated Freightquote, I touched on this briefly but the headline themes our technology, LTL and small customers. So, in terms of the technology side of it we\u2019re very excited about the expanded capabilities that we got with Freightquote and we think there is going to be some marketing synergies in terms of how we go to market with their small customer offering and blend that in with Freightquote. From a cost standpoint, that business is going to remain fairly standalone in terms of its site and its team so we wouldn\u2019t expect a lot of cost savings in the short-term probably the bigger short-term opportunity is that in the truckload portion of Freightquote while they\u2019ve done a effective job of integrating their go-to-market strategy into those small customers for both LTL and truckloads services. We do feel that our procurement capability on the truckloads side can hopefully add value in the shorter-term and help with some other truckload margins and truckload capacity procurement stuff. And hopefully, those improved truckload margins along with improved operating efficiency by sourcing that capacity more effectively would have a positive impact on some of the net revenues as well as the operating expenses. For the most part, we are viewing this as an opportunity to gain share and an opportunity to more effectively go after that small customer segment as well strengthen our LTL offering.","With regards to Tim Barton for those of you who may not be familiar, he was the founder of Freightquote started the business in 1999 and has a very strong technology background, so he has been very much key part of the business over the last 16 or 17 years, even prior to our acquisition Tim had removed himself from a lot of the day-to-day activity and had the desire going forward to have a little bit more personal freedom for some other things. ","So we have entered into a consulting agreement with Tim, he is going to be available for Matt Roland, the President down there in our leadership team to help whenever or however necessary in terms of the Freightquote business and the integration of that. And we also have some other strategic initiatives that he is going to be assisting us with primarily in the managed services and technology areas to help us sort out what\u2019s the best approach going to be going forward. So he will be acting as a consultant for a year or two to help us integrate and learn about our business and help us figure out some strategic things and then where we access from there in terms of what the role will be in.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John, next question for Chad. You\u2019ve been very clear that he planned to add talent in 2015, as you are ramping headcount, do you expect your personnel expenses to grow faster than net revenue in 2015?","Chad Lindbloom","Okay. As we\u2019ve mentioned during the year, we are at all time high especially in North America truck productivity levels, when we look at volumes per person. Therefore we do expect to grow heads to support our future volume growth. Headcount growth should approximate, but hopefully be a little slower than volume growth over time. Personnel expenses should also grow roughly in line with this volume growth assuming consistent net revenue margins. ","Obviously, there will be fluctuations between in our net revenue margins going forward, but our variable incentive compensation makes up for some of that margin fluctuation. So we can\u2019t say that will grow perfectly in \u2013 that personnel expense will grow perfectly in line with net revenues. But we expected to approximate our net revenue growth over time, again there will be periods like we experienced this year where in micro faster and there\u2019s also been periods in the past and different parts of the economic and growth cycles where it\u2019s growing slower.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, Chad, next question for John. Last year in the first quarter the trucking industry faced an unusual environment as adverse weather throughout much of the U.S impacted volumes, capacity and spot pricing. Will this creating any unusual comparisons or volumes, net revenue margins that investor should be aware of, when you report first quarter 2015 results.","John Wiehoff","I touched on this briefly earlier, but it\u2019s more than enough to probably get into, again I just reiterate that last year first quarter was very unusual, it started out very difficult with negative net revenue declines. By the month of March, we actually had some fairly decent results and had been adapting to the marketplace with pricing changes and improving things, also the weather has started to improve by then. So it makes it very difficult to understand what the first quarter and aggregate will look like, but we do expect that things will change meaningfully throughout the quarter in terms of our comparisons to the prior year, and then as we get into the second and third quarters. We will be comparing to those higher margins as well and be adapting to whatever changes happen this year.","Tim Gagnon","Thank John, next question for Chad. What is your expected tax rate for 2015?","Chad Lindbloom","Assuming no changes our tax reform. We expect our rate to be 38% to 38.5%, when you look at the plans of broadening the base and reducing the rate that would have a significant increase to our earnings by a reduction of our income tax expense, as we have very few special incentives on today\u2019s tax environment.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks Chad. Next question for John on the sourcing business. I realized that there are weather related issues that impact the sourcing business. But did that closer to be a more stable year-over-year net revenue growth rate business, at this point?","John Wiehoff","That is our plan, as I mentioned earlier that there has been a lot of challenge in the sourcing area both with weather and with churn and dedicated customer business, but we do feel very good about our ability to add value in that space and provide growth and that we believe there in 2015 our plan would be for year-over-year net revenue growth.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks John. Next question for Chad. Did you have any M&A expenses in the fourth quarter related to the Freightquote acquisition?","Chad Lindbloom","Our efforts around the Freightquote acquisition were primarily internal expenses. We did not engage in an investment banker. However, we did have about $500,000 of professional fees primarily for lawyers and the accountants for due diligence and the negotiation of the merger agreement. ","Tim Gagnon","Thanks Chad. Next question for John. On the forwarding side, can you highlight a few key trade lanes, where you plan to add density in the coming years, either via M&A or organic growth opportunities?","John Wiehoff","I did touch on this briefly a little bit earlier, but Asia to Europe is a core corridor or trade lanes where we think we can have some meaningful growth this year, also with the meaningful movements in currency. We think there might be some opportunities to look at some of the trade lanes where there would be more export activity out of Europe or to Europe and North America back and forth.","So, in addition to that, what I mentioned earlier around the air freight offering that if you look at our Global Forwarding offering today execute more towards the Ocean activity from Asia to North America. So, we feel that there are air opportunities in a number of lanes around the world that we can grow in.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question for Chad, CHRW plans to increase the return of cash to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks. Can you provide the framework you plan to use what dividend payout ratio? Are you targeting how much debt are you comfortable with either measured by debt to EBITDA or debt to capitalization?","John Wiehoff","Okay. I covered a lot of this in my prepared comments, but our targeted dividend pay-out ratio remains at 45%. Our share repurchase activities again will vary based on our cash flow generation with targeting the 90% total return to shareholders. As far as our debt capacity we set through normal ongoing capital distributions, we want to stand to 1 to 1.5 times range but we would be comfortable going up to 2.5 to 3.0 times debt to EBITDA for the rate acquisition opportunity.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks and again for Chad, you outlined a 7% to 12% long-term EPS growth target at your Investor day but your press release and slides referenced double-digit EPS growth goal. So, wondering if you\u2019re officially increasing your long-term outlook if so, what is the basis for the increased confidence? Does it have to do with the Freightquote acquisition or other acquisition plans or a general improvement in market conditions or you\u2019re positioning?","Chad Lindbloom","As John mentioned in his prepared comments, we restated our growth goals from the Investor day. Our Investor day slide on long-term growth targets which I think in Slide 9, the first bullet point on that slide states our goal is double digit EPS growth. You are correct that we did set \u2013 state a targeted range of 7% to 12% EPS growth which 10 is roughly the midpoint of that range.","We gave a range to make it clear that we expect volatility in the growth rate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We still feel good about the goals we set during that presentation and feel that we should be able to achieve these goals over time. Again, some quarters and some years we'll do better in some quarters and some areas. We want \u2013 want to achieve double-digit EPS growth.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Another question for Chad here, can you provide some color around the decline in D&A, the decline in bad debt in any one-time expense related to the Freightquote deal?","Chad Lindbloom","Sure. The depreciation and amortization declines compared to last year we're do primarily to some acquisition amortization running out this year from previous deals. Beginning it\u2019s important to remember though that beginning in quarter one. We will have additional amortization expense for Freightquote. We are in the process of our purchase price allocation and our work to get an appraisal done. But based on previous deals, we would expect that amortization from the Freightquote acquisition to be somewhere in the $11 million to $13 million per year range.","Moving on to bad debt expense that fluctuates as I mentioned based on our aging and the size of our accounts receivable portfolio and any customers specific issues. The aging improved during the quarter and the amount of our accounts receivable decreased during the quarter, compared to the end of the third quarter. As I mentioned there were no significant account specific issues during the quarter, which led to a low expense for the quarter actually in credit for the quarter. It does vary from quarter-to-quarter and the fourth quarter was a very good collection quarter. We collected some money, some old money that had been previously reserved.","As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re moving on to the question about the Freightquote cost. I think, I have already answered that that we had about $500,000 of outside spend. The rest of the effort was primarily with the internal resources.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks Chad. Next question for John, would you please update us on the development of the European Truck brokerage effort has the sluggish economic growth in Europe changed your view regarding the potential of this opportunity?","John Wiehoff","Our European truck brokerage business represents about 4% of the net revenue of the truckload net revenues and in that investor deck and in our past we\u2019ve talked about believing that the European continent provides an equal opportunity for growth and platform that we could have a business very similar to our North American truckload services.","We have not changed that long-term view in terms of the opportunity. However, the economic growth in the environment in Europe today has impacted our attitude about the pace and how aggressively we\u2019ll go after share during this period of time. Very similar to what we\u2019ve talked about in North America over the last year or so, we\u2019ve been added in Europe for maybe a little over 20 years and there are different environments that are better for going after share and different environments for providing service for those of who may not be familiar with it there \u2013 in addition to the slow growth and decline there actually have been declining truckload prices in Europe in the last couple of years.","And when we look at opening offices and aggressively going after share, a slow growth, no growth, declining price environment can be very challenging, like we very expensive essentially they go after market share very aggressively during that period of time. So we are doing that, we are opening offices, we are investing in our foundation and we have very long-term goals that will continue to become a more and more meaningful piece of our business. But we have tried to be realistic and adjust our pace of openings in our investment spending to make sure that we\u2019re adapting to the environment in Europe as well as North America.","Tim Gagnon","Okay, thanks, John, next question again for you. Forwarding performed very well in the fourth quarter, can you give us a sense of CHRW has already realized all of the benefits from better buy rates related to Phoenix acquisition or should we expect further benefits in 2015?","John Wiehoff","So when we think about the benefits of the deal particularly around the buy side and most of that to-date has been in ocean, really in 2013, we were able to capture a lot of the benefit of the combined contracts in any sort of procurement leverage around scale and getting the best contracting environment. So you are one probably have some of that improvement in there. A big part of the net revenue are margin opportunity in tales the optimized routing of making sure that each box is getting on the right steamship line and that each customer is being served in the optimal way. We got better at that the last couple of years, but I think there is opportunity to continue to do that more in the future around operational improvement, process improvement and lot of that is supported by the technology that we still have some more work to do on.","Lastly, there are very meaningful margin opportunities in consolidation activity and very similarly, I think, we have very good competitive line haul prices today, but in both area in ocean the smarter we can be and the more effective we can be at consolidating freight and routing things properly, there will be more margin opportunity there. So we\u2019ve already seen significant amounts of benefits, but through operational improvements, systems improvements, better data management we do hope to continue to drive more efficiency and more margin opportunity in the next couple of years.","Tim Gagnon","Next question again for John, can you comment on the CFO search when would you expect to have a new CFO in place?","John Wiehoff","We do have a search firm engaged to as out actively in the marketplace right now, looking for candidates, we expect to have somebody in place by the spring. As we\u2019ve talked about before we are making these changes from a longer term perspective around strengthening the team and adding to the talent that we already have. So we feel like we are in a good spot today with the strong finance team and we\u2019re going to make sure that we take whatever time it takes to get the right person on Board and strengthen the team of Robinson, but we\u2019ve had hope over the next couple of months and by spring time to have that process completed.","Tim Gagnon","Okay, thanks John. Next question again for you, 2014 seem to have a focus of allocating resources towards more profitable freight rather than just volume. How does that balance between the two feel for 2015?","John Wiehoff","Probably touched on this in a variety of ways, but obviously moving back towards a little bit more aggressive approach in truckload for sure around going after market share. Some of the other services we have been little bit more aggressive towards market share especially forwarding like I just touched on. As I\u2019ve mentioned in a variety of spots, a lot of \u2013 what is appropriate has to do with adapting to the current market condition.","So it\u2019s our sense today that of capacity remains tight, that pricing will continue to escalate in that, hopefully the environment will be conducive for us to invest in our team and continue to go after market share a little bit more aggressively during 2015. The things can change in a hurry as we learned a year ago and depending upon, what might happen in the market. We may have to adapt more because it\u2019s a constant assessment of what those market conditions are but at the current plan, we feel like we can start to move more aggressively into investing in our team and going after market share like we have for several years prior to this 2014.","Tim Gagnon","Okay, thanks John, again to you here a question about capacity. Do you see any near term solution to the driver issues, where it could create more capacity? ","John Wiehoff","We do have the general industry view that capacity on the truckload side is going to remain tight for an extended period of time. The solution in our view has always been a fairly straight forward formula, that it just takes compensation adjustments to our pricing changes to attract capacity to the marketplace. New equipment costs more and driver\u2019s wages need to increase meaningfully in order to attract more drivers to the industry.","I think the types of price increases that we saw in 2014 are a healthy start in that movement or in that direction. And it will take more of that in order to continue to attract drivers to the industry. From what we see around data points of new truck offering or new truck purchases and capacity availability in the marketplace, maybe there are some early signs of that starting to happen, but if we do continue to have increases in economic growth and freight demand. We\u2019ll need to see a lot more of that in order to provide the capacity that the marketplace needs.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks John. The next question around the acquisitions, what's your M&A appetite following your acquisition of Freightquote? Do you plan to fully integrate Freightquote before pursuing additional M&A opportunities?","John Wiehoff","As I mentioned earlier, I do believe that the integration process for Freightquote will be quicker and in many ways simpler than our Phoenix acquisition. So, while we do have a culture that says, we\u2019re going to finish one project before we jump into the next one. I do feel like our opportunities to look at further acquisitions will come quicker and that by the later part of this year, if the right opportunity came along, we would be interested in pursuing that. In addition, the Freightquote was very meaningful business, it is concentrated in the smaller segment of customers in their other parts of our business in forwarding our managed services, where we could be acquisitive and not really impact or overlap with any of that acquisition.","So, with \u2013 there are some consideration for the integration resources and probably more like in the first half of 2015. And we will continue to look for the right types of high quality acquisitions, even during 2015 to continue to grow the business.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question for Chad, does CHRW have any meaningful cost levers remaining to pull? What drives\u2019 margins higher from here? Is it possible to drive further cost from the network or does further margin improvement now depend on volume increases in pricing?","Chad Lindbloom","We\u2019re always managing the business to look for ways to drive cost efficiency, leveraging our people more investing in technology and things like that. We feel really proud about the progress we\u2019ve made over the last 15 years, but as we\u2019ve been talking about for the last couple, we don\u2019t expect the operating margins to expand as much as they did over that period of time.","Going forward, the primary driver of future earnings growth will be net revenue growth. Margins fluctuate over time, but the primary driver of net revenue growth will be volume growth. And as we mentioned earlier, we\u2019re at pretty high productivity levels right now. We will try to find ways to make our people more productive, but we do expect cost to grow inline, but hopefully, slightly slower than our net revenues over the long period of time going forward.","Tim Gagnon","Okay, thanks, Chad. And this will be the last question here, it\u2019s to John. Are you seeing any increase in the availability of capacity from the small independent owner operators? I think, higher base rates in lower fuel might increase the attractiveness of the business, I\u2019m wondering, if there are any signs of capacity coming into the market?","John Wiehoff","I\u2019ve touched on this briefly with the previous question that we do see some opportunities or some changes of capacity coming into the marketplace, but it gets very early in the change in that cycle. In early 2015, January is always a spotty time in terms of lower \u2013 overall lower freight demand and generally a less tightness in the marketplace, so there were some periods even during the current month where capacity seem to be more available, but that\u2019s probably more a function of January and yearly cyclicality rather than indicative of overall more capacity coming into the marketplace. But, as I stated earlier it's pretty much supply and demand and driven by pricing and with the types of activity that we saw during 2014. It\u2019s very intuitive that you would see more people choosing this as a carrier profession and that those new orders of trucks will trickle down into the medium and small carriers as well too and that we will see continuation of available capacity from moment.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks, John. And unfortunately, we are out of time and we apologies that we couldn\u2019t get to all the questions today. We thank everyone for participating in our fourth quarter and year end call.

Robinson First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, Bob Houghton will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, May 1st, 2019.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Bob Houghton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Bob Houghton","Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bob Biesterfeld, Chief Operating Officer and Scott Hagen, Corporate Controller and Interim Chief Financial Officer. John, Bob and Scott will provide commentary on our 2019 first quarter results. Presentation Slides that accompany their remarks can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com. We will follow that with responses to the pre-submitted questions we received after earnings release yesterday.","I would like to remind you that Robinson Fresh transportation results are now included in our North American Surface Transportation segment. The remaining Robinson Fresh results, which primarily include the sourcing and marketing of fresh produce, will be reported under the All Other and Corporate category.","To provide a basis for comparison, we have provided certain historical segment information under the new segment organization in our press release issued on April 1st. I would also like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide two in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.","And with that, I will turn the call over to John.","John Wiehoff","Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. For the quarter, we achieved high single-digit net revenue growth and double-digit growth in both operating income and earnings per share.","Operating margin improved 250 basis points in the quarter. Our North American Surface Transportation business generated double-digit net revenue growth and we delivered significant operating margin expansion in both our NAST and Global Forwarding businesses.","We also expanded our Global Forwarding presence in Spain and Colombia with the acquisition of The Space Cargo Group. We continued to make improvements in working capital, which combined with increased earnings, allowed us to generate over $250 million in cash flow from operations and increased cash returns to our shareholders. We feel good about our first quarter results and they are in line with our longer-term goals and expectations.","I also would like to highlight a couple of the macro themes and how they impact our business. The first theme is around pricing. In the back half of 2017 and into 2018, we had meaningful price increases in all of our services, including unprecedented increases in truckload.","So far this year, we are seeing pricing and cost declines in many of our service lines, including truckload. Many public data sources are indicating that we are in a softer market today than we were a year ago or even last quarter, and our view of the market is consistent with that public data.","Demand has been softening and that has resulted in cost of hire declines and price declines. Although a growing percentage of our capacity is strategically planned and procured, we purchased the majority of our North American truckload capacity in the spot market. So our pricing is generally reflective of overall market conditions. We are also seeing a modest increase in truckload capacity.","With less than 3% market share in each of our transportation service lines, we do not lead the market lower, but with meaningful scale, we are typically a reflection of the market, both in terms of pricing and in our contractual versus transactional mix. When markets are balanced, customers typically engage us in more contractual volume and when markets are tight, more of our volumes move to transactional freight.","One of our network's greatest strengths is adapting to changing market conditions. We view it as our primary job to help our customers and carrier partners understand current conditions and manage through cycles with high levels of execution, and we feel good about how we are positioned to continue to do that.","Regardless of the freight cycle, we are focused on taking market share, achieving operating leverage and improving cash flow. We are confident in our long-term value creation strategy and in our ability to continue to win in the marketplace.","With those introductory comments, I will now turn it over to Scott Hagen, our Corporate Controller and Interim CFO, to review our financial statements.","Scott Hagen","Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. Slide four shows our financial results for the quarter. First quarter total revenues decreased 4.4% to $3.8 billion, driven by lower pricing across most of our transportation service lines and volume declines in air. Total Company net revenues increased 8.4% in the quarter to $679 million, primarily from margin improvements in our truckload service line.","First quarter monthly net revenue per business day was up 9% in both January and February, and up 13% in March. Total operating expenses increased $20 million, a 4.6% increase when compared to the prior year. Personnel expenses increased 3.6%, primarily due to a 1.9% increase in average headcount as performance-based compensation, including equity and bonus were relatively flat compared to last year.","The addition of Space Cargo contributed about 0.5 percentage point to the headcount growth. The organic headcount growth rate remained consistent with the growth rate in the fourth quarter.","SG&A expenses were up 7.6% in the quarter to $114 million. The primary drivers were increased purchased services, particularly expenses related to the integration of purchased software and from claims and occupancy. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense.","Total operating income was $225 million in the first quarter, up 17.2% over last year. Operating margin increased 250 basis points versus last year, representing our fourth consecutive quarter of operating margin expansion.","Achieving operating margin leverage remains a top priority for C.H. Robinson. First quarter net income was $162 million, an increase of 13.7% versus last year. Our diluted earnings per share was $1.16 in the first quarter, up 14.9% from $1.01 last year.","Slide 5 covers other income statement items. The first quarter effective tax rate was 22%, up from 21.3% last year. We typically experience the lowest quarterly effective tax rate in the first quarter of each year, primarily from deliveries related to our incentive stock program. We expect our full-year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 25%.","First quarter interest and other expense totaled $17.1 million, up from $10.7 million last year. Interest expense was $13.7 million in the quarter, up $2.4 million from the prior year, primarily due to a higher weighted average interest rate.","A majority of the remainder of the increase in expense is related to currency, with the biggest impact coming from revaluation of foreign working capital and cash balances to functional currency.","The U.S. dollar weakened against several of our key currencies this quarter, including the Chinese RMB. Movements in currency will continue to have an impact on our quarterly net income and we will continue to break out of this impact in future quarters.","Our share count in the quarter was down 1.6%, as share repurchases were partially offset by the impact of activity in our equity compensation plans.","Turning to Slide 6, we had another quarter of strong cash generation. Cash flow from operations totaled $257 million in the first quarter, up 28% versus last year, representing the fifth consecutive quarter with double-digit growth. A combination of improved working capital performance and increased earnings drove the cash flow improvement.","Capital expenditures totaled $13.9 million for the quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be between $80 million and $90 million for the full-year, with the increased spending primarily dedicated to technology. We returned $146 million to shareholders in the quarter through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, a 9% increase versus the prior year first quarter.","We will continue to evaluate and deploy our capital in ways that will add value to our network of customers and carriers and generate returns for our employees and shareholders. We will look to acquire quality companies that fit our strategies, business model and culture, and we will continue to reward our shareholders through buybacks and dividends.","Now onto the balance sheet on Slide seven, working capital decreased 9% versus the prior year, driven by lower gross revenues and the resulting decrease in accounts receivable. Our debt balance at the quarter was down modestly to $1.34 billion. Across our credit facility, private placement debt, AR securitization and senior notes, our weighted average interest rate was 4% in the quarter.","In the first quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard on leases. Starting with the first quarter of 2019, our future lease obligations and related right-to-use asset are now included on our balance sheet. This policy change will not have a material impact on our income statement.","On to Slide 8. I will wrap up my comments this morning with the look at our current trends. Our consistent practice is to share per business day comparisons of net revenues and truckload volume.","April 2019 Company net revenues per business day have increased approximately 5% and NAST truckload volumes have decreased approximately 4%. As a reminder, last year's net revenue per business day increased 15%, 14% and 23% in April, May and June, respectively.","We appreciate you listening this morning, and I will now turn over to Bob to provide additional context on our segment performance.","Bob Biesterfeld","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. I will begin my remarks on our operating segment performance by highlighting the current state of the North America truckload market .","On Slide 9, the light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in NAST truckload rate per mile billed to our customers and cost per mile paid to our contract carriers, net of fuel costs over the current decade. As a reminder, this Slide includes the impact of our truckload business previously reported in the Robinson Fresh segment.","NAST truckload price per mile and cost per mile both declined in the quarter versus the year ago period, where both price and cost increased over 20%. We benefited from a market-based shift to contractual volume in a falling cost environment, as routing guide performance returned to a more normal depth of tender, resulting in improved truckload net revenue margin in the first quarter. And while changes in cost tend to lead changes in price, over time price and cost generally move together.","One of the metrics we use to measure market conditions is the truckload routing guide depth from our Managed Services business, which represents roughly $4 billion in freight under management.","In the first quarter, average routing guide depth of tender was 1.2, representing that on average the first carrier in a shipper's routing guide was executing the shipment in most cases. As John mentioned, we are seeing evidence of a softening demand and modest increase in capacity, as reflected by the reduction in price and costs shown on this Slide.","We continue to set pricing that we feel best reflects the current freight market conditions, while maximizing our ability to drive net revenue growth. So with route guide depth moderating, we are adjusting our prices to reflect the current environment and to ensure we are near the top of our customer's routing guides.","Moving to Slide 10, this graph shows NAST truckload average price per mile billed to customers and cost per mile paid to our carriers, net of fuel, since 2010, and represents the underlying data from the previous Slide.","We have excluded the actual price per mile and cost per mile scale on this Slide to protect our proprietary information. While the absolute price per mile and cost per mile moderated versus last quarter and are below year-ago levels, they have returned to the trend line which averages about 4% annual increases in rate and cost over the current decade.","Our non-asset-based business model combined with the largest network of customers and carriers in North America, gives us the flexibility to adjust our pricing in response to changing marketplace conditions.","This chart highlights the strength of our business model over time and shows that we have maintained a consistent spread between price and cost, even in periods of high volatility in the freight market and periods of aggressive competitive activity.","Turning to Slide 11, in our North American Surface Transportation business, first quarter NAST net revenues increased 11% to $487 million, led by double-digit growth in truckload. Our first quarter results also included volume growth in both truckload and LTL service lines and growth in market share, when compared to year-over-year changes in the Cash Freight Index. A shift in our business mix toward contractual freight in a falling cost environment drove a 230 basis point expansion in first quarter NAST net revenue margin.","Truckload net revenues increased 14.7% to $359 million in the quarter, driven by the margin expansion we typically see as we transition to a more balanced freight market. Our shift toward contractual volume resulted in approximate mix of 65% contractual and 35% transactional volume in the quarter versus the 55%, 45% mix in the year ago period.","Our first quarter results include the impact of reprising activity to reflect current market conditions, including modest price declines in contractual awards with several of our customers. First quarter NAST truckload volumes increased 0.5% versus last year, and increased 2% on a per business day basis.","This volume growth includes the impact of approximately 60% reduction in our negative loads associated with contractual shipments. Profitable volume for NAST increased at a mid-single-digit rate for the quarter.","We continue to add new carriers to our network, driving further expansion of the largest fleet of motor carriers in North America. We added approximately 5,000 new carriers in the first quarter, a 19% increase over last year's first quarter. Carriers are increasingly relying on C.H. Robinson to provide freight that enables them to be successful business owners. This also allows us to provide our customers with additional capacity solutions that help them more effectively execute their supply chains.","First quarter LTL net revenues increased 3.6% to $115 million, led by growth in our consolidation and temperature controlled LTL businesses. Despite weather disruptions in the Midwest and one less business day, we were able to deliver 1% volume growth in the quarter. We expect our LTL volume growth to accelerate in the second quarter as we continue to add new customers and renew awards with existing customers.","In our intermodal service line, net revenues decreased 3.9% in the quarter. Intermodal volumes declined 33% as a combination of lane reductions related to precision scheduled railroading and a decline in truckload pricing drove an industry shift from intermodal to truckload. This decline in volume was largely offset by higher pricing and a change in customer mix for the quarter.","Slide 12 outlines our NAST operating income performance. First quarter operating income increased 17.6% to $211 million. Operating margin of 43.4% improved 240 basis points, driven by the combination of double-digit net revenue growth and a modest increase in headcount in the quarter.","This strong operating performance reflects the benefits of our continued investments in technology. Our investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning are providing expanded capabilities and insights to our customers and our carriers.","Our advanced algorithms and data advantage are further improving the ability for our employees to profitably match shipper demand and carrier supply and increasing the level of automated interactions across our network. These technology investments have helped us generate four consecutive quarters of year-over-year operating margin expansion in our NAST business.","Over the balance of 2019 and beyond we'll continue to accelerate our digital transformation efforts to provide benefits to our network of customers and carriers and to drive process efficiency for our employees. We expect that our NAST headcount will be flat to down slightly for the year.","Turning to Slide 13, and our Global Forwarding business, first quarter Global Forwarding net revenues increased 3.4% to $127 million. In our ocean service line, net revenues increased 4% for the quarter, mostly driven by margin expansion. Ocean volumes were flat in the quarter. First quarter air net revenues increased 0.4%, as margin expansion was largely offset by a 4% decline in shipments.","We believe that our first quarter volume performance in ocean and air was negatively impacted by increased shipments in the fourth quarter of 2018, as many of our customers worked to build inventory ahead of anticipated tariffs enacted in the first quarter of 2019. Customs net revenues increased 5.9% for the first quarter, driven by customs transaction growth of 2.5%, as we continue to expand our customs presence around the world.","Our first quarter also includes one month of results from our acquisition of The Space Cargo Group, a leading provider of international freight forwarding, customs brokerage and other logistics services in Spain and Colombia.","We have an extensive operating history with Space Cargo as our agent in Spain, and we feel great about the cultural compatibility and the talented team that we have brought on to Robinson. The integration is off to a great start. As the acquisition closed on February 28th, Space Cargo's results did not have a material impact on our overall Global Forwarding or Enterprise results for the quarter.","In our conversations with our global customers, these companies are continuing to plan for tariff activity and potential implications and the redesign of global supply chains. We are actively engaged with our Global Forwarding customers to help them understand and quantify the impacts of the changing tariff landscape.","We are benefiting from our strong presence in Southeast Asia, where first quarter net revenues grew well ahead of our total service line growth for both ocean and air. Given our broad portfolio of service offerings, we continue to believe that we are well positioned to help our customers win in an ever-changing global trade environment.","Slide 14 outlines our Global Forwarding operating income performance. First quarter operating income increased 72.8% to $14 million, operating margin of 11.2% increased 450 basis points versus last year, driven by higher net revenues and a 1.3% decline in average headcount. As a reminder, the first quarter is typically our smallest net revenue quarter for the year, so our first quarter operating margin is typically well below the average for the year.","We continue to see significant opportunities to drive scale and geographic reach in our Global Forwarding business. At the same time, we will increase our level of technology deployment to make our processes more efficient.","Moving forward, we expect to deliver operating margin expansion through a combination of volume growth that exceeds headcount growth and investments in technology to drive operating cost efficiency. Over the long-term, we remain confident that we will deliver operating margin performance, consistent with other leading companies in the global forwarding segment.","Moving to our All Other and Corporate businesses on Slide 15. As a reminder, All Other now includes Robinson Fresh, Managed Services, surface transportation outside of North America, other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses.","First quarter Robinson Fresh net revenues were $29 million, down 5% from last year. Case volumes declined 7%, primarily driven by weather related crop reductions. Managed Services' net revenues increased 10.9% to $20 million in the quarter, driven by a combination of selling additional services to existing customers and new customer wins.","Customers continue to value our transportation management system offering, which allows them to manage their carrier selection process in complex supply chains without the required fixed investment in people or technology.","We have got a strong pipeline of new business opportunities in our Managed Service business and we expect continued net revenue growth as we move through the year. Other Surface Transportation net revenues increased 0.7% in the quarter to $16 million, primarily driven by mid single-digit volume growth in European truckload.","During the first quarter, we were able to deliver market share gains in NAST truckload and LTL, double-digit net revenue growth on a per day basis and net revenue margin and operating margin expansion in excess of 200 basis points. We also generated over $250 million in cash flow from operations and increased our returns to shareholders.","These strong results reflect the continued ability of our employees to successfully navigate an ever-changing marketplace where both market dynamics in the competitive landscape continues to evolve at a rapid pace.","Our people are focused on creating unique value for our network of customers and carriers and keeping them at the center of our focus. Because of this focus on accelerating commerce for the companies that engage on our platform, we continue to win in the marketplace. To ensure we deliver continued strong financial performance moving forward, we remain committed to three core objectives.","First, we are committed to taking market share. Over time, we have taken market share in each of our largest service lines and we expect to continue to expand our market share gains in 2019 and beyond.","Second, we'll continue to automate our core processes and reduce our cost to sell and cost to serve, while also providing excellent service to our customers and our carriers. And third we are intently focused on improving operating leverage across our businesses.","We remain committed to the long-term targets we shared at our Investor Day in 2017. Over time, we expect to deliver annual net revenue growth of 5% to 10%, with operating income growth that exceeds net revenue growth.","We are firmly committed to operating margin expansion and believe our continued investments in technology and process automation will help us to achieve this objective. We are also committed to strong cash returns to shareholders and expect to deliver annual double-digit growth in earnings per share over time.","Moving forward, I'm confident that we'll continue to deliver industry-leading capabilities and solutions to the over 200,000 companies that conduct business on our global platform. I'm also confident that we'll continue to provide rewarding career opportunities for our employees and generate strong returns for our shareholders.","Thanks for listening this morning. Before I turn the call back to John, for the last time, I wanted to take a moment in this forum and thank John for his leadership of this great organization over the past 17 years. Under John's leadership, C.H Robinson has evolved from a leading US truck brokerage and produce Company to a global supply chain Company, powered by people, process and technology.","Together under John's leadership, our team has created tremendous value for our customers, our carriers and our shareholders, while providing opportunities for all of our employees around the globe to learn, to grow and to serve.","On behalf of all the 15,000 people around the globe, I want to say, thanks for all you have done John. I'm honored and excited to lead Robinson into the next chapter with your support as Executive Chairman and to build upon our strong foundation of success.","And with that, I will turn it back to John.","John Wiehoff","Thank you, Bob. I will wrap up our prepared remarks with a few final comments. Our core go-to-market strategy has always been to help our network of customers and carriers understand and adapt to the cyclical nature of the freight market.","We remain focused on working closely with our customers to help them understand the market, to ensure we can both meet our customer commitments and achieve pricing reflective of the marketplace conditions. We will continue to invest in our people, processes and technology to increase the value of the supply chain solutions we deliver to our global legal system of over 200,000 companies .","We will also leveraged our digital transformation to provide our customers, carrier partners, and our people with an expanding set of insights and capabilities, and we will remain focused on operating cost efficiency, driving higher levels of service execution for our employees and increasing returns to our shareholders.","Our team and our platform are the competitive advantages that will allow us to win in the marketplace and they continue to get stronger. We have a great future ahead of us and I'm highly confident in our ability to continue to create value for all of our stakeholders.","As Bob referenced, in February of 2019, I announced my intention to retire as Chief Executive Officer of C.H. Robinson. As part of a long-planned succession process, we also announced that Bob Biesterfeld will become the next Chief Executive Officer of our Company. I will remain on the Board of Directors as Chairman. Both moves are effective next week on May 9th.","During his almost two decades as C.H. Robinson, Bob has consistently demonstrated deep industry knowledge, strategic vision and a passion for delivering results. He has been the driving force behind our digital transformation efforts, accelerating the pace of innovation and technology deployment across our organization. Bob's an exceptional leader, who is committed to C.H. Robinson's culture and core values and I'm highly confident in his ability to extend the C.H. Robinson's long track record of success.","As I reflect on my 17-year tenure as Chief Executive Officer of Robinson, I'm very proud of what we have accomplished. We have aggressively expanded our service offerings and network to become a comprehensive global third-party logistics Company.","Over this period, we have increased our total revenues fivefold and returned over $6 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. But overall, I'm most proud of the winning culture we have created in the over 15,000 employees who continue to drive our success today.","To all our customers, contract carriers and suppliers, thank you for your business and for trusting us to help accelerate your global commerce, to our shareholders, thank you for your investment in C.H. Robinson, and to our employees around the world, thank you for the hard work you demonstrate every day and congratulations on your achievements.","I take immense pride in our results over the last 17 years. And I'm very excited to see the next chapter of growth at C.H. Robinson. I remain as confident as ever that we have the right people, the right processes and the right technology to continue to win in the marketplace.","That concludes our prepared comments. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator, so that we can answer the submitted questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Mr. Houghton, the floor is yours for the question and answer session.","Bob Houghton","Thank you. Donna. First, I would like to thank the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions after our earnings release yesterday. For today's Q&A session, I will frame-up the question and then turn it over to John, Bob or Scott for a response.","Similar to earnings calls over the previous years, we have received both secular and cyclical questions regarding our business performance. This morning, we will begin with a few secular questions and then transition to topics that are more cyclical in nature.","Our first question comes from several analysts, Bob, regarding the recent announcement by Amazon to enter the truck brokerage space, how does this impact your business in the short term? And longer term, how might the Company react to a competitor willing to do business for no profit?","Bob Biesterfeld","Thanks, Bob. So good morning again everybody, I guess to start, I haven't actually seen any announcement directly from Amazon that they are doing anything new. There was an industry trade publication that stated this as something new last week, but we have actually assumed or known Amazon to be in the space for quite some time, as they work to optimize their internal network. So I would look at this as another step in what is been a rapid change in the competitive landscape over the last several years.","To the question around competitors being willing to do business for no profit, since we have been public, we have never really seen that play out as a value creating approach and it's certainly not going to be our approach in this market. If I look back over the past 20 years of my tenure here at Robinson, we have really seen several instances of disruption in our competitive landscape.","And really with each instance of disruption in our history, the bare case on Robinson has always been that these new entrants, who are going to disintermediate our model and drive margins down or to zero. And so through each of these phases we have stayed true to one of our core values, which is evolving constantly and managing our business for long-term value creation.","But in the early 2000s, it was the advent of the Internet. The arrival of the load board that was going to bring price and cost transparency and disintermediate brokerage. In the mid 2000s, we had upstart 3PLs actively pricing freight below market rates in order to take share with large shippers, either in order to sell or to go public.","We have seen roll-up strategies launched, fueled by a near zero cost of capital targeted directly at disintermediating Robinson. And recently, we have got numerous of these tech start or tech first brokerages promising low or no margins, reducing friction and improving efficiency. And these have really been high on the hype curve as we have seen, again fueled by what seems to be an endless source of private equity.","But through this whole long range cycle what Robinson has done is maintain our margins relatively consistent. We have increased our share of the market. We have diversified our business and we have increased our return to shareholders.","So it's not to say that we are ignoring competition or the evolving competitive focus, we have actually got tremendous respect for the competitors that have come into this marketplace and the incredible levels of talent that are entering our industry today.","We think that this infusion of talent, and new ways of doing business has really been a positive catalyst for us and for the entire industry. We are just not really conceding at this point that the success that some of these competitors have had across other industries is immediately transferable and assurance of success in our industry.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. The next question is for John from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley, Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company, asked a similar question, John, how would you characterize the competitive environment in the space, both among incumbents and with new entrants? Are you running into tech focused brokers more and if so, are they being more aggressive on price than traditional brokers?","John Wiehoff","So, I will build a little bit on Bob's comments and maybe just by backing up and reminding everybody that from an overall standpoint, when we look at the competitive landscape and how we monitor our position in it and what we are doing across our various segments and geographies, we do have a very diverse list of competitors.","In our European business, in our Managed Service business in our fresh business, there is a completely different set of competitors. When you get within North America Surface Trans, even within the different services, the LTL world and a lot of the various services, have different competitors.","When you get down to our largest source of revenues, the North American truckload business, there still is somewhere around 20,000 licensed brokers and over 100,000 carriers out there. So when you get into that core source of revenue for us that most of our shareholders, analysts are focused on, it's a very fragmented, highly competitive landscape that we have been a part of for the last several decades.","There is also a fair amount of churn within that competitive landscape. In good times and in bad, we see thousands of new entrants and thousands of people leaving in relatively short periods of time.","Bob mentioned that throughout the decades, we have seen a variety of ways that people have entered into this space, including relationships, including programs to buy market share, if you will, or come in and being much more price-competitive. If you think about how this broad fragmented marketplace evolves, there is a variety of ways that you can join and try to be competitive.","Many of the large asset-based carriers who have gotten into the brokerage business over the year, start by leveraging their available capacity and their dense lanes to try to market that capacity in broader, more direct brokerage ways.","You see shippers who try to leverage some of their high spend areas to get more involved in optimization with other shippers and try to manage. That typically in a start-up mode, in a pure start-up, price or relationship, are the two things that you would try to leverage to compete.","Bob commented on more tech start-ups and over the last four, five years, especially with the explosion of digital capabilities, there are more start-ups, we are seeing more start-ups in tech focused sales mode.","And I would say that some of the themes around there are the desire to get the scale faster because we all acknowledge, some of the benefits of scale in a digital world, and also maybe creating a different experience with digital connectivity with some of the carriers or some of the information that might be available back and forth. So, we do see a change in those competitive landscape in terms of some of the start-up capital and some of the technology focus of some of the start-ups.","But if you really step back from it, overall, it remains a very large fragmented, high churning industry that those of us who are investing in the digital platforms and really trying to take it to a new level of performance and scale are making some serious changes in our models to go with that. But overall, it remains somewhat similar in terms of it being a broad, fragmented, competitive landscape that we continue to monitor.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, John. The next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens, Todd Fowler of KeyBanc and Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer, ask similar questions. Bob, the adoption of technology in the brokerage market seems to have been accelerated with additional options for digital freight matching now available on the market. For C.H Robinson, where do you guys stand in terms of offering a digital solution for customers? What percentage of your loads is booked through a digital platform and what is your goal for this metric over the next few years?","Bob Biesterfeld","There is no doubt that technology has been more broadly accepted in the marketplace. And I think the greatest shift in adoption that we have seen more recently is from the small carrier community, which is really great for us as the small carriers are starting to see the use of technology be a win for them versus a burden.","And so, as we and others become more tech enabled and provide value creating offerings for carriers via mobile or the web, we are seeing those small carriers really gravitate toward that, both here in North America as well as in Europe and other parts of the world where we do business.","Our digital focus on customers has really been about meeting customers how and where they want to engage with us and we are really proud of Navisphere, but we are also somewhat platform agnostic when it comes to customer engagement and connectivity. Our real focus is on automating that customer journey and ensuring that it is frictionless as possible.","As, I think, you all know, we have greatly increased our investment in technology in this space. We have spent about $1 billion on tech over the last decade and we would expect that we are going to spend about $1 billion on tech over the next four to five years. And so, we are accelerating the pace in which we develop this digital platform for our customers.","In terms of the direct question of kind of where we are at in that journey? Today, about 75% of our load tenders are automated with our customers, so you could say that about 75% of our shipments are fully digital on the front end. About 50% of the shipments that run through our system are fully automated from end to end.","And then, John mentioned the scale in this digital era, that's really driving for us about 650 million digital imprints every year which are data points that we can use to further tune our algorithms, to drive matching algorithms, to understand supply chain disruption in new and important ways.","As I mentioned that meeting our customers' how and where they want to buy, we have really created unique value streams for our smaller customers through our freight quote Navisphere platforms, for those infrequent shippers that just want to come in online and get pricing for LTL or truckload, book a shipment and swipe a credit card and have a fully automated experience, that lives today for many of our infrequent shippers.","And for our larger shippers, we have got that fully automated end to end process, real-time visibility of inventory in motion and at rest, and some of the largest companies in the world are using Robinson for that digital supply chain experience.","On the carrier side, we are continuing to evolve and advance in the process of digital freight matching and digital booking. We are seeing a nice uptick there from carriers coming into Navisphere, and whether it be transactionally booking loads, self booking loads or in the dedicated space of doing tours and multi-stop earnings.","So across all of our portfolio, we are seeing improvements in this automated and digital booking. We are really happy with where we are today, but we are going to continue to invest and drive forward.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. We will now transition to topics that are more cyclical in nature. The next question is for John from Dave Vernon of Bernstein. Are the volume declines seen in April in the contract brokerage business or the spot business? How is mix shifting?","John Wiehoff","Maybe expanding a little bit, we have consistently shared kind of a current month's data points around what we are seeing in terms of overall net revenue growth and volume activity and we shared those for April with net revenue being up 5%, and North America truckload volume being down 4%.","The shift in the business, I will refer you back to Slide 9, where we have laid out the last decade in terms of the cyclicality of our truckload business and how we are seeing price and activity changes across the market.","No question that we have seen a decline in spot market activity. That is where the volume changes are coming from. Over the last year and a half, we have talked and executed our changes through the pricing dynamics of our committed freight. If you go back to that Slide nine and look at that unprecedented run-up of pricing, during that period of time the spot market activity becomes a much bigger component of the mix.","And you see over the last couple of quarters now the kind of steady decline of demand and pricing, where the market will become much more committed. We have shared our route guide metrics that freight will execute along those route guides in a much more compliant way and then the declines that we see now come in the spot market era.","Our truck business really through April is functioning and our net revenue growth is fairly similar to the first quarter. We are shedding some volume and we are reoptimizing for a net revenue growth.","Our April change really versus the first quarter has more to do with drop-off in growth in some of the other services that we think is part of just being early in April and being a little bit choppy. So it's always a little bit risky like we say to share that mid-month activity.","We have Easter comparisons and other things that can make a difference as well, but the overall market environment, I think, the highlights that we shared earlier are that demand is softening, we are seeing high route guide compliance and high execution around committed freight levels and a decline in the spot market due to the price changes.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, John. The next question is from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Bob, why are volumes continuing to decline, is this part of the long-term strategy to prioritize pricing over volume growth?","Bob Biesterfeld","Thanks, Bob. So the short answer on that is that, at least, for the quarter volumes didn't decline, right. On a per business day basis truckload volumes were up 2% in first quarter and profitable volume growth when you consider - eliminating some of the negative loads, was in the mid single-digit.","So I think I have been clear in a lot of different forms about our key areas of focus, around taking share through volume growth, decoupling headcount growth from revenue and volume over time and improving our operating margin.","I think the key words there are over time, and so any 30-day period may not represent that result, which is why we don't measure our business in 30-day periods or that short term. If we think about April, and John mentioned it, we had a little bit of a comparison due to Easter, we had a softer-than-expected market.","But profitable volume growth is going to be a key component to NAST's success in 2019, as well as in our other services. So we look back our historical volume growth over the past number of years has been about 4% on average and that's really the range that we would expect volume to be in the second half of the year.","And so, to answer the question directly, our long-term strategy is not to trade price for volume. We are volume-oriented and volume focused.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer and Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan, also asked similar questions. Bob, net operating margins expanded 250 basis points versus last year in the first quarter. Can you talk about the opportunity for further operating margin expansion as the year progresses? And do you see opportunities to optimize the operating expense structure?","Bob Biesterfeld","Sure. So net operating margins in the second, third and fourth quarter of last year were 32.6%, 35.4%, 35.8% sequentially compared to 33.1% in Q1 of this year. So across each of our business units, if you talk to any one of the Divisional Presidents they would tell you that they have an extreme focus on expanding their operating margins.","And that's going to come through, again, growing our market share and associated net revenues, against modest headcount growth. In our largest segments of NAST and Global Forwarding, we are expecting headcount to be flat to down for the year as we implement further technology enabled productivity initiatives, against planned increases in revenue and additional wins in our core services.","The offset to that is that we are continuing to add heads ahead of growth in Managed Services, we have talked about our technology investment that's going to come with additional heads in IT, development, engineering and data science.","So our investments in technology at the core are really focused in three core areas: it's our customers; it's our carriers; and it's in our employees and our workflow. And much of that technology investment is what is going to drive greater efficiency internally as we refine business processes, eliminate redundancy and non-value added steps within our workflow.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. The next question is for John from Jack Atkins of Stephens. Chris Wetherbee also asked a similar question. Please talk about trends in global forwarding? What did you see in the ocean and air markets during the first quarter, and how are you thinking about the performance of the forwarding business for the balance of the year?","John Wiehoff","So the big picture on Global Forwarding at Robinson, as you all know, six or seven years ago when we doubled down and made our largest acquisition of Phoenix, since then we have been continuing to invest in the division with follow on acquisitions, and did that again this quarter with Space Cargo.","And overall, feel very positive and some really strong momentum around our pipeline and our capabilities as we continue to build out our global network and gain more and more confidence in the competitiveness of our Global Forwarding all around the world.","We did see, as we mentioned in our prepared comments, some potential tariff pull forward. It's really hard to quantify that because shippers are all making a lot of subjective decisions. And I did mention earlier that we see some chop in the first part of April around our ocean activity, that we think will normalize as the year goes on.","So, little bit of a bumpy start in 2019 in terms of some of the Global Forwarding volumes and activities, but overall, our expectations for the year, and more importantly, the long-term going forward are that we feel great about our offering, our network, our competitiveness and the things that we are doing to continue to take market share and grow Global Forwarding as a more and more relevant part of the C.H. Robinson network.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, John. The next question also comes from Jack Atkins. Dave Vernon of Bernstein and Fadi Chamoun of BMO, also asked similar questions. John, now that we are in the heart of bid season, how have you seen contractual pricing trend on average this year compared to 2018? Have you noticed anything different about bid season this year compared to prior bid cycles, given the current freight market backdrop?","John Wiehoff","I would say, nothing too significant. Referring back again to a chart that I think is most helpful on the cyclicality in the year-to-year, that Slide nine that's in our prepared deck that shows the significant ramp up and the significant ramp down. If you really go back the last 20 or 30 years, we have used the term unprecedented, that there hasn't been that kind of 20% price increase year-over-year.","And then, the sort of decline that we have seen over the last four or five quarters. So because of that, I would say, if there is anything different that in bid processes there certainly is a fair amount of questioning and concern as to where prices are going and where the bottom is and kind of what the market will look like.","We have shared a number of times that it still remains true that over a decade or so these price and cost increases have averaged in the 3% to 4% range and that when you look at it over a longer period of time the cost changes are fairly rational.","But in a short period of time, we are seeing an increase in volatility, which probably has something to do with digitalization and the rule changes around ELDs a year ago, that probably put some preventative pricing in place and maybe there is some improvement around that.","So the process for bids has gone very similar in terms of high volumes of participation, very competitive, very fragmented, again, processes remained fairly similar and probably just a heightened level of dialog around where prices are headed and how are we going to come out of this greater volatility of price increases and declines over the last couple of years.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, John. The next question is for Bob from Matt Young with Morningstar. NAST gross profit margin percentage increased a meaningful amount on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Should we expect truckload margins to normalize as the year progresses and perhaps sell rate declines to begin to catch up to the recent fall in rates paid to carriers?","Bob Biesterfeld","So, I would go back again the Slide nine in our deck that shows that change in rate and cost over time. And what you see there is that cost is always the leading indicator to price, right, cost leads price. And then, if you take that a step further, the transactional market for price typically leads the contractual market and it will pull it either up or down.","The gross margin expanded in Q1 as decrease in price lagged that decrease in cost. If we look at the market indicators it would say that likely the contractual markets would be pulled down by the decreasing or the declines in the spot market.","In the past decade, we have seen the change in rate and cost move up about 4% a year on average. Given the markets that we are in, I would expect that the market is going to somewhat fall back to that trend line. It's never linear, but as we think about the Slide nine, I think it would be realistic to expect we are going to get back to that average.","Looking at Slide 10, you can see that our spread has been relatively consistent over time, and we still include the gross revenue margin in the appendix in Slide 19, which shows that really they are pretty tightly bound over the last decade.","We tend to manage the business, as we have said before, to net revenue dollars per load versus net revenue margin, and we have certainly seen that to be on the high side of average over the course of the first four months of 2019.","And we'd expect that as we go through bid season and reprice, that that's going to come back to a more normal range, which is why frankly volume is such an important part of the second half of the year for us.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. The next question is for Scott and comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Personnel expense growth decelerated to the lowest level since 2016. Can you talk about the outlook for growth of this expense category in 2019, and what are your expectations for headcount relative to net revenue growth or volume?","Scott Hagen","Sure. We expect NAST headcount to be flat to down for the year, with a forecast of positive volume growth for the year. Global Forwarding is also expected to be flat to down for the year based on productivity initiatives within that business. Robinson Fresh will likely be down year-over-year basis, with the work done to improve their operating margins.","The other business units, IT, and other shared services will likely increase for the year. So, overall, I would expect headcount to be flat to plus or minus 1% for the entire year. The variable components of compensation will be determined on the performance of the business units and the overall enterprise.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Scott. The next question comes from Todd Fowler with Keybanc. Bob, how do you think about acquisitions in the current environment? Please provide an update as to what service lines or geographies are attractive? And would C.H. Robinson consider something on the final mile side or more specific to e-Commerce outside of line haul?","Bob Biesterfeld","So we really like our current approach to M&A. And I mean hopefully it's been a theme that starts to develop here over the course of the last six or seven years or beyond that we really like founder-led businesses that are really healthy, that are a cultural fit, that are profitable, that fit nicely and complement our existing foundational services.","We are going to continue to look in the Global Forwarding space as we have for deals that fill in a geographical space for us, with strength and scale or expand our services. Across the entire portfolio, we are looking for really those same characteristics.","In terms of the question around final mile and e-Commerce, we are certainly exploring that space. Valuations are extremely high in that space. We really want to be mindful of the short and long-term impact of doing deals in that area, but we are certainly active in looking.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. Todd Fowler of KeyBanc and Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan asked about market share. Bob, please expand on the outlook comments around increasing market share in 2019 and beyond? Is this primarily North American truckload share and measured by volume growth or is this referencing another segment with a different metric for measurement?","Bob Biesterfeld","So, I think part of what excites me about being at Robinson today is, while we are the largest in a number of our services, whether that be LTL or truckload or ocean and transpacific eastbound, we are no more than 3% of the overall market in any one of those spaces. So, we have got tremendous upside for growth regardless of the cycle that we are in.","Volume growth and taking share is really important to us across each of our modes and services. But as you know, truckload, LTL, and ocean are really the needle movers for us organizationally and we are certainly focused and taking share in that space, whether it be through new bids, RFPs or growth within existing customers.","The other thing that we talk about internally at a macro level is that, in this digital era, the concept of freight under management is a really important metric for us to look at. So Jordan certainly looks at freight under management specific to the Managed Services business. We also look at that across the overall enterprise, because of the value that we are able to gain from the data that we can collect across the global supply chain.","And it gives us really an advantage to again address the algorithms and the work that we are doing, so that we can take that data advantage that we accumulate and turn it around and use that to help our customers to solve their most complex supply chain issues.","At a more micro-grain, as we think about our account managers and our account teams, they are thinking about share of wallet or addressable market within each one of their customers. So they are actively measuring what that opportunity is at a customer level and working to cross sell all of our core and emerging services into those customers and measuring their share of wallet or their market share growth with the customers that they serve.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. The next question is for Scott from Dave Vernon of Bernstein. How should we be thinking about net revenue growth for this fiscal year, should we be bracing for a slower second half?","Bob Biesterfeld","Well, its, obviously, difficult to predict the future and we do not provide guidance. Our overall comparisons do become more challenging in the second half of the year and we believe volume growth across all of our services will be key to growth in the second half of the year for us.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Scott. The next question for John is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please compare your viewpoint of this year's freight brokerage conditions relative to other years of this current cycle?","John Wiehoff","I talked earlier about the unique pricing environment and the changes that we have seen over the last couple of years that kind of may make things different. Maybe a few other data points to touch on that, overall, while demand is softening and declining, we would echo the fact that most of the customer reviews that we have been a part of - we are seeing customers that have a fairly positive outlook and do continue to see normal levels of freight activity.","Maybe some of the capacity additions, as well as some of the maturity of the ELD implementations and pricing strategies from a year ago, all that's contributing to a more balanced, or more normalized environment currently.","Maybe the other thing that bears mentioning, when you think about sort of the overall freight and brokerage environment is that, as we swing back and forth between secular and cyclical topics is that, there is probably never been greater receptivity to the business model and our presence in the marketplace.","Our teams are seeing tremendous amounts of opportunities and bids to participate in, our outsourced solutions and integrated offerings are as popular as ever and growing. When you think about some of the competitive threats in the secular changes, it's always good to remember the positive side of that, that the addressable market for third-party logistics and some of the things that we are doing is as big as ever, and it has as much momentum as ever.","So, while there are uniqueness\u2019s around volatility, and pricing and some of the regulatory changes, maybe the biggest call out is that we continue to see an ever expanding universe of opportunities around the types of services that we are providing and the types of opportunities that they would apply to in the marketplace.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, John. The next question is for Bob from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Scott Schneeberger asked a similar question. Could you please provide comments on truck brokerage capacity trends and drivers and provide an updated view point of ELD impacts now that the regulation has been in place for over a year?","Bob Biesterfeld","Sure. So, we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we had about 5,000 new carriers join network in the first quarter which is about a 20% increase during the quarter. And if it does seem like the industry has added incremental capacity as well, and it's coming mostly in that small carrier space. In terms of the impact of ELDs kind of a year or so post implementation of ELDs.","I think I would describe the environment that I think the bad actors have adjusted and by that, I mean, drivers have accepted the electronic logging devices, particular shippers or lanes that were problematic for the use of ELDs have adjusted their behavior or their expectations as well.","And so, in general, it feels as though the market has kind of come back to an equilibrium. They've learned how to work within the new constraints of the electronic logging devices. And it's really not a topic of conversation when we talk to carriers or shippers today to any great lengths.","I think, again, if anything, the data and location services associated with ELDs are giving us real opportunities to think differently about matching and data aggregation and location services and providing more real-time information to shippers, as well as communicating with carriers. So in general, we have seen the positive impact to the overall business.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Scott. The next question is for John from Scott Schneeberger on tariffs. Please share your view of the recent U.S. China tariff dynamic and its influence on C.H Robinson's Global Forwarding business?","John Wiehoff","The tariffs are driving probably three specific things, one is really an elevated focus on compliance. So these tariffs have to be calculated and applied properly and to the right things and our team has been very busy working with our customers to make sure that all the tariffs are properly applied and that compliance is in place. I mentioned earlier, the potential acceleration to get some product shipped before those tariffs would apply. So that's been an impact as well.","And probably the third leg is just really the longer-term supply chain consultation and planning around will the tariff stick and what long-term impact, will they have on sourcing patterns and shipping patterns for the customers that we are working with. We don't believe at this point that there is been a lot of impact to our volumes, or freight forwarding business based on those long-term redesigns.","I think most people are holding their breath and waiting for resolution of what those tariffs might look like on a more permanent basis, but there certainly our discussions and planning exercises going on to what if scenario and think about what the future may look like from a supply chain design standpoint, which could have a very material effect on freight flows and kind of where things move to.","We are working to make sure that wherever sourcing origins and international freight moves to that we have capabilities there and that we can evolve with our customers through these issues and challenges, but I would say, those are probably the three main impacts that tariffs have had on our Global Forwarding business to-date.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, John. And our last question is for Bob from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Chris Wetherbee asked a similar question. Can you provide an update on your CFO search?","Bob Biesterfeld","Sure. So briefly on that, as expected, we have engaged a search firm in that space. I think we have shared that before. I would describe our process as in the early innings. I feel great about our finance team today, extremely strong leadership and talent going across the entire organization, they are doing really good things. And Scott's doing a great job in the interim.","We are evaluating a really diverse slate of talented candidates across multiple industries today, both internally and externally that we think would each bring unique strengths to the next -- to the role of CFO at C.H Robinson.","As you guys know, we have got aggressive growth plans and we are going to continue to accelerate the pace of change. So I'm looking for the right leader to partner with me and the rest of the senior leadership team that can help us to do that most effectively.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. That concludes the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. A replay of today's call will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website at chobinson.com at approximately 11:30 AM, Eastern Time today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached by phone or email. Thank you again for participating in our first quarter 2019 conference call. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."],"4424":["C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Robert Houghton - Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury","Robert Biesterfeld - Chief Executive Officer","Mike Zechmeister - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today\u2019s presentation, Bob Houghton will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, October 30, 2019.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Bob Houghton, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Robert Houghton","Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. On our call today will be Bob Biesterfeld, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Zechmeister, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike joined us in September and brings with him three decades of public company finance experience. Prior to joining Robinson, he most recently served as CFO of United Natural Foods. He also spent 25 years at General Mills, where he held a variety of finance leadership roles, including VP of Finance for the Pillsbury division, VP of Finance for U.S. Retail Sales and Treasurer.","Bob and Mike will provide commentary on our 2019 third quarter results. Presentation slides that accompany the remarks can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com. We will follow that with responses to the pre-submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday.","I\u2019d like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today\u2019s presentation list factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management\u2019s expectations.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Biesterfeld","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter provided challenges in both our North American Surface Transportation segment as well as our Global Forwarding operating segment. Our net revenues, our operating incomes and our EPS results finished below our long-term expectations.","We anticipated an aggressive industry pricing environment coming into the second half of the year, driven by excess capacity and softening demand. And we knew that we faced difficult comparisons versus our strong double-digit net revenue growth in the second half of last year.","Our results were negatively impacted by truckload margin compression in North America, as the rate of change in pricing fell faster than that of costs for the first time in 6 quarters. While our contractual truckload volume did increase at low-single-digit rates in the quarter, we did not generate the level of contractual volume growth that we anticipated.","And our growth in contractual volume was not enough to offset the significant declines in the spot market volume in the current environment, resulting in a 4% decline in truckload volume for the quarter. In Global Forwarding, we believe that shippers have largely worked through their elevated inventory levels. However, the global forwarding market continues to experience air and ocean volume declines as tariff concerns and fears of recession are softening demand.","A part of our customer value proposition, particularly in our committed relationships is helping our customers manage through freight cycles and the pricing volatility that occurs as a result of the cyclicality of our industry. Our people did a great job, controlling what we can control, which includes increasing awards in contractual bids with our largest customers in the quarter and continuing to provide excellent service and innovation.","As a result of this market, we are continuing to adjust our pricing strategies in order to optimize our results. The results that we delivered to our shareholders in the third quarter are below our long-term growth targets. But I\u2019m proud of the results that we delivered for our customers and our carriers; which is ultimately what will drive shareholder value creation over the long term.","Our teams across the globe worked hard, and as such, our contractual awards increased. And we were recognized by several customers during the quarter as their provider of the year. We also launched new products such as our Freightquote by C.H. Robinson for small businesses. And carriers continue to choose C.H. Robinson as the 3PL of choice for securing freight and optimizing their networks.","While the addition of thousands of new motor carriers every quarter allows us to bring new capacity solutions to life for our customer. Our long-term plans around transformation of our business are on track and our investments in technology and process improvements are paying dues.","During third quarter, we also returned $136 million to our shareholders and delivered industry-leading operating margins. Our financial results this quarter demonstrate that we\u2019re not immune to large cyclical swings in the freight environment. We believe that our continued investments through these down-cycles will drive better alignment between our net revenue growth and our costs and will enable us to generate operating margin expansion through this cycle and over the long term.","With those introductory comments, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike now to review our financial statements. As Bob Houghton mentioned in his intro, Mike comes to Robinson as a seasoned and strategic public-company CFO. He brings tremendous finance experience and is a proven leader that drives growth through strong leadership and effective business partnership.","Mike has been with us for almost two months now and we\u2019re very proud to have them on the team at Robinson. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike.","Mike Zechmeister","Thanks, Bob. I appreciate the kind words and couldn\u2019t be more excited to be a part of the Robinson team. Living in Minneapolis most of my life, I\u2019ve known Robinson as a terrific company with a great culture and a strong track record of success in the industry. While Q3 finished below our long-term expectations, I\u2019m energized by our strategy, the engagement of our team and the opportunities ahead.","Now, on to Slide 4 and our financial results for the quarter. Our third quarter total gross revenues decreased 10.2%, driven primarily by lower pricing across most transportation services due to the softening demand and excess capacity that Bob mentioned earlier.","Total company net revenues decreased 8.7% in the quarter, led by margin compression in our truckload service line. Q3 monthly net revenues per business day were down 10% in July, down 4% in August and down 16% in September compared to the same periods last year.","Total operating income was down 18.2% over last year. Operating margin declined 370 basis points versus last year, as personnel and SG&A declines in Q3 did not keep up with the net revenue decline, partially due to the increased spending in technology.","Diluted earnings per share was $1.07 in Q3, down 14.4% from $1.25 per fully diluted share in Q3 last year. Slide 5 covers other highlights impacting net income. Third quarter effective tax rate was 21.8%, an improvement of approximately 470 basis points from the 26.5% rate in Q3 last year. The lower effective tax rate was due primarily to a favorable adjustment to a prior year tax provision related to foreign derived intangible income and resulted in an approximately $2.7 million reduction in taxes in Q3.","We now expect our 2019 full-year effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%, down 1 percentage point from our previous guidance. During the third quarter, we recognized $5.8 million gain on the sale of our previously occupied Chicago Central Office Building in Chicago, Illinois.","This shows up as a benefit to the SG&A line on the income statement under the All Other and Corporate segment. Third quarter interest and other expense totaled $13.2 million, up from $6.5 million in Q3 last year. Interest and other expense includes the impact of currency revaluation, primarily related to the conversion of working capital and cash balances to the functional currency in each country where those investments reside.","Q3 this year included $1.1 million unfavorable impact from currency revaluation, compared to Q3 last year that included $6.7 million gain from currency revaluation.","Q3 interest expense declined $1.1 million, driven primarily by overall debt reduction. Average diluted shares outstanding was down 1.9% due primarily to $67 million in share repurchases in Q3.","Turning to Slide 6, cash flow from operations totaled $167 million in the third quarter, a 24.1% decline versus Q3 last year, due primarily to decreased earnings and partially offset by improved working capital.","Q3 capital expenditures totaled $19.4 million, which brings our year to date capital expenditures to $50.9 million. We now expect 2019 full year capital expenditures to be between $65 million and $75 million, with increased spending versus last year, primarily dedicated to technology. We remain on track to invest approximately $200 million in total technology spending in 2019.","In Q3, we returned approximately $136 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, which represents 9.9% decrease versus Q3 last year. Moving forward, we will continue to evaluate how to best deploy capital to optimize long-term value for our shareholders.","Now, on to some balance sheet highlights on Slide 7. Third quarter working capital decreased 9.6% versus the prior year, generally consistent with the declines in gross revenue and purchased transportation costs in the quarter.","Our debt balance at quarter end was $1.25 billion, down approximately $88 million versus the end of Q3 last year. And our weighted average interest rate was 4.1% in the quarter compared to 4.0% in Q3 last year.","I will wrap up my comments with a look out our current trends. While our October truckload volume trends have improved modestly over Q3 levels, the combination of soft demand and excess capacity is keeping, pricing well below year-ago levels. October, total company net revenues per business day is down approximately 15% and NAST truckload volume is approximately flat versus October last year. For reference, in 2018, total company net revenues per day increased 10% in October, increased 11% in November, and increased 13% in December.","Thanks for listening this morning, and I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bob to provide some additional context on the business and our segment performance.","Robert Biesterfeld","Thanks, Mike. I\u2019ll begin my remarks on our operating segment performance by highlighting the current state of the North American truckload market. On Slide 9, the light and dark blue lines represent the percentage change in NAST truckload rate per million billed to our customers and cost per mile paid to our contract carriers net of fuel cost over the current decade. We continue to see competitive levels of pricing activity in the market, including double-digit declines in both the spot market and contractual pricing versus year-ago pricing, where the industry experienced all-time highs.","Price per mile billed to our customers declined 12.5%, while cost per mile paid to our contract carriers net of fuel costs declined 12%. The rate of cost declined moderated versus that of the second quarter resulting in modest truckload net revenue margin compression in the third quarter. Our third quarter results reflect a shift to contractual volume that is typical for us in a declining price and cost environment, resulting in an approximate mix of 70% contractual and 30% transactional volume in the quarter versus a 60-40 mix in the year-ago period.","As we said before, one of the metrics we use to measure market conditions is the truckload routing guide depth from our Managed Services business, which represents roughly $4 billion in freight under management. Average routing guide depth of tender was 1.2 for the third quarter, representing that on average, the first carrier in a shipper\u2019s routing guide was executing the shipment in most cases. This route guide depth remains near the lowest levels we\u2019ve experienced this decade.","And contractual routing guides are largely operating with first tender acceptance rates in the high-90% range. Our pricing strategies with the NAST continue to reflect current conditions and work to ensure that we\u2019re near the top of the routing guide.","Turning to Slide 10 in our North American Surface Transportation business. Third quarter NAST net revenues decreased 13.2% driven primarily by the decline in truckload. Our third quarter combined truckload and LTL volumes outpaced year-over-year changes in the Cass Freight Index for the third consecutive quarter. Truckload net revenues decreased 17.4% in the quarter, driven by margin compression and lower volumes. Third quarter NAST truckload volume decreased 4% versus last year. Our third quarter truckload contractual volume increased at a low-single-digit pace.","Consistent with market trends, our spot market volumes declined at a double-digit rate driving the overall volume decline. During the quarter, we added roughly 4,400 new truckload carriers to our network. This was a 12% decrease over last year\u2019s third quarter when we added a record of 5,000 new truckload carriers, and it\u2019s down 8% sequentially compared to the second quarter of this year.","LTL net revenues increased 1.3%, led by growth in our temperature controlled business. LTL volume growth increased 4% in the third quarter led by growth in new customers. In our intermodal service line, net revenues decreased 15.9% in the quarter. Intermodal volumes declined 24% as the decline in truckload pricing drove an industry volume shift from intermodal back to truckload. Improved management of in-transit cost drove the net revenue margin expansion in intermodal for the quarter.","Slide 11 outlines our NAST operating income performance. Third quarter operating income decreased 21.3%, while operating margin of 40.6% decreased 420 basis points driven by the net revenue decline partially offset by reduced variable compensation expense in the quarter. NAST headcount was flat in the quarter and average headcount declined 1% sequentially versus the second quarter of 2019.","Regardless of the freight cycle, we will continue to invest in the digital transformation of our NAST business. Our investments are bringing to life new insights and new capabilities for our customers and carriers. The level of automation across our business continues to increase including higher levels of digital order tenders and fully automated shipments in our truckload business. Due in part to this automation, we expect our NAST headcount to be down slightly for the full year.","Slide 12 highlights our performance in Global Forwarding. Third quarter Global Forwarding net revenues increased 1.3%, our acquisition of the Space Cargo Group contributed 3.5 percentage points of net revenue growth in the third quarter. The integration of Space Cargo is going well. We\u2019ve converted most of the agent business to our network, and we\u2019ve retained key employees and customers.","In our ocean service line, net revenues were up 4.1% in the quarter driven by 3 percentage points of net revenue growth from the addition of Space Cargo as well as margin expansion. Ocean volumes were flat in the quarter. Third quarter air net revenues decreased 7.2% driven primarily by an 8% decline in shipments. Space Cargo contributed 6 percentage points of net revenue growth.","Third quarter results in ocean and air were negatively impacted by reduced demand due to tariff uncertainty. Air volumes were also impacted by inherently less demand for the expedited and more expensive nature of air shipments in a soft freight market. Customs net revenues increased 1.8% in the third quarter driven primarily by 1.5% increase in customs transactions. Space Cargo contributed 1 percentage point to the net revenue growth in the quarter.","Within Global Forwarding, we continue to be actively engaged with our customers to help them understand and quantify the impacts of the changing tariff landscape. We once again benefitted from our strong presence in Southeast Asia, where net revenues and volumes continue to outperform the total service line results for both ocean and air. We believe that our broad portfolio service offerings, we remain well positioned to help our customers win in an ever changing global trade environment.","Slide 13 outlines our Global Forwarding operating income performance. Third quarter operating income increased 3.5%, operating margin of 18.2% increased 40 basis points versus last year, driven primarily by higher net revenues and lower variable compensation. Average headcount increased 2.3% in the quarter with Space Cargo contributing 3.5 percentage points to the growth in headcount. Even during this uncertain time in the global landscape, we continue to win record levels of new business. We\u2019re also managing our headcount and our operating expenses both are down on a year-over-year basis versus last year, excluding the impact of Space Cargo.","Moving forward, we see significant opportunities to drive the scale and geographic reach in our Global Forwarding business. And we expect to deliver operating margin expansion over time through a combination of volume growth that exceeds our headcount growth and investments in technology to drive cost efficiency. And over the long-term, we remain confident that we\u2019ll deliver industry leading operating margin performance.","Moving to our All Other and Corporate segment on Slide 14. As a reminder, all other includes Robinson Fresh, Managed Services, Surface Transportation outside of North America, other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses. Third quarter Robinson Fresh net revenues were approximately flat versus last year. Case volumes declined 2.5% due to decisions to exit unprofitable businesses. Robinson Fresh generated 290 basis points of operating margin expansion in the quarter driven by 12% reduction on headcount.","Third quarter Managed Services net revenue increased 7.4% driven by a combination of new customer wins and selling additional services to existing customers. Customers continue to value our transportation management system offering, which allows them to manage their carrier selection process and complex supply chains without the required fixed investment in people or technology.","Managed Services operating margin expanded 100 basis points in the quarter. Other Surface Transportation net revenues increased 13.6% in the quarter with the acquisition of Dema Service adding about 13 percentage points of net revenue growth in the quarter.","On Slide 15, I\u2019m going to wrap up our prepared remarks with a few final comments. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our overall financial results for the quarter fell short of our long-term goals. However, there were several positive highlights. We delivered operating margin expansion in our Global Forwarding, Robinson Fresh, Managed Services, and our European Surface Transportation. And we reduced our operating expenses 3.5% despite increased investments in technology and the impact of the acquisitions of Space Cargo and Dema Services earlier in the year.","Looking ahead, we expect that North American routing guides will continue to reset at lower prices in response to the following cost environment and decline in spot market freight opportunities. In our truckload business, we expect net revenue dollars per shipment to remain below year-ago levels through the first half of 2020. As we expect pricing to remain relatively flat through the bid season in Q4 and in Q1.","Tariff concerns and fears of recession are weakening shipper demand. And while industry data suggests truckload capacity continues to exit the market, we believe capacity will exceed available shipments for the next few quarters. Regardless of the freight environment and the short-term challenges to our results, we remain committed to executing on our customer promise of providing a global suite of services, delivering technology that\u2019s built by and for supply chain experts, leveraging our information advantage drives smarter solutions and having great people that our trading partners can rely on.","We also continue to help our carriers secure freight that best meets their needs and allows them to be successful business owners. I truly believe that our future success will be enabled by technology plus: technology plus our global expertise, technology plus our local knowledge and technology plus outstanding service in industry-leading innovation.","For our investors, our focus areas remain unchanged. We\u2019re committed to taking market share. Over time, we\u2019ve taken market share in each of our largest service lines and we expect to continue to expand market share moving forward.","Second, we\u2019ll continue to leverage our investments in technology to automate and to re-engineer our business processes, reducing both our cost to sell and our cost to serve, while continuing to deliver industry-leading quality service to both our customers and our carriers. And finally, we remain committed to operating margin expansion over time.","I\u2019m proud of our team and I want to thank them for the outstanding efforts they demonstrate every day to ensure the continued success of our company and success of the over 200,000 companies that choose to conduct commerce with C.H. Robinson.","That concludes our prepared comments and with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator so we can answer the submitted questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Mr. Houghton, the floor is yours for the question-and-answer session.","Robert Houghton","Thank you, Donna. First, I would thank the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions after our earnings release yesterday. For today\u2019s Q&A session, I will frame up the question and then turn it over to Bob or Mike for a response.","Our first question for Bob comes from several analysts. North America truckload volume was down in the quarter as spot volumes fell, but volume hasn\u2019t grown year-over-year in 7 of the last 8 quarters. What can the company do to accelerate market share gains?","Robert Biesterfeld","All right, so good morning again, everyone. I\u2019ll start to answer this. But, in 2018, we anticipated that the combination of both strong demand and tight supply, partly due to the implementation of ELDs was going to lead to significant increases in the cost of purchased transportation. We also expected that due to the rising cost environment that that was going to lead to reduction in first tender acceptance rates in 2018.","So our 2018 contractual pricing strategy reflected this higher cost freight environment and resulted in us moving lower in routing guides and receiving less committed freight as such. But at the same time, we drove an 18% increase in our 2018 net revenue dollars for truckload.","In 2019, our awarded freight is outpacing our 2018 awards at an accelerating rate. However, in this current environment, we\u2019re also seeing a lower conversion from awarded freight to actual freight than we usually see. Additionally, as we entered the peak bidding season at the end of last year, into the beginning of this year, frankly, we expected a slightly different market than we\u2019ve experienced this year. And this negatively impacted our awards during that bidding period and it\u2019s carried forward through the first 3 quarters of this year.","With many of our customers, our increased awarded contractual freight is just not making up for the loss of the spot market freight that we executed in 2018 when routing guides are failing. So as you\u2019ve seen in 2019, our volumes are below year ago levels. With that being said, we believe that our strategy is sound and our value proposition is resonating in the marketplace.","We obviously got to get pricing right and aligned to the market conditions and deliver excellent service. But these are really just table stakes. Our volume growth over time is going to be delivered by \u2013 delivering differentiated services to our customers and our carriers in line with the customer promise that I just mentioned.","Our customers continue to tell us that they value our ability to deliver global services with local expertise across all modes. They continue to tell us that they benefit from our industry-leading technology. And above all, they continue to tell us that they appreciate having people, experts in the supply chain that they can rely on.","These are the things that our shippers tell us that give us competitive advantage. The things that differentiate us in the market, and ultimately, the things that are going to help us to lead the market share gains and we\u2019ll continue to focus on these moving forward.","Robert Houghton","The next question is from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc, Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan, and Chris Wetherbee with Citi asked a similar question. Bob, please discuss your ability to reduce costs more in line with the rate of decline in net revenue going forward. How can the business rebuild operating leverage independent of the cycle?","Robert Biesterfeld","Our long-term growth targets that we\u2019ve communicated over time and that we still believe in are centered on the fact that we expect earnings per share to grow at a rate faster than that of net revenue growth. And we didn\u2019t demonstrate that this quarter, but that has been a pillar of our commitment to our shareholders and it remains the core focus.","Our commitment to increasing our investment in technology makes this a little bit more challenging in the short-term. But in the long-term, we wouldn\u2019t be making these investments in tech unless we felt that these investments would accelerate our ability to deliver against this over time. For the quarter, our enterprise operating margins were around 31.7%, which is on the low-end of our historical average over the past few years. But we\u2019re confident that the investments that we\u2019re making are pointed at the right areas that ensure that we can maintain or improve upon these historical operating margins through both beneficial and challenging freight cycles, where net revenue per load will ebb both up and down.","As all of you know our largest lever of expense surrounds personnel. And as we\u2019ve previously stated, our technology investments are largely targeted at increasing the productivity of our staff, so that we can decouple that linear relationship between headcount, and ultimately, personnel expense and volume and revenue.","Robert Houghton","The next question for Bob comes from several analysts. Can you talk about the competitive landscape, particularly whether competitive intensity from traditional players as well as new entrants is greater this cycle? Weakness in volumes is surprising somewhat, given your cost advantage.","Robert Biesterfeld","So if we think about the cycle first, this cycle really hasn\u2019t been much different relative to previous peaks and valleys in freight cycles. As I mentioned before, we got a really good sense of what\u2019s driving our results in terms of volume. And that being really the combination of missing out on some opportunities during the peak bidding season last year and how that\u2019s played out through the first three quarters of this year, along with the significant drop off in spot market.","In terms of competitive intensity, there are certainly some new competitors that are aggressively pursuing market share in this down market that weren\u2019t in play a few years ago. But collectively, they represent a very small percent of the total marketplace. Thinking again about the market, any time that routing guides are operating at near perfection with tender acceptance rates in the high 90% range and the average depth of tender close to 1, you can assume that the market is going to be very competitive on price regardless of competitors, especially coming out of an environment in 2018, where many of our shippers and many shippers in the industry far exceeded their budgets based on the rapid increases in costs.","And right now, they\u2019re actively looking at ways of recouping those costs this year. If we think about the bids, our win rates on bids this year have improved throughout the year. But it\u2019s been against a smaller base of available freight, as we typically see Q4 and Q1 as the highest volume bidding quarters.","We feel really good about our plan going into Q4 of this year and looking forward into 2020. And in some ways, this is just the nature, the cyclical nature of our business. Contracts as you know typically work in one-year cycles. And if you miss out on a bid, you tend to reflect those results for a year. And if you hit on those bids or win on those bids that freight can be at risk in the next year as well.","So we\u2019ve remained really disciplined in our pricing. We\u2019ve chosen not to chase freight that could generate financial losses during this contract cycle, just for the benefit of taking a short-term volume increase.","Robert Houghton","The next question is for Mike and is from Fadi Chamoun with Bank of Montreal. Can you talk about the drivers of the deceleration in net revenue growth from minus 8% in Q3 to minus 15% in October? With comps remaining tough in November and December, should we expect the October trend to continue through the rest of fourth quarter 2019?","Mike Zechmeister","Thanks, Bob. As a reminder, in Q3 this year, we saw total company net revenue per business day down 10% in July, down 4% in August and down 16% in September. October looks similar to September at down 15%. You\u2019re right about the challenging comps in November and December. Last year, we saw net revenues per business day up 11% in November and up 13% in December as our truckload net revenue per shipment was at or near all-time highs driven by the combined benefit of locking in contractual pricing in falling cost environment and spot market opportunities in a tight freight environment.","In Q3 this year, our truckload committed and transactional pricing declined throughout the quarter, in response to the competitive pricing environment. While at the same time, carrier costs moderated sequentially. The result was a reduction in truckload net revenue per shipment as we moved through the quarter and this trend continued into October.","While our truckload volume did improve sequentially from Q3 to October, it was not enough to drive an improvement in total company net revenue growth. To sum it up, while capacity is showing some very early signs of tightening, we don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that would lead us to believe that the freight environment will be significantly different through the first half of 2020.","Robert Houghton","The next question is from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Bob, as you guys execute on your strategy to transform the C.H. Robinson business model into one where you\u2019re leveraging technology to more efficiently execute your customers\u2019 needs, how do you think about the timing of investment to build out that capability to make this a reality relative to the timing of market share gains to leverage them?","Asked another way, could we see a period of elevated expenses over the next couple of years, before the revenue for market share gains really kick in?","Robert Biesterfeld","Good morning, Jack. Thanks for the question. So let\u2019s talk first about market share gains. And this will be an oversimplification. But as I think of the market, there are really two types of freight in North America surface transportation. Let\u2019s call it, complex freight and commodity freight, and that\u2019s not meant to oversimplify and say that shippers that largely ship commodity freight don\u2019t have some complex challenges.","But in order to increase market share gains, each type of freight requires a different solution, both in terms of technology and execution. So in the commodity freight space, think about regular route freight, high velocity freight that moves largely via routing guides with fairly consistent or seasonal volumes.","In this space, we\u2019re investing in technology here to remove friction from both the customer and the carrier in order to maximize yield and efficiency for both parties. So examples of this would be, more accurate algorithmic based pricing, customer-specific rating engines, focused on real-time visibility, digital freight matching and taking manual steps out of the process, which align committed capacity to committed customer relationships, and also moving more towards multi-leg movements, right. So these are all examples of technology and operational investments in the space. Our ability to capitalize on these investments in technology along with our data and operational excellence is what\u2019s going to drive market sharing \u2013 market share gain in that space.","Within the more complex freight, our technology investments are less about driving efficiency and more around driving innovation to solve some really complex supply chain challenges. This involves everything from inventory movement to PO management to executing global on-demand supply chains from, frankly, from first mile to last. And this is really where that tech-plus mantra comes in as technology alone really can\u2019t solve these types of problems.","So beyond the types of freight that we\u2019re moving, we\u2019re also investing in technology, as you know, internally \u2013 both internally developed as well as commercial off-the-shelf software to make our overall business more efficient and our teams more effective. So examples of moving parts of our infrastructure from on-prem to the cloud, so that we can better capitalize on the advancement of data science, implementing a new CRM to help make our sales force even more effective, all these are incremental expenses in technology, where many cases, the expense is going to come before the value that we recognized. So likely there will be some delay between investment and return on that investment.","Robert Houghton","The next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird asked a similar question. Bob, net revenue and EBIT per employee fell dramatically in Q3? Given the softer market, have you considered lowering headcount to better align resources with demand? How do you expect to mitigate decreased productivity looking ahead?","Robert Biesterfeld","All right. So we\u2019re being really mindful about headcount across the enterprise, right now, to include our business divisions as well as all of our corporate functions. If we peel back the onion layers, so to speak, this quarter, our average NAST headcount was down 10 basis points. But the variance between our actual headcount beginning of the quarter and the end of the quarter was more pronounced. We would expect that NAST headcount to continue to decline through the fourth quarter.","Robinson Fresh headcount was down 12% for the quarter. Global Forwarding headcount was down for the quarter excluding Space Cargo and across European Surface Trans and Managed Services, our headcount was up, as we\u2019ve got large customer wins that were in the process of onboarding and implementing, and these businesses frankly have less size and scale, and they required that incremental investment headcount.","Parallel to that, we\u2019ve increased our headcount in our technology team by over 60% in the past couple of years. And we expect this investment in technology headcount to level out, but there is a run rate effect that will play out to the next couple of quarters. As our business processes become more aligned and automation continues to increase, coupled with further consolidation of task-oriented functions across all areas of our business and shared services. We do expect a continued lift through efficiency on a per head basis.","Now I\u2019ve said it on multiple occasions that our goal is to decouple that linear relationship between that change in headcount and volume, and it demonstrates our productivity uplift. And a lot of that technology investment as we\u2019ve talked about is targeted at that goal. So given that personnel, again, as our largest expense, once accomplished we really see significant positive impacts to our operating margins.","Robert Houghton","The next question for Bob is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. What type of demand environment, do you need to see to return to your longer term net revenue, operating income and net revenue targets?","Robert Biesterfeld","Good morning, Chris. Thanks. In our press release and earlier in this call, I made the comment that I feel really good about our team, and how we\u2019re controlling the things that are within our control. And I want to take an opportunity to reiterate that here. Our teams are less focused on the external environmental factors that out of our control then we are on working our plan, staying focused on our customers and driving our long-term strategic plan. That\u2019s not to say that we\u2019re ignorant of those factors, is just to say, that we feel it\u2019s in our best interest to focus on where we can make a direct impact.","So as you\u2019ve seen in the several years, we\u2019ve invested heavily into diversifying our portfolio and expanding our Global Forwarding network. We\u2019re going to continue to do that both organically and via acquisition as we think, it\u2019s the right thing to do for our customers and the right thing for the balance of our portfolio.","We\u2019ve been in the journey the past few years in our NAST business to evolve from this decentralized model of independent offices to a scaled network that operates as one, that truly leverages our scale, our technology platform and our national reach. We\u2019ve obviously increased investments in technology to drive value for our customers and our carriers in new ways and to drive efficiency and automation in our business.","We\u2019ve almost doubled our Managed Services business on the last 5 years, and now managing some of the most complex and global supply chains in the world. We continue to evolve our sales and our go-to-market approach to align our best talent, to our best opportunities, and to drive market share growth. So when I think about the fact that we\u2019ve got no more than 3% market share in any market that we participate in. I think about the initiatives that we have underway across our business. I really don\u2019t think, Chris, that it\u2019s going to be the demand environment to drives our result as much as it\u2019s going to our ability to successfully executing our plan, that\u2019s going to define our success over the next several quarters and several years.","Robert Houghton","The next question is also from Chris Wetherbee for Bob. Can you outline your investments in automation? How much of NAST volume was automated in Q3? And where can this number go on the next or 2, and how would it be reflected in earnings power? Can you also talk, where you see the most opportunity from technology in the next few quarters?","Robert Biesterfeld","All right. Thanks, Chris. Automation has clearly become a broadly used term across our industry, and we\u2019re seeing more and more that is being defined in multiple ways by many different parties in the supply chain. So it\u2019s difficult to give an absolute answer to the question of how automated is our business. So I\u2019ll attempt to just touch on a few different areas of automation and digitalization where we\u2019re focused for both our customers and our carriers.","And so the first area of focus around automation and digitalization is around pricing, so pricing in terms of delivering pricing with greater speed, with greater accuracy and enhancing win rates. So examples of that would be the launch of our Freightquote by C.H. Robinson products, which is delivering pricing across multiple modes to that long-tail of small infrequent customers that we work with.","Our transactional pricing engine or our customer specific pricing bots that we\u2019ve implemented across different TMSs and with specific customers are ways that we\u2019re reducing friction and driving more accurate pricing faster for customers, which I would consider to be automation or digitalization. The second area around automation is around freight distribution, so digital freight matching, yield improvement, multi-leg movements, all leading to reduced friction on the carrier side as well as improved quality for our customers.","The next area of investment on automation is around lead generation and sales force optimization really ensuring that we\u2019ve got the right leads to the right people in order to capitalize in the right opportunity. Kind of this overarching focus on automation or digitalization is around connectivity, right, with over 200,000 companies connected to our Navisphere platform, it\u2019s really important for us that we have the most digital and most connected platform there.","So that we can eliminate manual steps, so that we can improve visibility and so we can reduce friction from quote to cash. And as a bunch of back office stuff that we\u2019re also focused on from an automation standpoint and everything from how we sign up carriers and making that a more automated process to how we manage our AP, AR.","So we\u2019ve got specific goals for moving each of these areas forward, and we are making progress in each area. We just haven\u2019t really distilled the metrics that we\u2019re ready to share publicly on an ongoing basis. If you think about the second part of that question in terms of, we\u2019re reporting the technology investment. Our technology investments are largely going towards 3 areas, creation, innovation and maintenance. So about 60% of our tech dollars are going towards creation, which is really around expanding the capabilities of our Navisphere platform. 20% of our technology dollars are going towards innovation, new technologies, new products and platform extensions. And 20% of our technology dollars are going towards maintenance and infrastructure, ensuring that we\u2019ve got the availability and the integrity of systems that our customers demand.","Robert Houghton","Our next question is for Mike from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer asked a similar question. What was the contract spot mix in Q3? And which way are you headed from here?","Mike Zechmeister","Thanks for the question Ravi and Scott. Our contractual versus spot mix was 70-30 in the quarter in favor of contractual. The general market moves at around 85% contractual during this part of the freight cycle. But due to the fact that we serve so many infrequent shippers in the truckload market that don\u2019t generally utilize contractual arrangements, we tend to cap out at around 70% contractual, while we don\u2019t have precise optics into our contractual versus spot mix going forward.","We will have \u2013 we will likely remain weighted towards contractual volume over the next few quarters. Over an extended freight cycle, we continue to believe that honoring our commitments to our contractual freight, while also securing spot market capacity is the best way to serve our network of customers and carriers, grow our business and maximize shareholder value.","Robert Houghton","The next question is for Bob and comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan asked a similar question. We\u2019ve heard a number of carriers and shippers talk about pulling bids forward and rebidding existing freight to take advantage of lower market rates? Has this provided C.H. Robinson an opportunity to gain market share? Or has this been more of a net negative as it has put greater than expected pressure on your net revenue per load?","Robert Biesterfeld","So interestingly, we actually haven\u2019t seen many shippers pulling bids forward. I think, given most of shippers contractual routing guides are working almost perfectly coupled with the fact that they\u2019re seeing already year-over-year cost savings. I\u2019d say that we\u2019ve seen shippers less likely to actually rebid mid-cycle. One trend that we are seeing here more recently is shippers offering the opportunity to lock-in, what I\u2019d call incumbent volumes for the next bid period at either flat or declining rates in order to keep freight out of upcoming bids and to maintain incumbent volumes.","So given these dynamics and the likelihood of pricing remaining relatively flat in the truckload marketplace in the coming quarter. We do see this as having a potential negative impact on net revenue per load relative to our year-over-year comparisons for the next couple of quarters.","Robert Houghton","Our next question is from Dave Vernon from Bernstein. Bob, what should investors watch for to judge the success of your investments in technology? Is it headcount, margins, growth? And are there any targets for timelines on key metrics that you can share with the market?","Robert Biesterfeld","So my quick answer to that is, yes, right, we\u2019re going to make investments, they have to yield either headcount margin or growth. My longer answer is that we\u2019re looking at several metrics to measure the proof points on the value of these investments. So ultimately, these investments need to impact either our internal or external stakeholders. And we tend to look at these to the lenders of our employees, our carriers, our customers, and of course, our owners or investors. So internally, we\u2019re looking at these investments and how they impact that interplay between headcount and volume, and the efficiency and effectiveness of our employee. So that\u2019s really, the answer, yes, headcount is a factor for us there.","Externally these investments have to impact either our customers or carriers in a positive manner that create unique value for them, normally that value is realized as a reduced cost, better insights or improved service for our customers than increase yields or better experience for carriers. So those factors are really tied to fueling growth. So the combination of those benefits is what\u2019s going to yield more growth with lower relative personnel expenses to manage that growth, which in turn drives to be improved margins that we and our shareholders are expecting.","So we\u2019re continuing to evaluate the right financial and non-financial measures here that we can share broadly and we will do that moving forward.","Robert Houghton","Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer asked, Bob, what is your strategic view for balancing price versus volume?","Robert Biesterfeld","So my general belief is that price is directly correlated the value and the markets ultimately going to set price based on the value that\u2019s being created. In our industry, regardless of we\u2019re talking about NAST, Global Forwarding or any of our operating divisions really, no one party is large enough to drive pricing for entire industry over the long-term. So in the broader freight market of commoditized freight movements that I mentioned earlier, the biggest drivers of price are simply supplying demand, but they are not the only factors that drive price. I also believe that it\u2019s ultimately going to be volume that drives long-term growth. But that volume has to be developed and maintained over time by creating that sustained value over time. Not just by providing the lowest price in a short-term.","So volumes are going to come to those companies that create sustained value through cycles. Our customers continue to tell us that service notably on-time and full, is the number 1 factor that drives purchasing decisions and that technology is impacting over 90% of the purchasing decisions with the customers make.","So as I reflect on our customer base, I am proud of the fact that our top 500 customers, which make up about half of our revenues, showed 100% retention rate over the past year. And over 90% of these customers have been our partners for over a decade. I think that speaks to our ability to create mutually beneficial value. And when it comes to guiding and coaching our teams, I\u2019m always going to guide our teams to seek out that longer-term value and relationship that we can build upon over time versus short-term price driven volume.","Robert Houghton","Brandon Oglenski with Barclays and Chris Wetherbee from Citi asked about M&A. Mike, with several public peers also showing reduced margins in their brokerage operations, is the potential price of an acquisition either at the tuck-in or more strategic variety become more attractive? Are there technology assets that could fit well with the platform you\u2019ve developed that would make C.H. Robinson, even more of a single source platform for customers? And is M&A likely to take a greater role and driving C.H. Robinson\u2019s growth moving forward?","Mike Zechmeister","Yeah, good question, Brandon and Chris. As has been our history, we continue to see M&A as a lever to help us expand our geographic presence add\/or improve services, build scale and enhanced our technology platform. We preferred strong businesses with compelling strategic benefits, good cultural fit, and proven non-asset based business models. Specific to your question on the near-term margins related to this point in the freight cycle. I am not sure that will have a significant impact on overall valuations or long-term prospects.","Let me also add that with respect to the benefit of building scale, we will be selective in our pursuits as we generally believe that we can build scale at a lower cost than buying it. With our strong balance sheet, significantly cash flow generation and liquidity, we are well positioned to capitalize on investment decisions with the strongest returns on a risk adjusted basis whether they are M&A related, technology or other investments.","Robert Houghton","The next question is for Bob, and comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc. Chris Wetherbee asked a similar question. Please discuss the change in customer sell rates falling faster than capacity buy rates during the quarter? This is the first time, since the first quarter of 2018 that buy rates have outpaced sell rates. Does this reflect firming capacity costs or greater than expected price competition? Any additional color on expectations for Q4 2019 would be helpful?","Robert Biesterfeld","Okay. So as you know, we won\u2019t go deep into specific trends within the quarter. But in general, based upon the information that we shared about October about truckload volumes being flat and that revenues for the enterprise being down 15% through October, it\u2019s a fact that margin compression and truckload in carrying forward in our business so far in Q4. In terms of the competitive nature, I feel like I\u2019ve addressed that in a couple of other earlier questions. But I want to address the question on Q3 results and the change in rate and cost relative to Q3 of last year. And I think to do that most effectively, it\u2019s worth widening the aperture a bit to look at the sequential comparison of really what happened over the past couple of years as we\u2019ve got this rapid rise and fall of the market.","And Todd, as you pointed out, it was Q1 of 2018 was the last time that we saw this inflection. So if we go back to Q1 of 2018, we saw pricing peaking at a 21% increase year-over-year followed in Q2 by a 20.5% increase followed by a 14% increase on a year-over-year basis in Q3 of 2018, and then 1.5% increase in Q4 of 2018, before customer pricing reflect a negative in Q1 of 2019, where we saw things down 5.5% that accelerated to down 11.5% in Q2 then down 12.5% in Q3. So we\u2019ve really seeing this rapid rise and fall kind of bookended on either side where price lagged cost.","More recently, if we look at sequentially from Q2 of 2019 to Q3 of 2019, we saw customer pricing drop around 1.5% sequentially, but carrier costs net of fuel actually increased about 1.5% sequentially. So that\u2019s what caused the difference between Q2 and Q3. With the inflection of change in cost being less than that change in sell rate this quarter. I\u2019d say, it\u2019s hard to say if this is a bottom, as we\u2019ve seen in past cycles things tend to bounce around a little bit, before a full recovery.","But our data would show that both buy and sell rates are back to about where they were at this point in 2017, so it kind of feels like we\u2019ve reached back to where we normally would be.","Robert Houghton","Our next question for Bob is from Jack Atkins from Stephens. Would you expect personnel and SG&A expenses to trend lower from 3Q levels? Or is the need to invest in technology going to require additional investments into 2020 that will cause your operating expenses to rise, even if net revenue growth remains under pressure.","Robert Biesterfeld","So I\u2019d anticipate that Q4 will be relatively in line with Q3 as a decline of personnel expense driven by decreased variable compensation and declining headcount will be offset by the run rate of the increase in technology expense.","Robert Houghton","The next question is for Mike from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc, Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan asked a similar question. Please discuss the modest reduction in CapEx for 2019. What is this in relation to? Also, please provide any initial thoughts on 2020 CapEx, if possible.","Mike Zechmeister","Sure. As a reminder, we reduced our 2019 full-year CapEx guidance to $65 million to $75 million from the $80 million to $90 million that we had previously communicated. The reduction is simply a function of more of our technology spend being classified as operating expense as opposed to capital expense. We remain on track to invest approximately $200 million in 2019 in total technology spending.","We also expect to provide 2020 CapEx guidance as a part of our Q4 earnings call.","Robert Houghton","The next question for Bob comes from Matt Young with Morningstar. Chris Wetherbee with Citi asked a similar question. Last quarter, you talked adjusting pricing to reach the top of shippers\u2019 route guides, where much of the freight opportunities reside. Should we expect this strategy to reinvigorate truckload volume trends in the quarters ahead?","Robert Biesterfeld","So we\u2019ve seen our win rates as I said earlier increase through the year in our contractual bids, but against that smaller base of freight available in the past couple of quarters. Given the insights that we have in the routing guide performance in both our Managed Services business, coupled with the feedback that we get from our customers within NAST, we believe that pricing towards the top of the routing guide is still the most likely means to be awarded freight in this environment for contractual freight.","If we look at Q4, our NAST comparisons on the volume side are a bit lower in Q4 than they were in Q3. But regardless of that, we\u2019re continuing to price where we believe the contractual marketplace will level out through the terms of these annual contract commitments. And we\u2019re going to balance our focus on volume growth with that of meeting the commitments of our customers that they expect of us.","We are going to maintain discipline to pricing and we\u2019re not going to chase what I would call unsustainable paper rates during peak bid season, because we need to put ourselves in a position to honor the commitments over the annual nature of these customers\u2019 expectations and not expose ourselves to significant loser loads or negative files just in order to take volume.","Robert Houghton","Our next question for Bob is from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Can you talk about your expectations around peak season in both your domestic markets and your forwarding operations?","Robert Biesterfeld","Yeah, I describe the view of our customers that they\u2019re sharing with us around peak is mixed. In general, uncertainty still seems to kind of reign. We are seeing some customers put in place supply chain continuity programs in order to ensure capacity for the peak season. And others are just playing it out somewhat a status quo.","Looking at our own data, one of the data points that we tend to look at in our truckload business is that of aggregate demand, which is really a measure of absolute tenders that we received. Looking at the trend from Q2, of Q3 this year, we saw an increase in aggregate demand versus a drop sequentially over that same time period last year, so a bit of a different trajectory for us on a year-over-year basis. But I\u2019m really unsure if that\u2019s reflective of the overall market or is anyway a precursor to a differentiated peak season.","We do have a later Thanksgiving this year. So we\u2019ve got about a week less between Thanksgiving and the December holidays than we had last year. So that could compress some of the domestic peak movements that could cause some brief supply chain interruption.","Robert Houghton","The next question is for Bob from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Given uncertain global trade conditions, please address changes in customer behavior with regard to supply chains.","Robert Biesterfeld","The simple answer is that supply chains have shifted in some cases and we feel really well equipped to help our customers manage that given our global network. We mentioned in the call earlier about our increased results and increased volumes in Southeast Asia. But in general, I think there are still just a lot of unknowns. And customers are still trying to figure it out. There is no clear path forward.","Robert Houghton","The next question is for Bob from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Has there been any change in the competitive hiring dynamics following a new entrant\u2019s large headquarter opening in Chicago?","Robert Biesterfeld","No. Chicago is a hub for our North American logistics. infrastructure and our talent. So we\u2019ve been there for over 100 years. I think people know, but Chicago has been our home. And we\u2019ve got over 2,500 people in the Chicago land area. And we continue to attract, hire and retain what we believe to be the best of the best across our different business units.","If you think about the importance of Chicago to us, we\u2019ve got our flagship NAST office in Chicago Central and Lincoln Yards. We\u2019ve got our intermodal headquarters in Chicago. We\u2019ve got our Global Forwarding headquarters in Chicago. We\u2019ve got our TMC Managed Services headquarters in Chicago as well as two other really high-performing NAST offices there out in the suburbs.","So, Chicago is super important for us. We\u2019ve got great talent there and we continue to hold on to that talent and continue to grow and invest in that geography.","Robert Houghton","Our next question for Bob comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Are we preparing for the impact of autonomous trucking on the business, even if it\u2019s only adopted on a small scale?","Robert Biesterfeld","Freight under management or the acronym FUM is something that we think is really important for us. And it\u2019s a measure that we talk about and look at a lot in our business. And we think that FUM or freight under management will be even more important for the future. Today, between our Managed Services business and our traditional brokerage business, we\u2019ve got over $20 billion in freight under management and around 18 million shipments. So once we get to this more autonomous environment whenever that might be, we think this concept of FUM will be even more important.","Our business today is largely built upon optimizing the yield of our motor carriers in Surface Transportation. And part of the reason that carriers choose us today is that flywheel effect within our business that our model provides. We\u2019ve got more freight. They\u2019re able to reduce their empty miles and get greater returns for their assets. But today, there is biases within that model that can make that perfect optimization a little bit more difficult. Customer might have a bias to which underlying carrier that they want to load, based on their experience with the driver. And there\u2019s obvious biases toward drivers\u2019 need and want to go. And typically, they want to get home.","And so, if we do get to this more autonomous state and some of these biases are removed, we think that we\u2019re really best positioned to optimize the yield of those autonomous assets for the same reason that we\u2019re best positioned to optimize the yields of the assets with great truck drivers in the cabs. And we\u2019ve got more truckload freight than anyone else in our industry. We\u2019ve got more freight under management and we\u2019ve got the people and the technology and the experience to drive that process.","Robert Houghton","Our final question is also from Brian Ossenbeck. Bob, have new initiatives such as Robinson Routes and the smaller shipper portal from Freightquote contributed materially in 2019?","Robert Biesterfeld","These are two programs that we\u2019re really excited about, but materiality hasn\u2019t quite emerged with either one of them yet, as they\u2019re both early on in the development and deployment. We\u2019re learning every day in both cases and we expect both of them to become more of a core part of our service offering. If we think about Robinson Routes, which is our ability to create multi-leg movements for carriers, it\u2019s really still on a beta phase. We\u2019re using it largely with dedicated fleets and in specific corridors.","With the Freightquote by C.H. Robinson product, even with just the soft launch of the product that we\u2019ve done in the last quarter, we\u2019ve already brought close to 200,000 unique users into the product and we\u2019re seeing great results in terms of our book to quote ratios, our ability to grow business in that micro\/small segment. And the customer feedback that we\u2019re getting is great.","As we think about how we most effectively serve that long tail of increased \u2013 or infrequent shippers that we have into the future, we really see that Freightquote product is having the opportunity to be just an absolute homerun for us.","Robert Houghton","That concludes the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call.

Robinson Second Quarter 2019 Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, Bob Houghton will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, July 31, 2019.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Bob Houghton, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Bob Houghton","Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. On our call today will be Bob Biesterfeld, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Hagen, Corporate Controller and Interim Chief Financial Officer. Bob and Scott will provide commentary on our 2019 second quarter results. Presentation slides that accompany their remarks can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com. We will follow that with responses to the pre-submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday.","Starting with this quarter, we will be shortening our prepared marks to devote a larger portion of the call to the question-and-answer session. I'd like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation list factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Biesterfeld","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter earnings call. For the second quarter, we achieved 3.5% net revenue growth versus the year-ago period, where net revenues increased 17%. We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of operating margin expansion and an 8% increase to earnings per share. Our North American Surface Transportation business generated 6% net revenue growth in the quarter, and we delivered operating margin expansion in both our NAST and Robinson Fresh businesses.","In Global Forwarding, the integration of the Space Cargo Group is off to a strong start, and we also expanded our Europe Surface Transportation business with the acquisition of Dema Services. And we continue to make improvements in working capital, which combined with the increased earnings, allowed us to generate nearly $200 million in cash flow from operations and increased cash returns to our shareholders. Within our North American business, there's no question that we are in a softer market today than we were a year ago.","Driven by weakening demand and additional capacity, industry-wide truckload transactional volumes and spot market pricing are markedly below year-ago levels. Declining new truck orders and increased carrier bankruptcies suggest that capacity has peaked and is starting to exit the marketplace. Concurrently, the Global Forwarding market is experiencing air and ocean volume declines as shippers work through elevated inventory levels resulting from the volume pull-forward ahead of tariff activity.","However, with this as a backdrop, there were a number of volume highlights in our second quarter. Our truckload contractual volume increased at a low single-digit pace. Truckload and LTL volumes per business day increased sequentially during the quarter. Our truckload and LTL volumes outpaced industry indices, such as the Cass Freight Index, where volumes declined mid-single digits in the second quarter. And ocean volumes included double-digit growth in Southeast Asia as we continue to benefit from our scale in this region amidst tariff uncertainty. With these results, I'd like to recognize the hard work of our people across the globe. Your continued commitment to deliver world-class service and to ensure the success of our customers and carriers is instrumental to our continued success.","So with those introductory comments, I'll turn it over to Scott to review our financial statements.","Scott Hagen","Thank you, Bob, and good morning everyone. Slide 4 shows our financial results for the quarter. Our second quarter total revenues decreased 8.6% driven primarily by lower pricing across most transportation services. Total company net revenues increased 3.5% in the quarter, led by margin improvements in our truckload service line. Second quarter monthly net revenues per business day were up 4% in April, 6% in May and up 1% in June.","Total operating income was up 3.9% over last year. Operating margin improved 10 basis points versus the prior year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.22 in the second quarter, up 8% from $1.13 last year.","Slide 5 covers some other income statement items. The second quarter effective tax rate was 23.4%, down from 25.6% last year. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 25%.","Our second quarter interest and other expense totaled $6.6 million, up from $5.1 million last year. Interest expense declined in the quarter, driven by a reduction in our overall debt balance. The U.S. dollar strengthened against several of our key currencies this quarter, resulting in a favorable impact of $2.8 million from currency revaluations.","The diluted share count was down 1.7% in the quarter as share repurchases were partially offset by the impact of activities in our equity compensation plans. Turning to Slide 6. We had another quarter of strong cash generation. Cash flow from operations totaled nearly $200 million in the second quarter, an 85% increase versus last year. A combination of an improved working capital performance and increased earnings drove the cash flow improvement.","Capital expenditures totaled $17.7 million for the quarter. We expect our rate of capital spending to accelerate in the back half of the year, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be between $80 million and $90 million for the full-year, with the increased spending primarily dedicated to technology.","We also remain on track for $200 million in total technology spending in 2019. We returned nearly $180 million to shareholders in the quarter through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, a 32% increase versus the year-ago period. Our second quarter results represent our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in cash flow from operations.","Our strong cash generation enabled us to increase cash returns to shareholders, fund an acquisition, increase our investments in technology and pay down debt in the second quarter. Moving forward, we will evaluate how to best deploy our capital in ways that create value for our customers, carriers, employees and generate returns for our shareholders.","Now on to the balance sheet on Slide 7. Working capital decreased 10.7% versus 2018 year-end, driven by lower gross revenues and the resulting decrease in accounts receivable.","Our debt balance at the quarter-end was $1.25 billion, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.1% in the quarter. I will wrap up my comments this morning with a look at our current trends. Our consistent practice is to share per business day comparisons of net revenues in North America truckload volume. So far in July 2019, the total company net revenue per business day has decreased approximately 8% and NAST truckload volume has decreased approximately 6%.","In 2018, total company net revenue per business day increased 18% in July, 16% in August and 17% in September. We appreciate you listening this morning. And I will now turn it over to Bob to provide additional context on our segment performance.","Bob Biesterfeld","Thank you, Scott. I'll begin my remarks on our operating segment performance by highlighting the current state of the North America truckload market. Slide 9 shows that rate of price and cost declines accelerated in our NAST truckload business in the second quarter.","Price per mile billed to our customers declined 11.5% while cost per mile paid to our contract carriers net of fuel cost declined 14.5%. Our mix of contractual versus spot market business continued to shift towards more contractual freight during the quarter. As is typical at this point in the freight cycle, the rapid declines in both change in cost and change in customer pricing resulted in improvement in truckload net revenue margin in the quarter. ","Consistent with market trends, we're seeing double-digit declines in spot market pricing and lesser declines in the contractual market. One of the metrics that we use to measure market conditions is the truckload routing guide depth from our Managed Services business, which represents roughly $4 billion in freight under management. Average routing guide depth per tender was 1.2 for the quarter, representing that on average, the first carrier in a shipper's routing guide was executing the shipment in most cases. This route guide depth is among lowest levels we've experienced this decade. And it's a reflection of both softening demand and the reduction in price and cost shown in the slide. In 2019, our pricing strategies have shifted markedly from last year to reflect the current environment and to ensure that we're near the top of our customers' routing guides. ","Turning to Slide 10 in our North American Surface Transportation business. Second quarter NAST net revenues increased 5.8% driven primarily by growth in truckload. Our second quarter volumes outpaced year-over-year changes in the Cass Freight Index for the second consecutive quarter. Truckload net revenues increased 8.6% in the quarter, driven by margin expansion. Our shift towards contractual volume resulted in an approximate mix of 70% contractual and 30% transactional volume in the quarter versus a 55-45 mix in the year-ago period. Our second quarter results include the impact of repricing activity to reflect current market conditions, including modest price declines in contractual awards with several large customers.","Second quarter NAST truckload volume decreased 2.5% versus last year. This volume decline includes the impact of an approximate 50% reduction in our negative loads associated with contractual shipments as profitable volume was up slightly in the quarter despite industry volumes being done. Our account management and carrier teams are doing an excellent job in serving our customers, which is leading to increased awards with our contractual customers. And as a result, our truckload contractual volume increased at a low single-digit pace. ","Consistent with market trends, our spot market volumes declined at a double-digit rate. While we're seeing evidence of a reduction in overall truckload market capacity, we continue to add new carriers to our network, driving further expansion of the largest fleet of motor carriers in North America. We added roughly 4,800 new carriers in the second quarter, which is a 9% increase over last year's second quarter. Carriers are increasingly relying on Robinson to enable them to be successful business owners. In a slowing freight environment such as this, carriers continue to gravitate towards Robinson as we have the largest network of customers and available truckload freight across the 2PL sector in North America.","LTL net revenues increased 2.8%, led by growth in our consolidation and temperature-controlled businesses. LTL volume growth accelerated to 3.5% in the second quarter as we added new customers and renewed awards with existing customers. In our intermodal service line, net revenues decreased 33.8% in the quarter. Intermodal volumes declined 30.5% as a combination of lane reductions related to precision-scheduled railroading and a decline in truckload pricing drove an industry volume shift from intermodal to truckload. ","Slide 11 outlines our NAST operating income performance. Second quarter operating income increased 8.8% while operating margin of 42.1% improved 120 basis points, driven by a combination of net revenue growth and reduced variable compensation expense in the quarter. NAST second quarter results also included a $5 million contingent auto liability claim.","Our investments in technology, along with the refinement in our operating model, have helped us to generate five consecutive quarters of year-over-year operating margin expansion in our NAST business. Our levels of automation are increasing, including higher levels of digital order tenders and fully automated shipments in our truckload business.","Our digital transformation efforts are providing more benefits to our network of customers and carriers and are driving process efficiency for our employees. We continue to expect our NAST headcount to be flat to slightly down for the full year.","Slide 12 highlights our performance in Global Forwarding, which now includes a full quarter of results from our acquisition of the Space Cargo Group, a leading provider of international freight forwarding, customs brokerage and other logistics services in both Spain and Colombia. The integration is going well, and we remain excited about the talented team we brought on the Robinson as well as the opportunity to convert agent business to our network.","Second quarter Global Forwarding net revenues decreased 1.5% with Space Cargo contributing three percentage points of net revenue growth. In our ocean service line, net revenues were down 1.6% in the quarter. Space Cargo contributed two percentage points of net revenue growth. Ocean volumes were up 1% in the quarter.","Second quarter air net revenues decreased 12.2%, driven by lower pricing and a 7.5% decline in shipments. Space Cargo contributed six percentage points of net revenue growth to air. Results in both ocean and air continued to be negatively impacted this quarter as shippers worked through elevated inventory levels resulting from volume pull forward ahead of tariff activity.","Demand for air weakened in the quarter as there's some inherently less demand for the expedited nature of air shipments as inventory levels remained elevated throughout much of the quarter. We are, however, seeing inventory levels start to normalize into the third quarter. Customs net revenue increased 12% in the second quarter, driven by improved mix.","Space Cargo contributed one percentage point to this growth. Customs transactions declined 2% in the quarter. Global shippers continue to plan for tariff activity and potential implication to the redesign of their supply chains. We've remained actively engaged with our customers across the globe to help them understand and quantify the impacts of the changing tariff landscape and to help them engineer the optimal supply chain.","We continue to benefit from our strong presence in Southeast Asia, where second quarter net revenues and volumes grew well ahead of our total service line growth for both ocean and air. Given our broad portfolio of services, our expertise and our global presence, we believe we're very well positioned to help our customers navigate the complexities of executing global supply chains.","Slide 13 outlines our Global Forwarding operating income performance. Second quarter operating income decreased 10.6%. Operating margin of 18.8% decreased 190 basis points versus last year, driven primarily by lower net revenues. Average headcount increased 0.7% in the quarter with Space Cargo contributing 3.5 percentage points to the growth in headcount. While we do see short-term challenges in the freight forwarding market, our teams are doing well in the areas that we can control. We're winning record levels of new business, and we're managing our headcount growth and operating expenses.","Moving forward, we see significant opportunities to continue to drive scale and geographic reach in our Global Forwarding business. We expect to deliver operating margin expansion through a combination of volume growth that exceeds our headcount growth and investments in technology that drive global operating cost efficiency. And over the long term, we remain confident that we'll deliver industry-leading operating margin performance.","Moving to our All Other and Corporate segment on Slide 14. As a reminder, all other includes Robinson Fresh, Managed Services and Surface Transportation outside of North America, other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses. ","Second quarter Robinson Fresh net revenues were down 4.3% from last year. Case volumes declined 7% due to strategic decisions to exit unprofitable businesses. Robinson Fresh generated 300 basis points of operating margin expansion in the quarter. Second quarter Managed Services net revenues were flat and freight under management grew mid-single digits. We have a strong pipeline of new business opportunities in our Managed Services business, and we expect to return to net revenue growth in the third quarter. Other Surface Transportation net revenues increased 3.3% in the quarter with the acquisition of Dema Services adding about 4 percentage points of net revenue growth.","So on Slide 16, I'm going to wrap up our prepared remarks with a few final comments. We posted solid financial results in the quarter. We delivered market share gains in our truckload and LTL service lines and net revenue margin and operating margin both expanded in the quarter while we significantly increased our cash flow from operations and our cash returns to shareholders. These results in the current freight environment are a testament to our employees and their ability to successfully create value for our customers in what is a highly cyclical global freight environment. Our people remain focused on accelerating commerce for the network of customers and carriers that engage our platform.","We do expect this softer freight environment to persist for the balance of the year. In response to the following cost environment, North American trucking routing guides are resetting at lower prices and our net revenue dollars per shipment are moderating. In truckload, after the rapid run-up during 2017 and 2018, pricing and costs are now at\/or below 2016 levels. Tariff concerns and fears of recession are resulting in weakening shipper demand. And while data suggests capacity is starting to exit the market, we believe it could be a few quarters before there's any meaningful reduction in capacity. However, regardless of the freight environment, our focus areas remain unchanged.","As I've said before, we're committed to taking market share. Over time, we've taken market share in each of our largest service lines, and we expect to continue to expand this market share moving forward. Second, we'll continue to automate and reengineer our business processes, reducing our cost to sell and our cost to serve while delivering the industry-leading quality service that our customers and our carriers expect from us. And finally, we remain committed to operating margin expansion. And our investments in technology and process automation will help us to achieve this objective.","To the over 200,000 companies that conduct business on our global platform, our success will continue to be fueled by our ability to create unique value for you through our people, through our process and through our technology. I remain confident and committed that we will continue to deliver industry-leading capabilities and supply chain solutions to help you achieve your goals. I am also confident that we'll continue to provide rewarding career opportunities for our employees and generate strong returns for our shareholders.","That concludes our prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator, so we can answer the submitted questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Mr. Houghton, the floor is yours for the Q&A session.","Bob Houghton","Thank you, Donna. First, I would like to thank the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions after our earnings release yesterday. For today's Q&A session, I will frame up the question and then turn it over to Bob or Scott for a response.","Our first question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Jack Atkins from Stephens and Dave Vernon from Bernstein asked similar questions. What are the primary factors driving the significant fall-off in net revenue performance year-over-year from up 3.5% in the second quarter to down 8% in July? Are there factors that could cause July to be meaningfully worse than what you'd expect for August and September?","Bob Biesterfeld","Good morning, Tom, Jack and Dave, thanks for the question. Results in second quarter decelerated throughout the quarter as our net revenue dollars per load decreased sequentially week-to-week. If we look back from week 22 to week 26, we saw a pretty significant dropoff in our net revenue per truckload until we reached a bit of an equilibrium at around 5% below our historical trailing 10-year average during week 26.","So we\u2019ve seen slight uptick in net revenue per load during the last week of July, but we do anticipate continued pressure on that key metric of net revenue per load based on what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace and where we feel like we\u2019re needing to reprice our business in order to maintain and take volume in this market. By repricing at the current market rates, our win rate on contractual business is really higher than we\u2019ve ever experienced at any time. So we see that as a real positive on the bids that are coming through our process in the second and third quarter. But these awards are coming in at lower margins than what we saw last year.","So this, coupled with contractual customers seeking mid-cycle price relief and really the lack of spot market freight, these factors are going to continue to put pressure on net revenue per load through the balance of this year when comparing to the second half of last. So it\u2019s clear that our path to EPS growth in the second half of this year is really going to need to be driven by meaningful truckload volume growth.","And while I\u2019m not going to attempt predict the results for August or September at this point relative to July, sequentially our growth rate did slow through Q3 last year in truckload. So the comps do get somewhat more favorable as the quarter progresses. But really our success in the third quarter isn\u2019t going to be driven by our comps alone. The team in NAST is, if nothing else, scrappy and aggressive and also very aware that while we\u2019re the largest player in the 3PL market, we still represent less than 3% of the overall truckload marketplace.","And I think it\u2019s important to call out that our incentive systems are all really designed around growth. And so you\u2019re going to see a pretty motivated team in the marketplace right now really focused on driving growth in the second half.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. The next question is from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Todd Fowler with KeyBanc asked a similar question. Truckload volume has declined in six out of the last seven quarters. While it\u2019s clear spot market trends are very soft, what is preventing the return to volume growth, given your significant cost advantage?","Bob Biesterfeld","So there really isn\u2019t an easy answer for this question. And I\u2019d be lying if I said that our goal was to have volume be down in six of the past seven quarters, right. If you look back at the relationship between our truckload volume growth on a quarterly basis and truckload net revenue per shipment over the past several years, what you see is largely a cyclical story. When net revenue per load is down, volume is typically up. When volume is up, net revenue per load is typically down. There\u2019s all sorts of lagging and leading indicators to this that we could talk about. But in short, it\u2019s really been kind of the same cycle for the last several years.","Over the history of Robinson, we\u2019ve largely been focused on maximizing total net revenue across NAST. And this has come with that tradeoff that you\u2019ve seen between volume growth and margin expansion or contraction. ","As I\u2019ve talked in a lot of forums about our work to reengineer our processes, to take cost out of our model, to get further along in evolving our NAST structure and our strategy and to further centralize our pricing support and leveraging things like technology and data science in different ways, our goal is really to change this trajectory. And we need to get to a point where we\u2019re growing volume and taking share regardless of where we\u2019re at in the cycle.","So we\u2019re really proud of the results that we\u2019ve delivered and the story really isn\u2019t all that negative. We\u2019re winning huge awards from some great companies in the contractual space that are far outpacing our awards in contractual freight that we had last year. But in many cases, these awards are not making up for the loss of the spot freights that we executed when routing guides were failing last year for these same companies. So we\u2019re seeing for some of those largest customers volumes trending down.","So we know that we need to be more consistent in our results in order to do this, forcing us to think differently and act differently within our network in order to break through some of these cyclical patterns.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. The next question comes from several analysts. What is your take on truckload industry capacity? Do you see a reduction in carriers or capacity generally?","Bob Biesterfeld","So we\u2019ve obviously seen the same publicly announced carrier bankruptcies and closings and exits from the marketplace that everyone else has seen. And in talking to a lot of the carriers that we work with, there\u2019s certainly a sentiment there around kind of the negative marketplace compared to last year. You couple that with the declines in Class 8 orders, cancellations of orders and just general sentiment around carrier profitability, and you can start to see the tea leaves that are going to probably focus on contraction of capacity. Based on the rate of increase in capacity that we saw the last couple of years and these changing market dynamics, we\u2019d expect many of the smaller carriers that entered fairly rapidly to exit at a pace similar as they entered.","So candidly, if you look at our business, we were a little bit surprised to see the increase in new carriers sign-ups this quarter and seeing that increase by, I think, 9% compared to last year. But we really contribute that to not so much new small carriers entering the market but perhaps those carriers gravitating towards Robinson as they look for other alternatives to keep their equipment moving.","So in many cases, the past is obviously a pretty good predictor of the future. And the past cycles would indicate that when these spot markets start to dry up, we see this downward pressure on rates and we\u2019ll see this contraction in capacity.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. The next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel. We\u2019ve heard reports of increasing price competition, especially on contractual business. To what extent is this true for you? And is it normal or abnormal, given where we are in the freight cycle?","Bob Biesterfeld","I\u2019d really qualify this as a normal part of the freight cycle. In this marketplace, from a contractual standpoint, if you\u2019re not first in the routing guide, you\u2019re last. And so in this market, I\u2019d estimate that somewhere around 85% of all truckload freight is moving under contractual terms right now. As we said in our prepared remarks with a routing guide depth of about 1.2, which is the lowest we\u2019ve seen in the last decade, you\u2019re probably only going to see 5%, maybe 10% of tenders in the contractual market actually fall to secondary carriers or to the spot. So given that balance, the routing guide lead just really isn\u2019t leading to that much opportunity in the spot market, which continues to lead the heavy pressure towards being first in the routing guide, which obviously fuels a lot of competition around price.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. The next question is from several analysts. Is C.H. Robinson seeing a greater impact from tech-focused players in the market? Or are the competitive pressures coming from conventional brokers and the broader market?","Bob Biesterfeld","I think as everyone knows on the call, the competitive landscape that we face spans from the 18,000 registered freight brokers in the U.S., in some cases, many of the asset-based carriers, other IMCs and the forwarders, amongst others. Our market has always been competitive. And today, just like any time in the past, it\u2019s not disproportionately impacted by any one type of competitor. Competition to us is a constant in this fragmented industry. And frankly, we\u2019re not as much focused on our competition because we really prefer to keep our attention focused on how we serve the customers and the carriers and how we create value. So it\u2019s not just saying we\u2019re ignoring the emerging trends amongst competition or the great utilization of technology, but we\u2019re really keeping our focus on the things that we can control.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. The next question comes from Dave Vernon with Bernstein. Are your contract shippers putting downward pressure on your sell rates or otherwise reducing your allocations due to the weak spot market?","Bob Biesterfeld","So the tone through a lot of these questions kind of confirm that there is downward pressure on rates and greater competition for rates. I would add that we have seen some shippers come back outside of normal bidding cycles asking for either rate concessions or term concessions in order for incumbent carriers, such as Robinson, to maintain our incumbent volumes. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unique to us but more a broad marketplace statement.","One thing that\u2019s interesting that we\u2019ve started to see over the last quarter is that with spot markets \u2013 spot market rates being so far below contractual rates in many lanes, instead of shippers following a normal routing guide process, if a first carrier rejects a tender, we\u2019re seeing more and more shippers go directly to the spot market versus going to that secondary carrier in the routing guide, which does have some impact to the level of commitments that get fulfilled. One might think that it\u2019s counter to what we\u2019ve seen in the decline of the spot market volumes. But again, there\u2019s so little freight falling to that second tender position, it really doesn\u2019t compare to where we were last year.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. The next question is from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Have shippers shown any preference for brokers or asset-based carriers so far in 2019? Will this change as both carriers and brokers attempt to move up in the routing guide?","Bob Biesterfeld","Good morning, Brian. We haven\u2019t seen any indication in our contract renewals. And I\u2019d even go back to the fourth quarter of last year, go back for the past few quarters. We haven\u2019t seen any indication that shippers are showing any favor towards either brokerage or assets in any meaningful way compared to past contract cycles. In our experience, smart shippers evaluate the performance of individual providers based upon whatever their key metrics of service, quality, rate, commitment, tender acceptance and make decisions upon their customer experience with the provider more so than favoring or disfavoring a section of capacity providers based on their asset ownership position.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. We\u2019ll give this next question to Scott. Tom Wadewitz with UBS and Fadi Chamoun with Bank of Montreal ask, is NAST net revenue performance meaningfully better or worse than the overall 8% decline in July?","Scott Hagen","NAST net revenue is the primary driver of the overall minus 8% net revenue to change per day in July, driven by declining margins but also by comparisons to a very strong growth in the prior year while we have seen Global Forwarding show up slightly in July.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Scott. The next question is from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc. Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs asked a similar question. Please provide an update on truckload contract pricing. Where are contract renewals currently? And what impact will recent renewals have on gross margin expectations going forward?","Bob Biesterfeld","So as I\u2019ve kind of alluded to, we\u2019re seeing truckload contract pricing that we\u2019re bidding in the second quarter and into the third quarter inflecting negative compared to last year in the contract market. In terms of where renewals are at, on a positive note, our win rates on contractual bids in terms of the percentage of opportunities that we\u2019re winning in the second quarter were twice that of where we were at in fourth quarter and 1.5 times where we were at in first quarter. So we are winning a larger share of the freight that we get visibility to. The other side of that coin though is that frankly there\u2019s just not as much freight being bid during the second quarter as we see in fourth quarter and first quarter. So as we said in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re really targeting to be first in the routing guide for our customers. And that typically is going to drive a lower net revenue per load in that contractual business.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. The next question also comes from Todd Fowler. Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan asked a similar question. How will C.H. Robinson improve operating leverage? What are the main areas Robinson is targeting for efficiencies? And is there an expectation that efficiencies will hit an inflection point at some point? Or is it more of a gradual implementation over an extended period?","Bob Biesterfeld","All right. So there\u2019s a lot to this question and we can probably go on for the rest of the time we have just around this. But I\u2019ll try to touch on a few key areas. But I want to flip the question around a little bit, Todd, and take the focus off us creating internal efficiencies and focus more on how we\u2019re reducing friction and increasing value for really all parties across the supply chain. And of course, by doing that, the focus is on, at the same time, improving efficiency and improving that efficiency internally, which is ultimately what\u2019s going to drive improved operating leverage.","So there\u2019s a lot of areas that we\u2019ve got focus, but I\u2019ll speak to a few of them. The first is around pricing. And so we\u2019ve spent the last few years working to really automate pricing for our customers and our carriers, which allows for faster response time, more accurate bidding, greater compliance to routing guides, et cetera. And so that\u2019s a real area of investment and focus around efficiency and improvement of quality is around pricing.","The second area that gets a lot of press right now is around freight matching and the idea around digital freight matching. We know that the majority of our carriers are small carriers. About 85% of our freight is executed by small carriers. And these carriers tend to have higher empty miles and less efficient networks than do some of the larger carriers. So we\u2019re investing a lot in data science in order to provide them better yields and better matches and reducing their deadhead miles and hopefully helping them to run more efficient businesses. By moving towards a more digital platform for matching, it also eliminates the need for negotiations and takes \u2013 makes us an easier company to work with as well.","And we\u2019ve had fully automated booking and the ability to book tours online for quite some time now. And more and more of our carriers are seeking out that benefit and gravitating towards that option. The third area I\u2019d talk about is around in-transit visibility, both the inventory in motion and inventory at rest. So we feel great about the uptake of our mobile apps. We feel we have one of the most widely used mobile apps and with a really strong stickiness factor with our carriers. We also feel good about our integration with other ELD providers and third parties that allow us to provide real-time visibility to our customers, which has really become table stakes today. And then we\u2019re able to do that without human interactions so that takes a bunch of work off of the desks of our people, which allows them to focus more their time on revenue-generating activities.","The other area that I would speak to is around serving our large base of small or infrequent shippers and providing these small businesses access to markets that they may not have access to on their own, given their scale. So for the last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve been beta testing a new product. And in the second quarter, we brought this product to life in full.","So we built this product based on our learnings from our acquisition of Freightquote and really excited to formally launch the Freightquote by C.H. Robinson product this quarter, which enables any of our customers to go online, get an LTL or a truckload rate at any time, pick their carrier, literally swipe a credit card and be guaranteed capacity to move their shipment based on their needs.","The feedback we've gotten is that the user experience is superfast, it's simple and the feedback has been really positive. And why that's so important is that we've got about 50,000 customers, small businesses that interact with us as these infrequent-type shippers. And today, we have largely a rough economy serving those customers. And so by moving that to a digital experience, we see a real opportunity to help us reduce our cost to serve and provide them a great quality experience. So roll all that together and to answer the question directly, this has and will continue to be an incremental change as we continue to onboard more partners, drive compliance among those partners, continue to innovate and launch new digital tools and concurrently amend our legacy business processes. So as you know, Todd, our main driver of operating expense is personnel expense. And so any and all of these investments, while focused on creating value for customers and carriers, are also targeted at lowering that personnel expense relative to net revenue.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Brian Ossenbeck asked a similar question. Can you provide an update on your automation efforts? Is the softer freight environment more or less conducive to further automation progress?","Bob Biesterfeld","I think I touched on much of this in the previously submitted question from Todd. But in general, we don't see the market as a driving factor around our automation efforts. We've got a clear long-term road map of where we expect to be in terms of the next months, quarters and years. And that will continue to be implemented regardless of where we're at in the cycle.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. Jack Atkins with Stephens asked about headcount growth. Todd Fowler asked a similar question. Where do you anticipate headcount going for the remainder of the year? And do you believe that you can expand net revenue per employee in the second half of 2019? Or does the current operating environment make that difficult?","Bob Biesterfeld","Our focus has been on having our change in headcount really across the enterprise. And NAST specifically lagged out of our change in volume over time. As you saw through the first half of this year, our headcount growth did exceed that of total volume growth slightly. Looking forward based on what we see as our current trajectory, we would expect headcount to decrease sequentially throughout the balance of this year and to finish 2019 flat to down compared to year-end of 2018. So as I said, our focus continues to be on taking share and growing volume. So if volumes are not being up significantly or positively by the end of the year, it is possible that headcount could be up at a rate lesser than where volume growth lands. Given the headwinds \u2013 the second part of that question around net revenue per employee, given the headwinds around truckload net revenue per load in the second half, I do think it will be challenging to increase the net revenue per employee relative to last year's second half.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. Lee Klaskow from Bloomberg asked total 2019 second quarter headcount went up by about 2% sequentially from the first quarter and was driven by a 5% increase in the All Other and Corporate area. Is that technology-related hires? Can you provide any color on what this is? Scott, why don\u2019t you take this one?","Scott Hagen","Sure. A large portion of the 5% increase was driven by the expansion of our IT organization. We have a talented team of 1,000 people in IT, and we continue to hire data scientists and software engineers to accelerate the digital transformation that is critical for our future success. We have spent over $1 billion on technology in the current decade, and we expect to increase our rate of spending on technology to at least $200 million annually over the next five years so that we can better leverage our data to drive insights to our customers, our carriers and to our employees.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Scott. Brian Ossenbeck and Jack Atkins asked about SG&A. What is driving the SG&A per employee higher this quarter, year-over-year and sequentially? Will this remain elevated with the current IT investments? Scott, why don\u2019t you take this one as well?","Scott Hagen","Sure. This is sort of consistent with the last answer. But much of the SG&A increase was driven by investments in technology, particularly expenses related to the integration of our purchased software. And we do expect the technology portion of SG&A expense to remain elevated through the rest of the year.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Scott. The next question is from Matt Young with Morningstar. The global air and ocean forwarding industry is fairly fragmented but not quite as much as the U.S. highway brokerage space. Could you offer some thoughts on C.H. Robinson\u2019s opportunities to grab share in the forwarding market?","Bob Biesterfeld","Sure. Good morning, Matt. So we\u2019re one of the largest NVOs from Asia to North America and the largest from China to the U.S. But we still have such a small fraction of the total global market under management that we see a ton of runway for growth. As we see our results, ocean really dominate the air for us. And we see air as a continued area for growth. We think we\u2019ve got a lot of growth runway in several geographies and across our service portfolio in Global Forwarding. And our approach is going to be similar to what you\u2019ve seen really up this point. Since 2012, we\u2019ve invested about $1 billion into our Global Forwarding business in terms of the acquisition of Phoenix and APC and Milgram and Space Cargo.","So we\u2019re going to continue to run that play, which is a blend between organic and nonorganic growth. So if you think about what we\u2019ve been doing, it\u2019s focused on acquiring solid, founder-led businesses with strong teams with cultural fit that fill in geographies or service needs for us. We then kind of run the play to convert the agent business of those acquisitions to our Robinson network. ","And then we \u2013 frankly, we crossed all the heck out of all of our new Global Forwarding customers with surface trans services and we sell our new Global Forwarding capabilities to our existing surface trans customers. So we see a lot of room for growth in kind of the string of pearls approach and a lot of synergies in the approach for our Global Forwarding business.","Bob Houghton","Thanks Bob. The next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. You noted that current market conditions are expected to continue through the balance of 2019. But what is the feedback you're getting from customers, especially in truckload brokerage with respect to peak season demand outlook, essentially trying to ascertain if expected market weakness is more tied to excess truck capacity, competitive pressures or underlying demand?","Bob Biesterfeld","Yes. Thanks, Jordan. So as I've said, we do think that there are some excess truck capacity in the marketplace today. But I do think that the definition of peak season has continued to evolve over the past several years. And the peak today is much less compressed than it has been in the past. And we attribute a lot of this to e-commerce and how that's changed retailing in general. But today, we tend to measure peak across months and not weeks, which frankly makes it much more manageable. Our belief is that this trend, coupled with the excess capacity, will likely lead to a less robust peak season in the back half of 2019 and 2020.","And that's not to say that there won't be some regional tightness of capacity or short-term increases in spot market demand and pricing. But in general, we don't see anything that would trigger a large-scale change in the market fundamentals.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer asked about less than truckload. Please discuss business conditions in LTL versus prior years of this current cycle or prior cycles and how you foresee this business trending in the intermediate term.","Bob Biesterfeld","Okay. So the way that we report the LTL service line, there's a lot in that. And we include our common carrier LTL business, where we're providing freight to the network of common carriers. We include our consolidation business, which includes consolidation for industries such as retail and automotive as well as just general freight, all kinds, as well as our temperature-controlled consolidation, which focuses on everything from fresh-cut flowers and produce to frozen goods. ","So with that being said, our LTL results at times will not cycle exactly with how you might see some of the other publicly traded LTL carriers report their results. The diversity of our services that we report under LTL is really what's been fueling our growth over the past several years. And we anticipate that mix continuing to drive growth moving forward as we provide this kind of unique and bundled service to our customers. ","Our customer base within LTL really spans virtually all industries and all customer size segments from some of the largest global companies to really mom-and-pop shippers that need that efficient digital solution that I \u2013 and access to market that I talked about earlier. So in terms of our business that's most alike to the other publicly traded LTLs, we saw similar results in the quarter to what you've seen reported in other releases. And that\u2019s pretty consistent weight for shipment decrease as there was less truckload spillover freight hitting the LTL networks. And in general, volume was flattish for the quarter. Much of the financial improvements in LTL for us during the quarter can be attributed to lower purchase line haul transportation costs within that consolidation side of the business.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. Our next question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company asked a similar question. Scott, this one\u2019s for you. Have developments in the global markets affected your target list for M&A? Are there any lanes where you prefer to grow in this type of environment? And would you focus domestically if global freight market slow relative to the U.S.","Scott Hagen","Thanks, Bob. We are always looking at M&A options to expand our geographic presence. This has been a theme for us over the past number of years. They have typically been businesses that are strong financially and are a good cultural fit and a good business model fit. And even if global forward freight marketing slow, we wouldn\u2019t sit on the sidelines if a good opportunity presented itself. We will continue to look at acquisitions that fill geographic space for us and that strengthen our scale. We will also look at companies that would add new services or technology to our platform.","Bob Houghton","Thanks Scott. The next question is from Scott Schneeberger. Please address C.H. Robinson\u2019s opportunity and progress in Managed Services and discuss the company\u2019s ability to leverage this business with other businesses in the portfolio to garner contract wins.","Bob Biesterfeld","I\u2019ll address the question. First off, I wanted to touch a bit on our Q2 results and maybe add some more color to the Managed Services results. And the fact that revenues were flat for the quarter is really a function of timing. We\u2019ve got a really, really solid pipeline of deals for our Managed Services business that have already been closed and several more that are to close in the coming quarters. So we feel like our growth trajectory should be on a pace similar to what you\u2019ve seen in that business over the last couple of years.","So if we peel back Managed Services, TMC is the largest part of that Managed Services business. And they\u2019re really focused on global, complex, multinational, multimodal shippers with really complex supply chains, which lead to complex global integrations. Typically in what this would have been a high-growth business for us, we\u2019re bringing on new supply chain engineers and more talent prior to revenue actually being recognized due to the complexities and the length of time associated with these integrations.","So we\u2019re in a really good place with this business. We expect that the freight under management and the revenue to accelerate in the back half of the year. In terms of the intersection of this Managed Services or TMC business with the other divisions at Robinson, one of the things that differentiates TMC in the marketplace is a commitment to being a neutral platform.","But typically what we see is that the TMC or Managed Services are sold to existing customers of either European Surface Transportation or NAST or Global Forwarding. And so these typically tend to be customers that have a favorable opinion of Robinson to begin with. And when we implement the TMC platform over the top and provide the customer with a neutral platform to manage their bidding, their supply chain management or their routing guides, we typically see Robinson other divisions do very well and maintain or grow share with those customers, given the fact that they're given a neutral platform and solid decision making support to mark with.","Bob Houghton","Thanks Bob. The next question is also from Scott Schneeberger.","C.H. Robinson has been acquisitive in Europe recently. Please discuss your growth opportunity and strategy in Europe, particularly in freight brokerage?","Bob Biesterfeld","We probably don't talk about Europe enough in terms of what we see in the opportunity there. And we've been in Europe for around 25 years now doing freight brokerage. I would say the C.H. Robinson model is one that's not that common in the European marketplace as with most surface transportation companies tend to have more blended model between assets and independent contractors or brokered carriers tend to be more of the integrators.","Our growth in Europe has been a blend of organic and acquired growth over time with the latest acquired company prior to Dema being Apreo Logistics back in 2012. Today, with the acquisition of Dema Services, we gained some density in the Italian marketplace, which we didn't previously have. And we added some great people, which will help us to continue to build out our scale and expertise in the market. If we look at Europe Surface Transportation independently, in total, we've got 37 offices there across 16 countries and about 650 people executing Surface Transportation for a wide variety of customers in Europe.","I'd say there's a few things over the past couple of years that have evolved in a really positive manner that are worth sharing. And the first is that we've really strengthened our leadership in terms of the talent that we have within Europe. We built a really strong leadership team there based \u2013 local leaders versus expats. And we've also become much more focused on driving truckload growth with enterprise clients, whereas in the past, we were maybe more of an overflow carrier for the marketplace.","So one of the great things about our Europe surface trans business is that we're able to share a lot of learning\u2019s and a lot of technology back and forth between our NAST business and European surface trans. So while there are certainly differences and intricacies between the two businesses, there's a lot of learnings that we can take back and forth, which allow us to accelerate our development in Europe. Given that, that European marketplace is equal to or greater than in size to the U.S. truckload marketplace, we're really committed to continuing to invest and growing in that space.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Bruce Chan asked a similar question. What will be the impact of IMO 2020 on the Global Forwarding business?","Bob Biesterfeld","We really view the impacts of IMO 2020 to largely be a pass-through for us. Should the increased costs and the forecast of the impacts of IMO to the steamship lines lead to further consolidation of capacity or reduction of capacity or in any way interfere with global trade, that could certainly have adverse impacts to our Global Forwarding business. But at its face value, we see the cost impacts as being a pass-through.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. Scott, another question for you. Allison Landry with Credit Suisse asked about working capital. You've made good progress on working capital efficiency. Can you discuss how much further you might have as far as optimizing accounts receivable and accounts payable?","Scott Hagen","Sure. We are pleased with the progress on working capital efficiency. We also feel we have room to continue to optimize our working capital performance. We have a number of initiatives underway to improve our cash conversion while continuing to provide a high level of service and support to our network of customers and carriers and vendors.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Scott. The next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch asked a similar question. Can net revenue margins increase year-over-year in the second half of 2019 with the truckload spot and contract rate gap closing?","Bob Biesterfeld","I think as you know, we tend to manage our business to net revenue dollars per shipment versus net revenue margin just because of all the noise around net revenue margin. And given the current market conditions and our forecast for the market for the balance of this year though, we would anticipate net revenue dollars on a per load basis to decrease compared to the second half of 2018, where we experience net revenue dollars on a per load basis well above our 10 year moving average.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. And our final question is from Scott Schneeberger. Please provide perspective on your intermediate term and long-term margin objective for the Global Forwarding business.","Bob Biesterfeld","So for Global Forwarding, as we've been integrating companies over the past few years and bringing all these global companies onto a single system, there's been an outsized investment in technology for Global Forwarding business. We've more than doubled our investment in technology for Global Forwarding over the course of the last several years. Also with the acquisition, there's a fair amount of impact to purchase price amortization. But if we think about our target operating margin for that Global Forwarding business, we look in the intermediate term to moving that towards the high-20s. And the ultimate goal is to have that in the low-30s for that GF portfolio.","Bob Houghton","Thanks, Bob. That concludes the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. A replay of today\u2019s call will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com at approximately 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.

And you may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."],"4458":["C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) Q2 2018 Earnings Call August  1, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson Second Quarter 2018 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, Bob Houghton will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, August 1, 2018.","I will now turn the conference over to Bob Houghton, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Andy Clarke, Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Biesterfeld, Chief Operating Officer and President of North American Surface Transportation. John, Andy, and Bob will provide commentary on our 2018 second quarter results. Presentation slides that accompany their remarks can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com. We will follow that with responses to the pre-submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday. I'd like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements.","Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.","And with that, I will turn the call over to John.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob, Thanks, bob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. In my opening remarks, I want to highlight some of the headline themes that you'll be hearing us talk about.","First, we are pleased with our overall financial results this quarter. Volume trends improved in the quarter with volume growth in most of our service lines. We delivered a double-digit increase in both net revenues and operating income, and 90 basis point increase in operating income margin. Combined with the benefits of U.S. tax reform, this strong performance enabled us to increase our cash returns to shareholders by nearly 30% in the quarter. Andy and Bob will provide more color on our financial performance in their prepared remarks.","We continue to see very high freight demand in the marketplace. Our results through July reflect that and our customer interactions reflect expectations for continued high demand for the remainder of the year. Demand side of the equation is obviously driven by a healthy economy, and it's the more volatile part of the supply and demand relationship. On the supply side, we see high orders for new equipment, driver shortages, and significant logging device impacts on certain lanes and a lot of capacity owners realigning their networks and freight preferences to adjust to the market.","While our cost and pricing charts show some leveling off of the significant year-over-year price increases, we do expect the market to remain tight for the remainder of the year. Pricing continues to escalate. We experienced another quarter of double-digit cost and price increases across most of our service lines this quarter. We now have pricing reflective of marketplace conditions across the significant portion of our business portfolio. This contributed to our sequential improvement in net revenues.","In our North America truckload business, pricing increased 20.5% in the quarter, approximately in line with carrier cost increases. Our second quarter price increases also reflect an increase in spot market activity that is typical of a rapidly rising price environment. The strength of our business model is the ability to balance our portfolio between long standing customer contractual relationships and our ability to participate in spot market freight opportunities, all while delivering supply chain expertise to both shippers and carriers around the globe. In the current freight environment, we are seeing shipper routing guides deteriorate, resulting in a shift in freight volume into the spot market.","We are focused on continuing to honor our customer commitments while also helping our customers secure spot market capacity. We firmly believe the right business model is to leverage our people, process, and technology to drive balanced growth over time, leveraging our supply chain expertise to build long-term committed relationships with shippers and carriers around the world, while also fulfilling spot market opportunities when they become available.","With those introductory comments I'll turn it over to Andy to review our financial statements.","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by recognizing the hard work of the entire Robinson team across our global network in this volatile freight environment. Your performance was best in class, as we continue to reach new milestones, then push through them to even greater ones. Our organization is always striving for ways of doing it better, but it is also important to say thank you and keep up the good work.","We saw a double-digit increase in both net revenues and operating profit, while continuing to make significant investments for future growth. We also delivered operating margin expansion in our NAST, Managed Services and European Surface Transportation businesses. Congratulations to the Global Forwarding team, which grew operating income on a year-over-year basis and made significant sequential operating margin improvement.","While the Robinson Fresh team continues to work exceptionally hard in this challenging environment, profits fell short of expectations. ELDs and award management have had an out-sized negative impact on Robinson Fresh. Bob will share our plans to improve profitability of this business segment in his prepared remarks. Now on to slide four and our financial results.","Second quarter total revenues increased 15.3% to $4.3 billion driven by significantly higher pricing across most service lines, volume growth in LTL and Global Forwarding, and higher fuel costs. Total company net revenues increased nearly $100 million, or 17% in the quarter. Net revenue growth was led by truckload services, up $59 million, and LTL services, up $17 million. We continue to see the benefits of investments in our Global Forwarding business, where net revenues increased 19% or $23 million in the quarter.","Total operating expenses increased $61 million, a 15.4% increase versus the prior year period. Personnel expenses increased 19.8% in the quarter, primarily as the result of an increase in our variable compensation, which is based on our improved financial performance. We believe performance-based pay is the best way to align the interest of our employees with our shareholders. We expect variable compensation to be elevated for the full year, given our stronger performance in 2018 versus 2017. Total company average head count increased 4.2% in the quarter, led by increased head count to support the growth opportunities in Global Forwarding, as well as the acquisition of Milgram. These increases were partially offset by head count declines in Robinson Fresh and NAST.","SG&A expenses were up slightly in the quarter to $112 million, primarily driven by increases in occupancy, purchased services and equipment rental and maintenance. These were partially offset by a decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts and travel and entertainment expenses. Total operating income was $219 million in the second quarter, up 20.5% over last year.","Operating income as a percent of net revenues was 32.6%, a 90 basis point improvement versus last year's second quarter, and a 200 basis point improvement versus the first quarter of this year. Our objective is to grow operating income at a rate equal to or greater than net revenues. And while we still have work to do in this area, our teams made nice strides in this quarter.","We will continue to invest in our people, our processes, and our technology to drive growth in our business, and to make our operations more efficient. Second quarter net income of $159 million increased 43.3%, which includes an $18.4 million benefit from the U.S. tax reform act passed in December of 2017. We produced diluted earnings per share of $1.13 in the second quarter, up from $0.78 last year.","On to slide five and other items impacting net income. The second quarter effective tax rate was 25.6%, down from 35.6% last year. The lower tax rate was driven primarily by the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate. Our year-to-date tax rate was 23.6%, and we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 24% and 25% for the full year.","As noted in our first quarter earnings call, we adopted the new accounting standards update for revenue recognition in the first quarter of this year. As a result, in-transit shipments are now included in our financial results. We do not expect this policy to have a material impact on our overall operating results, however, it does significantly decrease gross revenues in our Robinson Fresh sourcing, and in the second quarter of this year, that impact was approximately $28 million. There are, however, no impacts to net revenues.","Second quarter interest and other expense totaled $5.1 million, down from $9.4 million last year. Every quarter, we are required to revalue our U.S. dollar working capital and cash balances against the functional currency in each country where we conduct business and hold U.S. dollars. The resulting gain or loss is reflected on the income statement. The U.S. dollar strengthened against several of our key currencies this quarter, including the RMB, the Euro and Mexican peso, resulting in an $8 million gain from currency revaluation. Future movements in our currency valuations will continue to have an impact on our net income. The decrease on this line was partially offset by higher interest expense, due to increased debt levels and higher variable interest rates.","Our share count in the quarter was down nearly 1% as share repurchases were partially offset by the impact of activity in our equity compensation plans.","Turning to slide six, cash flow from operations totaled $108 million in the second quarter, up 88% versus last year, driven primarily by growth in net income. For the first six months, cash flow from operations increased 106% to $308 million. A combination of increased earnings and improved working capital performance drove the year-to-date cash flow improvement. We continue to expect to drive strong cash flow performance in the back half of the year. Capital expenditures totaled $14.6 million for the quarter, and we continue to expect full year capital expenditures of between $60 million and $70 million, with the majority dedicated to technology.","Our capital distribution is summarized on slide 7. We returned over $136 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends in the quarter, a 30% increase versus the year-ago period. Year-to-date, we have returned over $270 million to shareholders, a 25% increase. We continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy our capital in ways that both add value to our customers and improve financial performance. Acquisitions that fit our strategies, business model and culture remain a top priority for us. We have returned over $2.8 billion to shareholders over the last five years, and we will continue to reward our shareholders with capital distributions moving forward.","Now on to the balance sheet on slide 8, working capital increased 9.2% versus the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by increased gross revenues, and the resulting increase in accounts receivable. The contract assets and accrued transportation expense lines on the balance sheet reflect in-transit activity in accordance with the adoption of the revenue recognition policy. We continue to experience improvement in DSOs versus both the end of 2017 and Q1 of 2018, despite the fact that gross revenue increased over $300 million in both periods. Our debt balance at quarter end was $1.4 billion.","Across our credit facility, private placement debt, AR securitization, and senior notes, our weighted average interest rate was 3.9% in the quarter. I will wrap up my comments this morning with a look at our current trends.","Our consistent practice is to share the per-business-day comparison of net revenues. This July has one additional business day versus the prior year. July 2018 global net revenue per business day has increased 20%. Truckload volume has decreased approximately 2% versus the year-ago period where volumes increased 3%.","We are pleased with our continued sequential improvement in truckload volume performance and our strong total company net revenue growth per day in July. We do expect our net revenue growth rate to moderate towards the end of the quarter, as we begin to lap the tightening in the truckload market from weather-related disruptions which began in the last week of August of 2017. As a reminder, third quarter 2017 net revenue per business day increased 3% in July, 4% in August, and 18% in September.","Before I turn the call over to Bob, I'd like to express our thanks to all of the people at Robinson from across the globe that work every day to make our customers, our suppliers, our fellow colleagues, and our shareholders successful. Global logistics and transportation is an industry that has been and will always be both volatile and extremely competitive. Our performance is evaluated every day. Your commitment to excellence has shown through in these results and we thank you.","We appreciate you all listening in this morning. And I will now turn it over to Bob to provide additional context on our segment performance.","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Andy. Good morning, everyone. I'm excited to have the opportunity to speak with all of you today and provide an update on our operating segment performance. To set the stage for the performance discussion, I want to first highlight the volatile nature of the logistics market. On slide 10, the light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in North America truckload rate and cost per mile to both customers and carriers, net of fuel costs since 2008. The gray line represents the net revenue margin for all transportation services. As John mentioned in his opening remarks, the change in North America truckload rate per mile and cost per mile were both around 20% this quarter. This level of increase remains near the highest levels we've seen in this decade. You can see that despite the high level of volatility in the freight market, we are able to maintain our margins through these extended freight cycles.","Our second quarter transportation net revenue margin of 16.2% is up 80 basis points versus the same period five years ago, and our annual net revenues have increased over $715 million during this five-year time period. One of the metrics that we use to measure market capacity and volatility is the routing guide depth from our Managed Services business. In the second quarter, average routing guide depth was 1.8, representing that on average the second carrier in a shipper's routing guide was executing the shipment in most cases. The quarter also included weeks where the routing guides spiked to 5 in certain parts of the country, indicating periods of localized displacement between both supply and demand. By comparison, average routing guide depth in a balanced market is roughly 1.4. So, we do remain in a tight capacity environment.","We think this chart does a great job illustrating the high degree of cyclicality and volatility in our North American trucking market. The broad-based increases in market pricing over the past four quarters have been challenging for our industry and our customers. I'd like to recognize our employees across North America that are working to bring innovative solutions that help customers navigate this marketplace and consistently provide a great experience to the increasing number of motor carriers across our network. The fact that these carriers choose to work with C.H. Robinson makes it possible for us to serve our customers in this dynamic and fast-changing environment.","While the chart on slide 10 indicates that the year-over-year change in price and cost moderated slightly versus last quarter, the absolute price per mile and cost per mile continue to increase. We are introducing a new slide this quarter that shows the underlying price and cost data from the previous slide. The graph on slide 11 shows North America truckload average price per mile and cost per mile since 2010 for C.H. Robinson. We have excluded the actual price per mile and cost per mile scale on the slide to protect our proprietary data. The second quarter represents the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential increases in our North America truckload price per mile and cost per mile. This chart also shows that since 2010 we've continued to adjust our pricing in response to changes in marketplace conditions. We've generally maintained a consistent gap between price and cost, even in periods of high inflation. Despite significant levels of freight market volatility, both customer pricing and carrier costs have increased at a rough 3% annual average rate over this time period.","Turning to slide 12 and our North America Surface Transportation business. NAST net revenues increased 21.4% to $437 million in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in each of our service lines. In the truckload market, continued strong demand and tight capacity have led to another quarter of sharp increases in freight costs. In our contractual business, we worked with our customers to adjust pricing to reflect the rising cost environment while continuing to honor our commitments across our portfolio of contractual freight. Our teams were also active in helping customers secure capacity within the spot market as routing guides failed. Led by higher pricing, our net revenues increased 22.9% to $307 million in the quarter. Repricing activity did negatively impact our volumes in the quarter, as double-digit growth in the transactional shipments were offset by the declines in contractual shipments. NAST truckload volume declined 4.5% versus the year-ago period where volume increased 8%. The combination of contractual volume declines and transactional volume growth resulted in an approximate mix of 55% contractual and 45% transactional volume for the quarter, versus a 65% contractual and 35% transactional mix in the year-ago period.","Our truckload volume trends improved in the second quarter and into the start of the third quarter.","Truckload volume per day has improved sequentially every month this year and declined just 2% in July. We have successfully repriced much of our contractual portfolio over the last couple of quarters and we're confident in our ability to execute against our contractual opportunities through the remainder of this year. So, we expect that our volume performance will improve as we move through the balance of 2018. At the same time, we will remain disciplined on pricing and will continue to adjust our pricing to reflect market conditions. Our goal remains balanced growth within our NAST truckload business and a long-term focus on taking market share and growing volumes above industry benchmarks. We started to close this volume gap versus industry benchmarks in the second quarter and in July.","The hard enforcement of the ELD mandate that took effect on April 1 is not slowing our rate of new carrier adoption. In fact, our new carrier adoption rate is increasing. We added roughly 4,400 new carriers in the second quarter, which is a 19% increase over last year's second quarter and a 5% sequential improvement versus first quarter of this year. These new carriers moved approximately 19,000 shipments for us in the quarter, contributing to our sequential improvement in truckload volume performance. Carriers continue to see C.H. Robinson as a third-party logistics company of choice for securing freight that meets their needs and allows them to be successful business owners. The addition of thousands of motor carriers every quarter allows C.H. Robinson to expand the largest network of motor carriers in North America and bring new solutions to life for our customers.","In our less-than-truckload business, we delivered another quarter of strong performance. Net revenues increased 17.8% to $114 million, driven by double-digit increases in pricing and a 6% increase in volume, primarily driven by growth in manufacturing and e-commerce. Within our intermodal service line, net revenues increased 17.3% in the quarter. This was driven by higher pricing and a 3.5% increase in volume. Our results are benefiting from new technology that we launched last quarter that allows us to more efficiently move freight within our customer's network from the road to the rail.","Slide 13 outlines our NAST operating income performance. Second quarter operating income increased 31.6% to $185 million. Operating margin improved 330 basis points to 42.3% and improved 30 basis points sequentially. This strong NAST performance includes the impact of higher variable compensation expense. And as Andy mentioned, we believe performance-based pay is the best way to align employee and shareholder interest, and this is reflected in our strong NAST operating performance results this quarter. I'd like to thank the entire NAST organization for another quarter of strong financial performance and for helping our customers and our carriers navigate this challenging freight environment.","Within NAST, we also continue to make progress against our efficiency and productivity initiatives as well. Our technology investments are driving productivity through tools that automate our customer and our carrier interactions and further improve our ability to profitably match both shippers and carriers. We're selectively consolidating activities and office locations across our network to continue to maximize our scale. As a result, the rate of head count growth in NAST continues to decline and was down nearly 1% in the quarter. We continue to expect NAST head count to be flat to down modestly for the full year.","Turning to slide 14 and our Global Forwarding business. Global Forwarding net revenues increased 19% to $144 million in the quarter, with pricing and volume growth in each of our service lines. Our acquisition of Milgram & Company in Canada contributed approximately 4.5 percentage points to the growth in the quarter. Ocean net revenues increased 18.5% in the quarter with Milgram contributing approximately 2 percentage points to that growth. Ocean's shipments increased 7% in the quarter through a combination of growth with existing customers and new business wins. With the robust sales pipeline of both new and existing customers, we do expect continued growth in our Ocean business over the balance of this year. Second quarter Air net revenues increased 17.4% with Milgram contributing approximately 2 percentage points. Air shipments increased approximately 9% in the quarter as we continue to benefit from investments to grow volume and density in our air gateway cities.","Our second quarter results also include adjustments to pricing that reflect current market conditions. Customs net revenue increased 27.5% in the quarter with Milgram contributing 21 percentage points to this growth. Customs transactions increased approximately 60% in the second quarter as we continue to execute our strategy of broadening our service portfolio and expanding our customs presence across the globe. Our Global Forwarding business continues to benefit from an expanded service offering and geographic footprint. The second quarter of 2018 represents the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit net revenue growth. This is terrific performance by our Global Forwarding team.","Slide 15 outlines our Global Forwarding operating income performance. Second quarter operating income increased 7.6% to $30 million. Operating margin declined 220 basis points year-over-year to 20.7%. Operating expenses increased 22.4% in the quarter, driven primarily by a 17.8% increase in head count and higher variable compensation expense. Milgram accounted for approximately 7.5 percentage points of the head count growth. As we stated on last quarter's earnings call, Global Forwarding first quarter profit performance fell well below our expectations.","We challenged our Global Forwarding organization to rapidly deploy a plan for improving their business results and they rose to the challenge. As you can see on slide 16, Global Forwarding's second quarter operating income increased 262% on a sequential basis and sequential operating margin improved 1,400 basis points. Net revenue increased sequentially in all service lines and average head count declined 1% versus the prior quarter while sequential SG&A declined 8%, led by lower bad debt and tighter operating expense controls. We are very pleased with this rapid turnaround of profitability and I'd like to offer a very strong congratulations to Mike Short and the entire Global Forwarding team for their outstanding execution this quarter.","Moving forward, we continue to see significant opportunities to drive scale and geographic reach in our Global Forwarding business. Driving this growth will require continued investments in people, process, and technology, but we also realize that we have opportunities to drive greater efficiency as we grow this business. We'll continue to be focused on the significant top-line growth opportunities in front of us across the globe, and we'll also be focused on operating margin expansion through digital transformation led by additional technology deployment and intelligent process automation. Over the long term, we continue to expect our operating margin performance to be consistent with other leading companies in the Global Forwarding segment of the market.","Transitioning to slide 17 and our Robinson Fresh segment. Sourcing net revenues were $32 million for the quarter, down 10.3% from last year. Case volumes declined 6%, primarily due to a strategic customer exiting the fresh produce business and lower levels of customer promotional activity within retail. Higher purchased transportation costs also contributed to the net revenue decline. The revenue recognition policy change negatively impacted sourcing total revenues by approximately $28 million, but there was no impact to net revenue. Transportation net revenues of $24 million were 6.6% below year-ago levels. Truckload volume declines and margin compression in our committed business were partially offset by an increase in the revenue per shipment in transactional business as well as the volume growth in our LTL business.","Slide 18 outlines our Robinson Fresh operating income performance. Second quarter operating income declined 35.2% to $9 million. Operating margin declined 680 basis points to 16.6%. Operating expenses decreased slightly in the quarter as a 7% reduction in head count and a 9% reduction in SG&A were partially offset by increased variable compensation expense. Robinson Fresh second quarter results also include a $4 million contingent auto liability claim. To be clear, this level of profit performance fell well below our expectation and we are not satisfied with the erosion of the profitability of this business over the last several quarters. The hard enforcement of the ELD mandate has had a greater impact on the temperature-controlled and multi-stop, multi-fit loads that are common in the fresh produce business. Our Robinson Fresh business has a more concentrated set of customers with longer-term contractual relationships than our other business segments. So, we do not have the same amount of transactional business as in our NAST portfolio to offset the margin compression on committed business. Many long-term committed customers were repriced during the second quarter and we'll continue to look for opportunities to reprice our Robinson Fresh business to reflect marketplace conditions as the year progresses. We've also exited certain facilities within the network, invested in technology to improve our sourcing office efficiency, and implemented stringent operating expense controls.","Moving to our all other and corporate businesses on slide 19. As a reminder, all other includes our Managed Services business, Surface Transportation outside of North America, other miscellaneous revenues, and unallocated corporate expenses. Managed Services net revenues increased 10.5% to $20.1 million in the quarter, driven by a combination of selling additional service lines to existing customers and new customer wins. Customers value our transportation management system, which allows them to control their carrier-selection process and manage their complex supply chains without the required investment in technology. Freight under management increased 7% in the quarter to nearly $1 billion. The highly automated nature of this business enabled us to not only invest for customer and geographic growth but still expand operating income margins by 10 basis points. Other Surface Transportation net revenues increased 8.5% in the quarter to $15 million. The increase was primarily the result of pricing increases in our European truckload business. We have a strong pipeline of new business, and we expect volume trends to also improve in this business throughout the third quarter.","Before I turn the call back to John for some final comments, I'll take a minute to wrap up the section on our business unit performance. We delivered strong overall business results this quarter with significant top and bottom line growth and expanding profit margins. Through a challenging and dynamic freight environment, we assisted our customers in navigating the marketplace and helped them accelerate commerce in their businesses.","As we move through the balance of 2018 and beyond, I'm energized by the opportunities ahead of us. We will leverage our comprehensive offering of services and capabilities to deliver logistics expertise for our customers and our carriers. We remain focused on driving innovation and productivity via digital transformation, and we will continue to accelerate our investments in emerging technology and advanced analytics to further transform how we continue to add value to our global ecosystem of over 120,000 customers and 73,000 active carriers. Driving this success will be our people, our processes and our technology. I'm highly confident we'll continue to deliver industry leading capabilities to our customers and our carriers and strong returns to our shareholders.","Thank you for listening this morning, and I'll turn it back to John now to make some closing comments before we address your pre-submitted questions.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. Before we move to those questions, I'll wrap up our prepared remarks with some comments on our expectations for the balance of 2018. As stated earlier, we believe that the current freight market fundamentals will remain in place for the remainder of the year. With a healthy economy, demand for freight will remain strong. While an increase in new equipment orders may suggest an increase in capacity, we believe the aging truck driver demographics and declining number of new truck drivers combined with the impact of the April 1 hard enforcement of ELDs will continue to constrain capacity. So, we expect the market to remain tight through 2018.","We're closely monitoring the escalating tariff activity. The current tariffs that are in place did not have an adverse impact on our first half financial results. Our primary focus has been to work with our customers to help them understand and quantify the impacts or potential impacts of some of the proposed tariffs. We're also working to ensure proper compliance for all enacted tariffs. While the cost of the tariff is ultimately borne by the shipper, our business could be negatively impacted by any resulting slowdown in global trade or redesigning of global supply chains that negatively impacts our customers' shipment activity.","We will continue to monitor this situation and work closely with our customers and to adapt to any required changes. We remain focused on working closely with our customers to help them understand the market and to ensure we both meet our customer commitments and achieve pricing reflective of the marketplace conditions. We continue to invest in our people, our processes and our technology to deliver an expanding set of insights and capabilities that increase the value of the supply chain expertise we deliver to our customers and carriers. And we remain focused on operating cost efficiency, driving higher levels of service execution for our employees, and increasing returns to our shareholders.","Lastly, I too would like to personally thank the over 15,000 C.H. Robinson team members around the world for their outstanding efforts in delivering strong operating results this quarter. In a rapidly changing freight environment, we were able to deliver double-digit growth in net revenues, operating profit, and earnings per share while continuing to invest in the digital transformation that enables us to provide increased value to our customers, carriers, employees and shareholders. We returned $136 million to shareholders this quarter and delivered a significant improvement in our operating cash flow. We delivered strong results in the quarter, and I'm confident that we have the right people, processes, and technology to continue to win in the marketplace. That concludes our prepared comments, and with that, I'll turn it back to the operator, so we can answer the pre-submitted questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Houghton, the floor is yours for the question-and-answer session.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Donna. First, I would like to thank the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions after our earnings release yesterday. For today's Q&A session, I will frame up the question and then turn it over to John, Andy, or Bob for a response.","And the first question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. John, how do you view the potential duration of the current freight cycle? Your comments around a strong outlook for the remainder of 2018 are encouraging, but is there anything on the horizon from a supply or demand perspective that you believe could disrupt the cycle from persisting well into 2019?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","As we all know that the markets are moving faster than ever, and in a lot of ways maybe harder to predict. But just to share a little more color on, kind of, our view of the marketplace today, we have always believed and continue to believe that in the supply and demand relationship, the demand is more the trigger point or the more volatile variable in the two equations. Evidenced by even this current cycle where ELDs and some of the capacity constraints are clearly an important factor, but really the tipping point was the hurricanes and the spike of expedited demand services in the fall of a year ago. So while it's hard to predict these cycles, we do feel like the overall demand, the healthy economy, and the likelihood that that will continue for the remainder of the year is what will keep that market tight.","Many of you probably know better than we do what would cause a recession or a significant change in the demand to look for the freight outcome, but I know that across our customer base and internally nobody is planning on that. So, we continue to expect a tight freight market with similar kind of pricing dynamics and fundaments at least for the remainder of the year and heading into next year.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. A number of analysts asked about Global Forwarding operating margins. Your results in Global Forwarding show a solid improvement in the second quarter relative to your first quarter results. Can you provide a path to more normalized operating leverage in Global Forwarding? Is it simply scale, or productivity initiatives, or a combination of the two?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. And Bob did a great job of explaining the sequential improvement that the team performed. And so, I won't go into that, but if you take an historical view, we decided in 2016 to go into segment reporting to really give our investors a clearer view of our different reportable segments. And so, given that, our \u2013 if you look at Global Forwarding of those last three-and-a-half years, the operating income as a percent of net revenue has kind of varied between on the low side 18%, on the high side 22% on average. And so, if you look at that 20.7% for the Q2 of this year, it's really within that band.","Included in those numbers, because we acquired first, obviously, Phoenix, secondly APC, and thirdly Milgram, there is a lot of non-cash amortization in those figures. So, when you add that back in, and it's roughly 6% to 7% on the operating income line, it's the 27%, 28% as a percent of that revenue. And so, while that team does have continued strides to make, and they will, we do believe that those margins are reflective of a really nice and a really strong Global Forwarding operation.","Secondly on that, if you think about the growth that that organization has had, if you go back to Q2 of 2016, so just two years ago, our net revenue was up nearly 50% on a quarter-over-quarter basis in that regard. So, we are growing scale. We are growing organically with some of our additional services. So, we do believe there continues to be opportunities for significant operating margin leverage as we continue to grow.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for Bob is from Jack Atkins of Stephens on Robinson Fresh. Todd Fowler of KeyBanc and Fadi Chamoun of BMO asked similar questions. Robinson Fresh results were negatively impacted by the adverse insurance claim. But can you speak to what is driving the top line in net revenue margin pressure at Fresh? I would have thought that the segment would see improved net revenue trends after being able to reprice its customer contracts in the first half.","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks. So, Robinson Fresh is a unique business within Robinson. And while we report both the produce sourcing and transportation revenues separately within the business, they're really closely linked. And at times I think it's difficult to interpret how the results of one impact the other. In many ways our Robinson Fresh product business is experiencing many of the same challenges today that many manufacturing and other food companies are experiencing in this rising freight environment.","Our produce business is working to forecast the delivered sale of a product to either retailer or a food service provider at a fixed price into the future. And when the cost of transportation rises beyond that forecast, both the profitability and demand can tend to be impacted. So, across many of the commodities that we sell, demand for our case sales is really driven by the demand for promotions at retail. So, if you think about that supermarket flier that advertises grapes for $0.99 a pound versus $1.99 per pound, consumers are going to tend to buy more when they're $0.99. So, promotions drive consumption in our business, and that ultimately drives demand. When freight costs escalate, promotional prices escalate, and demand goes down. And this has a really negative impact on our overall volume of cases sold. According to IRI, in second quarter, product sold strictly on promotion at retail during Q2 was down about 420 basis points versus Q2 of last year. Additionally, a portion of the freight volume of Robinson Fresh is tied to the sale of that produce, so much of that is priced in advance and it's difficult to reprice that freight, as we're not just repricing the freight component, but ultimately the delivered price of that product. So, in a rapidly rising cost environment we do see potential in the Robinson Fresh business for margin compression on both the freight side and potentially decreased demand on the product side within RF.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. The next question is also for Bob regarding NAST EBIT margins and comes from Ben Hartford of R.W. Baird. Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer and Tom Wadewitz of UBS also asked about NAST EBIT margins. NAST results were strong during the second quarter, but segment EBIT margins as a percent of net revenue remain below second quarter 2015 and second quarter 2016 levels. Can NAST further improve EBIT margins from Q2 2018 levels and return to recent historical highs? And if so, what is the pathway to doing so?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","I don't think that we're at the peak of our EBIT margins as a percentage of net revenue. How we improve those margins is really under a constant state of evaluation and fine-tuning from the leadership of NAST. The four long \u2013 mid to long-term goals of NAST around effectively leveraging our data differently, expanding our core services, enhancing our customer experience, and driving the reinvention of the model are all really geared towards driving additional efficiency and effectiveness of NAST. So, we've spoken on this call and in the past about how we're optimizing our network footprint, and this is an important piece of the future success, but really, I think about our success in NAST being driven not only by where work gets done, but also how work gets done. So, we've seen uplift and gaining scale from evolving our footprint, centralizing some task-oriented work, and building out more scaled centers of excellence. But really the real opportunity for us is around the ongoing re-engineering of how work gets done, how we leverage our artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced analytics even more effectively to evolve our workflows and eliminate steps within our processes. So, we continue to be focused on maintaining the flat head count within NAST as we continue to add more commercially-facing roles and engineer out task-oriented work. Our IT teams, our engineers, and our business leaders are really active and thinking differently about how we get work done and how we positively impact that EBIT margin.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. Next question for Andy from Matt Reustle of Goldman Sachs. Please provide monthly net revenue trends during the second quarter? Additionally, while net revenue per business day growth moderates in the back half of the year, can you still show an acceleration in operating income growth?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Our monthly net revenue growth per day in 2018 was 15% in April, 14% in May, and 23% in June. And now I'm going to give you the comparison. As you all recall, this time last year we talked about how challenging Q2 of 2017 was, and April of 2017 was down 3%, May of 2017 was down 5%, and June of 2017 was down 3%. So, hopefully that will give you a little better historical perspective on the monthly net revenue per day. As to the latter part of the question, clearly, I think we and the team did a great job on a year-over-year basis of driving 20% operating income growth, but also sequentially in the second quarter we grew operating income nearly $30 million, which is reflective of what we've seen in previous periods. We have, as Bob was mentioning on head count, doing a really nice job of making investments that are driving productivity, driving better statistics in that regard. I think across that board you've seen our SG&A pretty much level out, and the only thing that would impact that one way or the other would be issues like allowance for doubtful accounts or continued auto liability claims, which would change that number one way or the other. So, as we continue to drive strong net revenue growth, we do believe that that will translate into operating income growth as well.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bob, you've been in the COO role for more than a quarter now. What's been your focus during your first few months on the job and what opportunities do you see to improve productivity in the coming quarters? Based on your vision for the company, how will Robinson look different in two to three years compared to today?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Well, thanks for the question there, Bascome. I guess I'll take you on a quick tour over the last few months, as I've been in this role since the end of February and beginning of March. So, in terms of where I've been spending time, I'd say first and foremost I've been focused on continuing to provide guidance to our strong team of NAST leaders as we continue down that path of NAST reinvention. I've spent a couple weeks in Europe with our Surface Transportation and Global Forwarding teams looking and discussing ways that we can drive greater synergies between our North American and European businesses. I've been working closely with our IT organization to determine succession for Chad Lindbloom's retirement. And really been balancing the rest of my time between Robinson Fresh, maintenance services, the broader Global Forwarding team, as well as working with our commercial team as we continue to think about refining our go-to-market strategy to drive growth and serve those 120,000 customers.","I'm really fortunate that I've inherited a really strong team on all levels on a global basis. One output that I wanted to share from the first few months is that we're really excited about the fact that we have named a new Chief Technology Officer in Mike Neill. Mike's been with Robinson for about 15 years, and he's a really strong software engineer and a great leader of people. So, Mike's been at the core of building out our product roadmaps, our infrastructure, as well as our architecture, and I'm really confident in his vision for the future of the Navisphere platform. Mike will be a great add to our overall executive leadership team, and we'll continue to add talent to help support Mike and accelerate the speed of development and deployment of software.","Across other parts of the business, we've established and reaffirmed our mid- to long-term growth plans, and we've identified several opportunities to drive both top and bottom line growth. In terms of the future and my vision, I believe that we're really going to continue to be a people, process and technology-oriented company. But our investments in each of those areas are going to continue to evolve and shift in the coming years. As I think about Robinson, and our proud history, and our future, I really think about it in terms of three chapters. And it's this incredible story of excellence, evolution and transformation. The first chapter of Robinson really defined our entrepreneurial spirit, and it closely mirrored the history of transportation, from the first refrigerated truck in 1939, to the interstate highway system beginning in 1945, to deregulation. Each of these changes brought new ideas, new ways to serve our customers and suppliers. And throughout all of it, we were there taking a leadership position.","Our next chapter that went really from becoming a publicly traded company in 1997 to the beginning of our global expansion in Europe, and South America, and Asia, and the launch of Navisphere, our global technology platform, that was really about establishing our evolution and further strengthening our culture and our global reach.","Today we're living and writing that next chapter of transformation, and we truly have the opportunity to shift and capitalize in this digital economy. We're clearly in the most competitive and dynamic environment in our history, and we don't believe that change will ever be slower than it is today. So, we've got this incredible opportunity in front of us on a global basis to enhance the way that we create and deliver value to our customers, our carriers, and our shareholders by leveraging new ways of thinking, new ways of acting, and creating value. So, we're going to double down on our commitment to both top and bottom line growth, as Andy said, and serving our customers in new and innovative ways. While I can't project exactly to Bascome's question, what C.H. Robinson will look like in three years? What I can commit to is that we're going to continue to be focused on customer centricity, expanding our advantage in technology, and leading in the areas of advanced analytics, artificial intelligence to improve our customer and carrier experiences.","So, our growth in the future is going to continue to be fueled by a mix of organic as well as strategic acquisitions that add to our geographic footprint or add or enhance services within our portfolio. So, we're going to continue to lead by having the most capable and committed staff of supply chain experts in the industry. And I do believe that this is a people-oriented business, and we're going to keep investing in great people.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. The next question is for John. Several analysts asked how much of your contract book of business has repriced this year? Is this the point in the cycle where you would begin to favor volume over price consistent with your long-term strategy to drive market share gains?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Our historic metric that we've shared around our committed business is that more of it reprices in the first half of the year, generally two-thirds and one-third in the latter half of the year. Also, in our prepared comments, we shared that a substantial portion or likely more than half of it has repriced and is more reflective of kind of the current market conditions. I think that guidance is still probably about right. That we've got a significant portion, maybe two-thirds of it repriced. But there clearly is still more work to do. Bob referenced some of the fresh activity, and there is still a lot of activity in the network around account management and activities that continue to require analysis and adjustment to the market.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill and Jason Seidl from Cowen & Company asked about personnel expense. Andy, personnel costs ramped up in Q2, rising 120 basis points year-over-year. Is there any catch-up in incentive comp in the second quarter results? If so, should we see a sequential deceleration in Q3 in personnel costs?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","I think, we've talked often and at length about our incentive compensation. And it's important to our values and our culture. And as we've often talked, it aligns our incentives with that of our shareholders. So, specifically, we accrue those expenses on a quarterly and year-to-date basis. So, in periods where you see performance accelerating like we did in Q2 of this year, you would see there be a slight amount of catch-up Q1 versus Q2. And, conversely, we experienced the opposite last year as our performance in Q2 of 2017 decelerated, and there was a bit of a takeback in from what we had in Q1. Nothing that we would consider or investor would consider material. One of the things that I'd like to point out is despite the fact that we saw a sequential increase in our Q1 to Q2 compensation, as we talked about it was only 4% head count growth and that was driven in large part by the Milgram acquisition. The amount of that compensation that was fixed quarter-to-quarter actually decreased, so, there was more variable compensation, based on our performance, in Q2 of this year versus Q1, and we think that's reflective of our values, of our culture and in alignment with our shareholders.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. The next question for Bob comes from Fadi Chamoun of BMO. The current trucking market is proving exceptionally tighter compared to recent history. Does it change how you think about your exposure mix of spot versus contractual freight?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So, about 20 years ago in truckload we made a really conscious decision as part of our strategy that as a 3PL we wanted to participate in much more than just the spot market that brokers were traditionally focused on. And at that time and today we really believe that our ability to participate with our customers in their overall transportation spend is an important ingredient to our success. And so, today we're really able to wear two hats for the same customer, one that looks and feels much more like a dedicated fixed-asset-committed carrier, and one that's much more flexible and allows shippers really efficient access to the spot market when routing guides and plans fail. So, when markets stabilize, we tend to see a higher percentage of our business lean towards contractual, and when markets are changing rapidly, we tend to see our business lean more towards transactional. The mix between contractual and transactional is not necessarily a conscious choice or a decision that we make, it's much more of a by-product of the overall marketplace and the decisions that our customers make on how they choose to engage us. Over time, our goal is to continue to grow volume at a rate ahead of overall marketplace growth, and that growth will become \u2013 will come both from contractual as well as spot market freight.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. Chris Wetherbee of Citi asked the next question for John on the competitive landscape. Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley and Todd Fowler of KeyBanc also asked about competition. Can you provide an update on the competitive landscape in truckload brokerage? And are newer tech-based competitors more active and are you seeing any impact to pricing?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","One of the things that remains most true is that our industry is incredibly fragmented. There still are more than 10,000 members of a TIA association, there's more than 100,000 motor carriers and while we know that we're substantially larger than anybody else, we know that we can't move pricing and that we don't have the sort of clout to impact things. So, the answer is no. We don't really see any specific start-ups or the evolution of the competitive landscape causing a measurable impact on pricing. Obviously, in this current environment, the cyclical impact is trumping any kind of secular changes around digital transformation or how the competitive landscape might be evolving. Now, all that is not to dismiss, Bob shared, in a lot of ways we're big believers in some of the new tools that are coming to the market and I know that there is a better-than-ever menu of competitors who are working on mobile apps and location services, but we think our Navisphere platform is really at a different scale and a competitive differentiator, and we're going to keep investing in it to make sure we stay ahead in that competitive landscape. So, lots of change. It's more competitive than ever, but it's as fragmented as it has always been, and therefore, it's really not likely to see measurable impact from one or a handful of new entrants.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Todd Fowler of KeyBanc asked about Milgram. Andy, please provide an update on the Milgram integration. Are there duplicative costs associated with integration during the quarter? And if so, can you quantify? At what point will the integration be complete?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah, we're pleased with the integration efforts on behalf of all of our teams, starting with APC in 2016 and most recently Milgram in 2017. And I would offer that they've done a great job of integrating those organizations into the overall Global Forwarding platform, which has driven, as I referenced earlier, significant both operating income as well as net revenue growth. There are a few duplicative costs that are still there, nothing that's material. We've done a great job of integrating the agents into our organization and you've seen a tremendous updraft in some of the performance there. I would say that as we get into the latter part of this year and go into 2018, when we finally put Milgram onto the Navisphere platform, you'll see a few more synergies picked up just in terms of our overall efficiency and performance there.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question is for John from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. How much of an impact is the ELD regulation having on supply in your view?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","You know, it's interesting. Prior to the ELD implementation, a lot of projection and speculation around what impact it would have was thinking about what, if any, percentage of trucks might exit the market or not renew their registration and whether 2%, 3%, 5% of capacity would leave the marketplace as a result of the requirement. As we've shared, we haven't really seen any of that. We continue to have very healthy signup of new capacity and we really anecdotally don't know of much meaningful capacity leaving the marketplace. I think the other impact, which has been meaningful, that we've shared in a variety of ways is that the pricing and the uncertainty that has come with those tweener lanes and the repositioning of networks and how a lot of the capacity has changed their behavior around what freight is preferable and how they are pricing, especially certain corridors or certain types of freight like the Fresh division that was reference. So, there's definitely been a meaningful impact because of the types of ways that it's changed. It's really hard to quantify and know what it is, but clearly a contributor to part of the current cycle and the tight side of the supply.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. The next question is also for John from Matt Reustle of Goldman Sachs. Are you seeing your customers act differently than in previous cycles? Are contract terms changing in any way?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","I think, the overall answer to that is no. When you think about the current environment, it's been a while since we've had this kind of route-guide deterioration and price inflation in the supply chain. So, whenever we have an escalation of costs like this, it puts a lot of pressure on all of us in the industry, and especially on a lot of the shippers. So, we're definitely seeing with this type of price increase the aversion to the spot market, the refocus on contractual compliance, to committed relationships, all of those things with greater emphasis, just like we would have seen in this portion of cycle in the past. So, maybe a renewed spirit of emphasis and kind of some new reactions compared to the last five, six years, but overall, probably a predictable reaction and adjustment to this part of the cycle.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks. The next question is from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Andy, what was the year-over-year impact of changes in fuel surcharges on net revenue margins in the first and second quarters?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah, and recall that fuel is a cosmetic impact to our net revenue margins. In Q1 of this year it had a drag of 40 basis points on our net revenue margins and in Q2, given the increase in fuel, it had a drag of 55 basis points on the net revenue margin percentage.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Now to Bob. Jason Seidl also asked is the improvement in July truckload volume decline a function of easier comps, more favorable direct results at C.H. Robinson, or a combination?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","It's really a function of both. Looking back at 2017, we had much stronger volume growth in the front half of the year than we did in the back half of the year with fourth quarter last year even being negative in terms of volume growth. If we look at the first seven months of 2018, we see sequential improvement in total volume on a per-day basis every month. So, while July volume is up on a per-day basis sequentially compared to June, we do have easier comps on a year-over-year basis in the second half of the year.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. Another question for Bob from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. With truck orders that remain elevated, do you anticipate capacity coming online in any meaningful way?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","We mentioned in our prepared remarks that we continue to add new carriers to our network at an accelerating rate, but we don't necessarily see this as meaningful new capacity coming into the overall North American network. As much as it is likely company drivers or lease drivers that expanding out on their own to start businesses and act as owner-operators, if you think about the carriers that we added last quarter, the average fleet size of those carriers that we onboarded is right around 1.5 trucks per fleet. So, these are truly owner-operators that are either new to the industry, new to Robinson, or both. So, given the driver shortage that all the mid-sized and larger trucking companies that I talk to report, and the challenges of recruiting and retaining drivers in an environment of nearly full employment, I don't see a meaningful increase in overall capacity entering the market.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. Our last question is for Andy from Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill. What are your thoughts on debt paydown? Now that you have $1.4 billion in debt, would you look to pay down the AR securitization and credit facility or would you look to increase your debt exposure to keep leverage just below two times debt to EBITDA?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","One of the things that we continue to be proud of is the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to access capital in a meaningful way, as evidenced earlier this year when we took down $600 million of investment-grade debt. If you think about the rates that we're paying on our credit facility at just under 3.3% and the AR securitization at 2.9%, we wouldn't envision paying those down, just given the relatively lower rates at which we borrow. Our comfort level, and we've talked about this, is at between 1 and 1.5 times net debt to EBITDA, absent any other strategic opportunity that came our way.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","That concludes the Q&A portion of today's earning call. A replay of today's call will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com at approximately 11:30 AM Eastern time today.

Following today's presentation, Bob Houghton will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, January 30, 2019.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Bob Houghton, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Robert Houghton","Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Andy Clarke, Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Biesterfeld, Chief Operating Officer. John, Andy, and Bob will provide commentary on our 2018 fourth quarter and full-year results. Presentation slides that accompany their remarks can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com. We will follow that with responses to the pre-submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday.","I'd like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.","And with that, I will turn the call over to John.","John Wiehoff","Thank you, Bob, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. In my opening remarks, I want to highlight some of the headline themes that we'll be discussing with you today.","Strength of our business model is the ability to rebalance our portfolio between contractual and spot market freight as market conditions change. In periods of market dislocation we experience higher levels of repricing activity across our portfolio. Then as routing guides perform more effectively and freight costs decelerate, we tend to see our volumes shift more heavily towards contractual business accompanied by net revenue growth and margin expansion. This outcome is clearly reflected in our fourth quarter results.","Over an extended freight cycle, we continue to believe that honoring our commitments on contractual freight while also securing spot market capacity is the best way to serve our network of customers and carriers, grow our business, and create value for shareholders. With fluctuating levels of freight demand and carrier supply, significant weather events, and changes in tariff activity and government regulations, the last few years have marked a period of high volatility in the freight market.","A critical part of our strategy is to make investments that add value for our customers and carriers, and drive growth for our business regardless of where we are in the freight cycle. We are proud of the strong financial results we delivered in the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 and believe that they are a reflection of our strategy of true cycle investments.","Our North American Surface Transportation business did an excellent job of supporting our customers and carriers through a volatile freight market and delivered outstanding results for the year. Our Global Forwarding business delivered strong net revenue growth through a combination of volume increases and pricing adjustments that reflect market conditions while also making investments to drive future growth. Our Robinson Fresh business delivered significantly improved results in the second half of the year and finished the year with net revenue growth and operating margin expansion.","With those introductory comments, I'll turn it over to Andy to review our financial statements.","Andrew Clarke","Thank you, John and good morning everyone. I'd like to begin my comments on the financial results by highlighting the fact that Robinson achieved record results across the board. Gross revenues, net revenues, and operating income for both the quarter and the full year were at all-time highs. All three of our reportable segments contributed to the success by growing both net revenues and operating income at a double-digit rate in the fourth quarter. Each segment expanded operating margin significantly in the quarter as well.","From a cash flow perspective, we knocked it out of the park generating over $700 million in free cash flow and returning nearly $600 million to our shareholders during the year. Our enterprise platform has been carefully and thoughtfully constructed over many years for both scale and leverage through all types of environments and cycles. We are appropriately proud of this performance.","Now, on to Slide 4 and our financial results. Fourth quarter total revenues increased 4.5% to $4.1 billion driven by higher pricing across most transportation service lines. Volume growth in LTL, ocean, and customs and higher fuel cost. Total company net revenues increased $82 million or 13% in the quarter to $714 million. Net revenue growth was led by truckload services up $53 million and LTL services up $12 million.","We delivered double-digit net revenue growth in ocean, air, and customs for a combined increase of $15 million in the quarter. Fourth quarter monthly net revenue per business day was up 10%, 11%, and 13% respectively in October, November, and December. Total operating expenses increased $37 million an 8.9% increase versus the prior year period. Personnel expenses increased 8.9% primarily as a result of increases in our performance based compensation that aligns the interest of our employees with our shareholders.","Total company average headcount increased slightly in the quarter and slowed sequentially from the 2.6% growth in the third quarter. The fourth quarter included headcount reductions in both Global Forwarding and Robinson Fresh. SG&A expenses were up 8.8% in the quarter to $119 million. The primary drivers were increases in outside professional services, occupancy, and travel and entertainment costs.","Total operating income was a record $256 million in the fourth quarter, up 21.2% over last year. Operating margin expanded 240 basis points versus last year and 40 basis points sequentially to 35.8%. Our teams did an excellent job of achieving operating margin leverage in the quarter and the year. This has been and will remain a top priority for our organization. Fourth quarter net income was $187 million, an increase of 22.7%. Our diluted earnings per share was $1.34 in the fourth quarter up from $1.08 last year.","Slide 5 covers other income statement items. The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 23.9%, up from 21.1% last year. Recall that the year ago period included one-time tax benefits totaling $31.8 million. For the full year our tax rate was 24.5% and we expect our effective tax rate to be between 24% and 25% again in 2019. As noted throughout the year, we adopted the new accounting standards update for revenue recognition in the first quarter of 2018.","As a result, in-transit shipments are now included in our financial results. This policy did not have a material impact on our overall operating results for the year. However, it did significantly decrease gross revenues in our Robinson Fresh sourcing business including a $37 million reduction in the fourth quarter of this year.","For the full year, sourcing gross revenues were negatively impacted by $121 million. Fourth quarter interest and other expense totaled $9.5 million, down from $17.5 million last year. Every quarter we are required to revalue our U.S. dollar working capital and cash balances against the functional currency in each country where we conduct business and hold U.S. dollars. The resulting gain or loss is reflected on the income statement.","The U.S. dollar strengthened against several of our key currencies this quarter resulting in a $2.4 million gain from currency revaluation. Movements in currency valuations will continue to have an impact on our quarterly net income and we will continue to break out this impact in future quarters. The gain in currency valuation was partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher interest rates, while our overall debt balance was down. Our share count in the quarter was down just over 1% as share repurchases were partially offset by the impact of activity in our equity compensation plans.","Turning to Slide 6, we had another strong quarter of cash generation. Cash flow from operations totaled $264 million in the quarter, up 59% versus last year. For the full year, cash flow from operations increased nearly 107% to $793 million. A combination of increased earnings and improved working capital performance drove the fourth quarter and full year improvement. Capital expenditures totaled $14.3 million for the quarter and $63.9 million for the year. In 2019 we expect capital expenditures to be between $80 million and $90 million. The increased spending will be primarily dedicated to technology.","Our capital distribution is summarized on Slide 7. We've returned $168 million to shareholders in the quarter through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, a 42% increase versus the prior year period. For the full year we returned $590 million to shareholders, a 28% increase.","In 2019 we will continue to evaluate and deploy our capital to add value to our network of customers and carriers and generate returns for our employees and shareholders. We will look to acquire quality companies that fit our strategies, business model and culture, and we will continue to reward our shareholders through buybacks and dividends.","Now, on to the balance sheet on Slide 8. Working capital increased 12% versus the prior year period, driven by higher gross revenues and the resulting increase in accounts receivables. The contract assets and accrued transportation expense lines on the balance sheet primarily reflect in-transit activity in accordance with the adoption of revenue recognition.","Our debt balance at the quarter was $1.35 billion. Across our credit facility, private placement debt, accounts receivable securitization and senior notes, our weighted average interest rate was 4% in the quarter.","Slide 9 captures our full-year financial performance. We delivered double-digit growth in net revenues and operating income and a 100 basis point improvement in operating margin. Strong operating profit performance combined with improved working capital and the benefits of corporate tax reform drove a 32.5% increase in our earnings per share. Once again it bears mentioning, 2018 net revenues, operating income, earnings per share, and cash flow from operations all represent record levels of performance for C.H. Robinson.","I'd like to congratulate all of our teams across the globe on your outstanding performance in 2018. Our great results this year reflect our focus on profitable growth and our vigorous efforts to grow our business while maintaining strong operational excellence.","I'll wrap up my comments this morning with a look at our current trends. Our consistent practice is to share the per business day comparison of net revenues and volume. January 2019 global net revenues per business day have increased approximately 9% and North American truckload volumes have increased approximately 3%.","As we look ahead to the balance of the first quarter, we wanted to highlight an item from our 2018 first quarter results. Driven by the tight truckload market last year we saw sequential acceleration in our net revenue growth during the first quarter of 2018. Last year net revenue per business day increased 7%, 12%, and 12% respectively in January, February, and March. Additionally, the 2019 first quarter has one last business day versus the first quarter of 2018.","Thank you all for joining us this morning. We appreciate you all listening. I will now turn it over to Bob to provide additional context on our segment performance.","Robert Biesterfeld, Jr.","Thanks Andy, and good morning everyone. I'll begin my remarks this morning on our operating segment performance by highlighting the rapidly changing nature of the logistics market. On Slide 11, the light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in North America truckload rate per mile billed to our customers and cost per mile paid to our contract carriers net of fuel costs since 2008. As a reminder, North America truckload includes both NAST and Robinson Fresh truckload.","The grey line represents our net revenue margin for all transportation services. The rate of growth in North America truckload price per mile and cost per mile continued to moderate this quarter including a modest decline in truckload cost per mile versus the prior year. We benefited from the shift towards contractual volume in a decelerating cost environment in the fourth quarter leading to 110 basis point sequential improvement in transportation net revenue margin from the third quarter.","Our net revenue margin expands and contracts with changes in the freight cycle tending to expand when costs moderate. Despite the high level of rate and cost volatility, as well as other secular market factors, our average net revenue margin has remained relatively consistent over time.","One of the metrics we use to measure market conditions is the truckload routing guide depth from our Managed Services business which represents roughly $4 billion dollars in freight under management. In the fourth quarter, the average routing guide depth of tender was 1.4 representing that on average the first or second carrier in a shipper's routing guide was executing the shipment in most cases. This representation of routing guide performance is reflective of a more balanced market.","Moving to Slide 12, this graph shows North America truckload average price per mile billed to customers and cost per mile paid to our carriers net of fuel since 2010 and represents the underlying data from the previous slide. We've excluded the actual price per mile and cost per mile scale to protect our proprietary data.","The absolute price per mile and cost per mile moderated versus last quarter. However, both metrics remain well above levels we've seen over much of the current decade. While the Managed Services routing guide depth of 1.4 reflects a more balanced market, it appears that in general routing guides have reset at higher pricing and are functioning more effectively.","This chart also shows that since 2010 we've continued to adjust our pricing in response to changes in marketplace conditions. We have generally maintained a consistent spread between price and cost even in periods of high volatility in the freight market. On average both customer pricing and carrier costs have increased roughly 3% annually over this time period.","Turning to Slide 13 and our North America Surface Transportation business, fourth quarter NAST net revenues increased 13.5% to $471 million, led by double-digit growth in our truckload, less than truckload, and intermodal services. A combination of higher contractual prices and moderating freight costs in the fourth quarter drove the 110 basis point expansion in net revenue margin despite a roughly 35 basis point headwind from higher fuel costs. Led by higher pricing, our truckload net revenues increased 13% to $344 million in the quarter.","The successful repricing of our contractual business during 2018 has rebalanced our portfolio leading towards more contractual freight with an approximate mix of 65% contractual and 35% transactional volume in the fourth quarter versus a 50-50 mix in the year ago period. NAST truckload volume declined modestly in the quarter down 1.5% as our repricing activity led to roughly 45% reduction in our negative loads associated with contractual shipments and returned our negative load percentage to a more typical level.","We continue to add new carriers to our network, driving continued expansion of the largest fleet of motor carriers in North America while simultaneously brining new capacity solutions to life for our customers. We added roughly 4,800 new carriers in the fourth quarter which is a 30% increase over last year's fourth quarter.","Our less than truck load business delivered another quarter of great performance with net revenues increasing 11.5% to $112 million. This represents our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit net revenue growth. We delivered a high single-digit increase in pricing driven by the continued expansion of pricing tools that enable us to react faster to changes in the LTL. LTL volumes increased 2% in the quarter driven by continued growth in manufacturing and e-commerce. Through our common carrier services offerings and our consolidation of products, we continue to gain scale and market share in the LTL segment.","In our intermodal business fourth quarter net revenues increased 76.4% versus the year ago period which included elevated repositioning charges. We remain committed to our intermodal business as it enables us to offer our customers the most comprehensive service line offerings in the logistics industry.","Slide 14 outlines our NAST operating income performance. Fourth quarter operating income increased 16.9% to $211 million. Operating margin of 44.8% improved 130 basis points led by net revenue growth. This strong performance includes the impact of higher variable compensation expenses. Our fourth quarter operating margin also improved 90 basis points sequentially.","Our fourth quarter results reflect the benefits of our continued investments in technology. We are leveraging advanced algorithms and the scale of our data advantage to further improve our ability to profitably match shipper demand and carrier supply across our network. We are also driving productivity improvements to automate interactions with our customers and our carriers and improve our internal workflows. These investments enabled us to deliver growth in both net revenues and expand our operating margin in the fourth quarter.","For the full year, our NAST business delivered outstanding performance. Net revenues increased 17.3% including double-digit growth in our truckload, LTL and intermodal service lines despite headcount that grew less than half a percent. Operating margin expanded 210 basis points including the impact of increased variable compensation expense driven by our strong performance. In 2019 we plan to accelerate our digital transformation efforts and technology investments to make our processes even more efficient and our employees even more productive, while continuing to deliver more benefits to our network of customers and carriers.","Turning to Slide 15 and our Global Forwarding business, fourth quarter Global Forwarding net revenues increased 11.6% to $143 million. We lapped our acquisition of Milgram & Company in Canada in the third quarter, so our fourth quarter net revenue performance reflects pure organic growth from a comparability standpoint. In our ocean service line we returned to net revenue growth as expected, driven by a combination of pricing reflective of the current market conditions and a robust sales pipeline.","Ocean net revenues increased 12.4% in the quarter including a 7.5% increase in shipment volumes. Fourth quarter air net revenues increased 9.3% as a shift in customer mix was partially offset by a 3% decline in shipments. Customs net revenues increased 12.4% in the quarter while transactions increased approximately 4.5% in the fourth quarter as we continue to expand our customs presence around the world.","In our conversations with carriers and global shippers, companies continue to plan for tariff activity and potential implications to the redesign of global supply chains. Our Global Forwarding business is actively engaged with customers to help them understand and quantify the impacts of both the enacted and potential future tariffs. The current set of tariffs in place has not had a significant impact on our Global Forwarding financial results.","Given our broad portfolio of service offerings and our strong presence in key markets, such as Southeast Asia and India we believe we are well positioned to help our customers continue to win in an ever changing global trade environment.","Slide 16 outlines our Global Forwarding operating income performance. Fourth quarter operating income increased 76.9% to $30 million. Operating margin of 20.9% increased 770 basis points versus last year, but by higher net revenues and a modest decline in headcount. For the full-year we are pleased with the top line growth of our Global Forwarding business. We grew volume in our ocean, air, and customs service lines and generated double-digit growth in Global Forwarding net revenues.","Looking forward, we continue to see significant opportunities to drive scale and geographic reach in this segment. At the same time we've realized that we have opportunities to drive even greater efficiency as we grow this business. So we're focused on operating margin expansion through additional technology deployment and intelligent process automation. Over the long-term we remain confident that we will deliver operating margin performance consistent with other leading companies in the Global Forwarding segment.","Transitioning to Slide 17 and our Robinson Fresh segment, sourcing net revenues were $25 million down 8.2% from last year. Case volumes declined 6.5% driven by a combination of lower levels of promotional activity at our retail customers and lower restaurant traffic at our foodservice customers. The revenue recognition policy change negatively impacted sourcing total revenues by approximately $37 million in the quarter. There was no impact to net revenue.","Transportation net revenues grew 45.9% to over $39 million led by a double-digit increase in truckload. The improvements in Robinson Fresh transportation results are directly related to the repricing activities that took place throughout 2018.","Slide 18 outlines our Robinson Fresh operating income performance. Fourth quarter operating income grew by 53.5% to nearly $20 million. Operating margin of 30.8% improved 700 basis points led by higher net revenues in the transportation business and a 5% reduction in headcount. Through a combination of pricing reflective of market conditions, operating expense controls, and investments to improve operational efficiency, our Robinson Fresh team generated improved results in the second half of 2018 and for the full year delivered both growth in net revenues and operating income along with 190 basis points of operating margin expansion.","Moving to our All Other and corporate businesses on Slide 19, as a reminder All Other includes our Managed Services business, Surface Transportation outside of North America, other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses. Managed Services net revenues increased 10.9% to $20 million in the quarter driven by a combination of selling additional services to our existing customers and new customer wins.","Freight under management increased 2% in the quarter to over $1.3 billion, and freight under management for the full year increased 9% to plus $4 billion. Customers continue to value our transportation management system offering which allows them to manage their carrier selection process and complex supply chains without the required fixed investment in people or technology.","Our sales pipeline in the Managed Services business remains very robust and we expect continued growth in this business in 2019. Other surface transportation net revenues declined 7.3% in the quarter to $15 million, as pricing declines were partially offset by a mid-single-digit increase in volume. We have a very strong pipeline of new business in our Europe Surface Transportation.","Before I turn the call back to John for some final comments, I'll take a minute to wrap up the section on our operating performance. Our outstanding results reflect our continued ability to help our network of customers and carriers, navigate a rapidly changing freight market and provide solutions that accelerate commerce in their businesses.","In both the fourth quarter and the full year we delivered strong growth in net revenues and expansion in both net revenue margin and operating margin. We also significantly increased our cash from operations and cash return to shareholders. I am very pleased with our fourth quarter and our full-year financial results.","As we turn to 2019 we remain committed to our operating plans that we've been implementing across our businesses. We will continue to leverage our comprehensive offering of services and capabilities to deliver logistics expertise to our customers and carriers and we will accelerate our digital transformation with investments in technology to deliver actionable intelligence and supply chain capabilities to the over 200,000 companies that conduct business on our global platform. I remain confident that we'll continue to deliver industry-leading capabilities for our customers and our carriers, to provide more rewarding career opportunities for our employees, and to generate strong returns to our shareholders.","Thank you for listening this morning and at this point I'll turn the call back to John.","John Wiehoff","Thank you, Bob. I am going to wrap up our prepared remarks with a few final comments. Let me start by sharing a few data points on what we are seeing currently in the marketplace. As stated, we do see evidence of a more balanced freight market. Routing guide depths are now more consistent with a balanced freight market and our truckload shipments have moved back to our typical more contractually weighted mix. The significant price increases of 2018 have moderated and while it is uncertain what the remainder of 2019 will bring, we are in a more balanced situation today.","Tariffs and changes in global trade agreements remain a big uncertainty for many of our customers. We do believe there were modest amounts of advanced shipping and inventory buildup in 2018. The U.S. economy continues to grow and our customers are generally planning for steady to increased freight volumes. While our markets are more balanced at the moment, the potential for further changes remains high.","Our core go-to-market strategy has always been to help our customers understand and adapt to the market conditions. We focus on managing through the cyclical changes in the market while investing in our capabilities for the future. 2018 was a year of excellent financial performance for Robinson.","We generated record levels of revenues and operating income, earnings per share and cash from operations. But more importantly, we continue to invest in our people, processes, and technology for the future. Our team, our culture and our platform are real competitive advantages that are getting stronger every day. We feel great about our future and our continuing ability to create value for all of our stakeholders.","That concludes our prepared comments and with that I'll turn it back to the operator so that we can answer the submitted questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Houghton the floor is now yours for the question-and-answer session.","Robert Houghton","Thank you, Donna. First, I would like to thank the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions after our earnings release yesterday. For today's Q&A session, I will frame up the question and then turn it over to John, Andy or Bob for a response.","Our first question comes from several analysts. Bob, after a very strong 2018 year-over-year comparisons clearly get more challenging as we move through 2019. Can you speak to the levers that you intend to pull to help drive NAST net revenue growth in 2019 given evidence of a balanced freight market?","Robert Biesterfeld, Jr.","Yes, absolutely. So we're definitely feeling a more balanced market in 2019 when compared to the prior year. As we've stated in the past, we tend to look at net revenue dollars on a per load or per shipment basis as a more important internal metric than absolutely net revenue margin. So we know for the first half of 2018 our net revenue dollars per load were pretty close to our historical average and those really expanded throughout the second half of the year as cost started to moderate.","So for our success in 2019 is going to come from continuing to take market share through increasing truckload and LTL volumes on a year-over-year basis, as well as continuing to stay focused on our initiatives around cost control and driving further efficiency into our business model.","Volume growth will be key for us throughout the year, but even more so and in the second half. Fortunately for us, we've only got 3% market share today in NAST and we've got a really large and aggressive sales force that's committed to driving growth in 2019 by continuing to add value to our customers and carriers in these market conditions. Now I've said a lot of the past several years, but our focus is really not to go ditch to ditch between the focus on net revenue per load and load volume, but to continue to pursue that balanced growth strategy over the long term and throughout cycles.","Robert Houghton","Thanks Bob. The next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins","Andy, looking back to the last time we were in balanced market, 2016 and early 2017, your net operating margin peaked in the second quarter of 2016 and then declined pretty significantly over the next several quarters. Would you expect net revenue to grow faster than operating expenses in 2019?","Andrew Clarke","Thanks Jack for the question. The short answer is, our stated goal and objective is always to grow net revenue faster than operating expenses. That's at the enterprise level, but also at the divisional levels. When you when you reference a balanced market I know you're speaking specifically to the truckload market and let's go back and revisit that and the difference which by the way is truckload is 55% of our net revenue today and it's growing and it's great and we're very pleased with it. But in that market I would say that there were two differences primarily are different than today and the first is GDP was lower and the second is pricing and cost were lower.","So today and at that point it's pure arithmetic where the cost and the price lower today GDP is higher and the pricing and the costs are higher. So if you look at those lines we produced in the published report on our earnings that they're higher, that the relative difference hasn't really materially changed. And so, we think about those levers particularly with the NAST we think that continuing to grow net revenue in excess of our expenses is clearly achievable.","You then layer in some of the other services that we've added over the last five, six years, you think about LTL, you think about Global Forwarding, both of those businesses have doubled in that time. And in doing so, we've added more of a secular growth story to the Robinson enterprise and Robinson platform. And in doing that we've made investments and clearly as you saw in the fourth quarter a lot of those investments began to pay off. And so we're really pleased with those results and we do expect and it's our stated goal and it is how we're all compensated is to grow net revenues in excess of our operating expenses.","Robert Houghton","Thanks Andy. The next question is for John and is from Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Jack Atkins with Stephens asked a similar question.","Ben Hartford","What are 2019 contractual pricing growth expectations, have they softened from the low single digit outlook provided on the third quarter earnings call?","John Wiehoff","So in our committed biz in the low single digit comment was relevant to truckload, so I'm assuming that's where the question is at. But with regards to our contractual bidding, whenever you go through a period of time where there is meaningful change in the spot market, you're going to start to see some of that show up in the sentiment around the contracts and the committed rates. Over the months of December and January there have been some meaningful softening and reductions in some of the spot market and that will start to show up in the attitudes and the outcomes of the bids and the committed relationships.","I think low single digits is probably still a good center of gravity. Maybe a quarter ago people were saying low to mid single digits and that's more or what we were seeing, now more common low to flat, low single digits to flat, so some of the softening in the pricing is showing up in the committed activity. It's a pretty rapidly changing market. As we shared in our prepared comments there's a lot of different factors that are continuing to impact those bid arrangements and a lot of potential for change, but today probably the low single digits is still a good center of gravity in terms of expectations around committed pricing.","Robert Houghton","Thanks John. The next question is for Bob. Todd Fowler with KeyBanc asked.","Todd Fowler","With respect to the outlook commentary indicating that continued investments in technology will help achieve the 2019 objectives of top line growth and operating margin expansion, could you comment on how you see technology impacting 2019 and beyond? Are there costs associated with these investments that tail off in the future and if so how much?","Robert Biesterfeld, Jr.","Yes, thanks Todd. We expect that our CapEx run rate will increase to about $80 million to $90 million in 2019 and with that really our total expense related to IT investment for next year is planned to increase to well over $200 million. So while we're really proud of the foundation we've built within our Navisphere technology platform and our ability to provide customers and carriers with unrivaled and actionable intelligence about their businesses, the further investments that we're going to make in technology will really be focused on ensuring that we're providing best-in-class user centric technology.","We're providing technology that enables even more frictionless transactions, leveraging more effectively advanced analytics and data science and that doesn't just apply to truckload, but really applies across all of our services. We want to make sure that our e-team has the appropriate resources that they need to accelerate the speed to value so that they can take the great ideas from our people and from our customers and bring those to life even faster for our clients and create value for all of our stakeholders. So in terms of the step up in CapEx, I'd expect that to be pretty consistent for the next several years.","Robert Houghton","Thanks Bob. The next question is also for Bob from Chris Wetherbee of Citi.","Chris Wetherbee","Fourth quarter marked the second consecutive quarter of solid operating margin expansion. Can you help provide color on the broader trends in the cost structure? Is it being driven by more automated transactions and direct load matching? And are there other initiatives and what level do you think operating margins can move to over time?","Robert Biesterfeld, Jr.","I'm really bullish on our ability to both drive net revenue growth and operating margin expansion in the coming year as much as Andy said. Automating transactions and direct load matching are certainly part of the reason why operating margin has expanded and why we believe the opportunity to continue to expand operating margin, but it's really only part of the story. And the act of matching capacity to demand is really a small part of the overall Freightquote cash cycle that our clients ask us to manage for them and we're focused on creating value and reducing cost at each step of that cycle.","So we're investing in the area of direct load matching. We're also rolling out the tools that help us to accept the right freights based upon predictions of outcomes, more effectively manage exceptions, and we're leveraging tech in new ways across all of our reporting segments that remove the unnecessary steps out of our operational processes and we're investing in tech and process improvement to enhance our sales force, both the sales force effectiveness and the sales force efficiency as well as back office functions such as collections and billing, imaging and the like which has a positive impact.","Digital freight matching is clearly gaining most of the headlines today. We feel like we're in a great place in that space, but our focus is going to continue to be from Freightquote to cash and in simple a sense it's about winning more freight, executing at a lower cost and maintaining or improving our industry leading operating margins.","Robert Houghton","Thanks Bob The next question for Andy comes from Todd Fowler.","Todd Fowler","What\u2019s your view as normalized net operating margins for NAST and Global Forwarding, what factors within your control contribute to your ability to improve net operating margins over time?","Andrew Clarke","Yes, several years ago I made the decision to go to reportable segments and in doing so we broke out NAST and Global Forwarding and Robinson Fresh on their individual performances. Now we have four years of data for you all to lookout. And over that period of time I would break NAST and both Global Forwarding into two components and the first vote is net revenue. And NAST net revenue will be median net revenue margin percentage of NAST has been 16.4% over those last four years with a standard deviation [ph] of a 120 basis points and that includes the cosmetic impact of fuel, but also the substitution impact of LTL which tends to have a higher net revenue margin percentage.","And so, we would say that that net revenue margin has been relatively consistent and it's been in that mid double digits for a long period of time and we would expect it to continue to be in that. And so, then you go to \u2013 and to a large degree, there is a cyclical element of that as Bob mentioned earlier making a lot of investments on the IT and the business side to help us make smarter decisions, both for our customers on the pricing side, but also our carriers on the cost side. In doing so we think that we can continue to move the needle a bit on the net revenue margins.","On the operating margin side, again the same figures over the last four years. NAST operating margins, the median has been about 43.5%. And if you knock out the high highs and the high lows a standard deviation [ph] of that has been 160 basis points. And we talk about making investments in a through cycle environment. And so, fortunately for us we have the ability, as Bob mentioned earlier, to give our IT people the resources to make investments despite the fact there are periods of time if they go back to the net revenue number where in fact the net revenue has been below the median for a period of time, we're still making investments.","And as a result, you see the commensurate impact on the operating margin percentage. But the good news is, when we come out the other side, the operating margin expands. And so, to a large degree, that's where we're really focusing our efforts. And again as Bob and both Bob and John mentioned, we're going to continue to make those investments, we're going to continue to be more efficient and more effective as we go to market.","The Global Forwarding story is yet another interesting one. As I mentioned earlier, it's doubled in the last four or five years. We continue and have made significant investments in that part of our business and today it\u2019s continuing to grow and be an important part of our go-to-market with our customers. Their median net revenue margins have been 22.8%, again with a standard deviation of about 180 basis points.","On the operating margin side, the median has been about just under 21% and again knocking out the high highs and the low lows, you got about a 280 basis point standard deviation on the operating margin. You have to then add back or include what I would say we talk about the investments we've made on the cash amortization, that's anywhere from 6% to 8%. So think about the operating margin of 21%, we believe that those are on a cash basis in the high 20, low 30s.","Now on a relative basis, it's less mature than our NAST business and so we would expect both the net revenue margins on Global Forwarding as well as the operating margins given the investments that we've made to continue to expand both in the NAST and the Global Forwarding. ","Robert Houghton","Thanks Andy. The next question is also for Andy from Matt Young with Morningstar. Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company also asked a similar question.","Matthew Young","A few upstart digital freight brokers appear to be gaining some traction in the truck brokerage space at least from a gross revenue standpoint. Could you talk about what you're noticing if anything in the marketplace from these providers?","Andrew Clarke","Yes, I think it's appropriate that the first talk about and start off by answering that question and kind of really telling the story of our platform and then maybe begin to talk about what others are talking about what they're doing. And so, Robinson is a digital leader in the logistics space and it's a big, and it's a growing space, but we've been in it the longest. Bob mentioned we're spending as much if not more than anybody else.","We're connecting over 200,000 companies around the globe through that Navisphere technology platform. We\u2019re executing truckload, LTL, intermodal, ocean, air, customs, managed services, parcel and other services with over $20 billion in freight under management. 100% of our shipments are executed on the Navisphere platform. And again, why does that benefit? The benefit is obviously to our customers. They have one source of truth, but why does it benefit our carriers, it allows them to go to one place to get access to all of their information. And so, we believe in that one platform. And so we're going to continue to invest in it.","And while it's a big and really we're the largest, I wouldn't say that anybody could go out there and claim to have conquered logistics despite the fact that there are many people out there with that, there are many people out there with press releases. There are many people that are out there selling a story of how much they might have raised in a particular round, it's a big space and we're going to continue to lead in that.","Where we are seeing some of these competitors, digital competitors that you might have mentioned are really - we see them and select us because we have over 120,000 customers. And I say if you canvassed all of them, there's probably a 119,000 of those customers that aren't or haven't been doing business with the digital upstart. Now, there are 17,000 brokers, truckload brokers, freight brokers in North America right now, if you think about where that exists in the globe there is multiples of that as well.","And so we have had and will always have competition in the marketplace and to a large degree everybody is talking about technology. Our go-to-market has been and will continue to be our people, our process, and our technology. We believe that those three tenets are core to how we're going to continue to successfully grow our business, solve the complex global logistics needs of our customers, be a strategic provider to our carriers whether they be located in North America, whether they be located in Europe, Asia, Latin America. And so, we're pretty comfortable and pretty confident in our technology story, particularly vis-\u00e0-vis the startups.","Robert Houghton","Thanks Andy. The next question for John comes from several analysts.","Unidentified Analyst","How much business is currently under spot versus contract and do you think there will be a shift back to the spot market in 2019?","Andrew Clarke","We are today in our truckload business back to that more typical mix of having more committed or contractual activity, probably two-thirds or one-third, about 65%, 35% with more of that being committed or contracted today. With regards to where will it go in 2019 and it's just more difficult than ever to predict, but a few thoughts around that.","I guess coming off of 2018, where we showed on our charts double digit price increases over a short period of time and that being higher than anything that you see historically on any of those charts, those price increases were in part driven by some regulatory changes around ELV implementations and all of the carrier network changes that accompany those implementations, we don't see anything on the horizon that is that significant. There's no pending rule changes or anything that would suggest that that type of spot market activity or price increases won't happen again in the short term.","As I commented earlier, there has been some deceleration of pricing in the spot market and some opportunity where maybe the committed rates are softening a little bit and could drive some shippers to explore more spot market opportunities to take advantage of lower prices if that's where it sustains. So while we don't see anything big on the horizon that would drive it back to the spot market, kind of another factor to consider is that over the last decade as shippers have automated their supply chains and carriers have automated and tightened their network around how they run their capacity, there is less slack in the overall system which has led to more volatility and more greater price changes.","So while there's nothing big on the horizon that caused the price increases in 2018, the overall environment is predisposed towards faster changes and greater impacts that could result in more freight going back to the spot market if we see a meaningful change in the overall demand.","Robert Houghton","Thanks John. The next question for Bob comes from Matt Young with Morningstar.","Matthew Young","Could you provide some additional color on NAST efforts in terms of running more truckload transactions through a mobile platform along with a rough idea of the magnitude of adoption among C. H. Robinson shippers and carriers?","Robert Biesterfeld, Jr.","Sure. So a core cannon of our go-to-market strategy has always been to really meet our customers and carriers, how and where they want to buy. So our focus has been less on moving transactions to mobile as it has been around just really being focused on driving towards those frictionless transactions, we've based upon the preferences of our customers and our carriers. So a couple of examples, if a customer wants to integrate their ERP in our Navisphere, we just want to ensure that we're the easiest supply chain platform to connect to and extend our platform into their ERP.","If a customer wants to use the Navisphere platform to place orders or track shipments or get exception notifications, we want to ensure that we can provide that information via web or mobile in a means that serves their needs in the fastest most user friendly way. Another example of a carrier prefers to work in their native CMS versus in Navisphere, again we try to connect to their native CMS, ensure that they've got visibility to our freight and make it easier for us to connect to them.","Specific to mobile, in general we've seen the carrier community much more active in the mobile space than on the customer side. In terms of rough orders of magnitude today we capture about 55% of our truckload events in an automated fashion and much of that coming from mobile and we've got tens of thousands of active users every single day on the Navisphere carrier, both mobile and web platforms as well as the customer, primarily web platform.","Another example, our Book It Now [ph] feature, our Navisphere carrier continues to gain broader acceptance amongst the carrier community and we see more and more carriers taking advantage of the ability to come online either via the web or app and self serve by themselves book freight. On the customer side, we see relatively low adoption of mobile as the primary means for communication and ETI [ph] really continues to be the preferred method of electronic integration with the customers.","Robert Houghton","Thanks Bob. The next question is also for Bob from Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Todd flower of Key Banc and Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company also asked similar questions.","Ben Hartford","What are NAST and overall headcount growth plans for 2019?","Robert Biesterfeld, Jr.","In the simplest sense over the long term, we expect volume to grow at a rate ahead of our headcount growth. I made this commitment at our 2017 Investor Day relative to NAST and I believed that that formula still has application across our business in total. Over the past couple of years the mix of our job families has continued to evolve and as we continue to grow - really grow through some of the roles that are more task oriented, it allows us to improve productivity there and keep headcount relatively flat in some of those areas, and we'll continue to add more specialized skills and more customer facing people to drive growth and innovation in our workforce.","Our headcount growth moderated in the fourth quarter and our focus in 2019 and beyond is to continue to layer in that technology and process automation, so that our people can be even more effective which should further moderate headcount growth moving forward.","Robert Houghton","Thanks Bob. Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley asked about personal expenses. Tom Wadewitz with UBS also asked a similar question.","Ravi Shanker","Andy, what\u2019s your personal expense growth to be below net revenue growth?","Andrew Clarke","Well, again we talk about the operating leverage of our model and we've been pretty clear about how it does work and in fact 2018 is a great example of [indiscernible] in the fourth quarter, which I'll address shortly, but also for the full year if you think about it we added pretty significant net revenue during the entire year. But relative to last year headcount was relatively flat and in fact in certain cases with Global Forwarding and Robinson Fresh it was down. If you think about how they were able to grow their business, those two particular divisions with less headcount, we're pretty pleased with as Bob was talking about just before, the leverage that is inherent in our company and our platform.","As it relates to the fourth quarter, again just think about how much net revenue we additionally we drove during the quarter over $84 million. The bulk of the increase in the fourth quarter personnel expenses are related to performance based pay, both in terms of cash compensation as well as equity. So if you think about the headcount, again relatively flat on a Q4 versus Q4 basis, but because we performed so much more, a lot of that variable expense went up which obviously I think alliances we talk about the interests of our employees with the interests of our shareholders very well, and that's the beauty and that's how our models always work throughout different cycles.","Robert Houghton","Thanks Andy. The next question for John on tariffs came from several analysts.","Unidentified Analyst","Have you seen any impact in your forwarding business from the tariffs from both the U.S. and China or the political economic unrest in Europe? We have heard other large international logistics and retail companies mention both of these as headwinds in 2019, curious if you are seeing an impact and what your outlook is for forwarding in 2019 given these overhangs?","John Wiehoff","Yes, we've been growing our Global Forwarding business the last five years by taking market share in the number of corridors around the world and we do continue to believe that we're going to be successful doing that in 2019 as well. The primary impact to date or and in the year 2018 was the processes around implementing and collecting the increased tariffs, as well as some modest increase and shipment activities probably nearer or at the end of the year to try to accelerate some of the activities to get in before year end or get in before tariffs.","There's still so much remaining uncertainty around where those trade negotiations in Asia and Europe will both land. So beyond the minor impacts that we had to our business in 2018 all of the discussion around supply chain strategy, where will your suppliers be, will shippers have to move out of China into other places in Asia, those communications are going on and the planning is accelerating as we speak. So there is high potential for greater changes in routing, greater changes in sourcing areas for a lot of our customers, but we haven't seen a lot of that activity to date.","We've mentioned in the past and continue to invest in expanding and scaling our Global Forwarding network precisely for reasons like this, that if customers do end up making decisions that these tariffs and supply chain changes are going to be permanent and move their sourcing locations, we're confident that we'll be able to move with them and that we have capabilities in other parts of the world that will be able to continue to go after that market share and grow our business regardless of where the trade negotiations land.","Robert Houghton","Thanks John. The next question is for Andy from several analysts.","Unidentified Analyst","Why did the annual increase in cash from operations up $409 million significantly exceed growth in annual net income up $160 million, what were the drivers?","Andrew Clarke","Yes, 2018 was a fantastic year for us from a cash flow from operations and obviously you got net income up 160, but Bob mentioned earlier the investments that we're making on the Freightquote cash, but there's also the ordinary cash and once it becomes an order across the organization from the business to support from financial operations, driving down that order to cash cycle.","And so, if you think about the decrease on a year-over-year basis and the need for spending that on working capital, the largest contributor of that came from the effort there and that's why we're making a lot of investments on digitalization, that's why we're making a lot of investments in standardization, streamlining that part of the organization, so that we would expect to continue to see improvements in that area.","Robert Houghton","Thanks. The next question is also for Andy from Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch asked a similar question.","Ken Hoexter","With the truckload spot market rolling over on a year-over-year basis, how would you expect net revenue margins to trend as 2019 progresses?","Andrew Clarke","I think years back to kind of what we talked about earlier on the net revenue margins, dollar percentages is largely a function of arithmetic. And so, if you look at one of the slides that we have in the earnings deck and that\u2019s the relative change we talk about how those cycles tend to go in three to four to five quarter periods where cost is always the leader. When costs rise or fall pricing tends to follow that.","We solved that through a balanced period and we talked about that earlier and when it begins to tip over and costs go down, price tends to lag there, which does have a positive impact on the margins, but on a relative basis you see that the pricing cost numbers on a sanitized, the numbers are reported are at an elevated level.","And so, there is a balancing impact of fuel, balancing impact of the numerator or denominator simply being higher, but overall when costs begin to decrease it does tend to have a positive impact on our truckload margins. We've made a lot of investments, Bob mentioned earlier on the LTL side to be smarter on the pricing and the cost side, and so we would continue to expect to drive secular margin expansion in other parts of our business as well.","Robert Houghton","Thanks Andy. The next question is for Bob from [indiscernible] from Bloomberg. Brian [indiscernible] with J.P. Morgan asked a similar question. If the implementation of precision schedule routing in the east, drive the 13% decline in Intermodal volume, if not what was the driver?","Robert Biesterfeld, Jr.","So we don't believe that PSR has had a broad impact on our Intermodal volumes for the quarter, nor we expected to. We have seen examples where lane cancellations have either eliminated Intermodal options altogether or new routings have created drainage [ph] inefficiencies which has made the routing more cost effective using truckload which could potentially benefit us. In terms of our volume decline for the quarter was really driven by less spot market opportunity and truckload intermodal conversion as well as lower than expected West Coast volumes when compared to the peak season of last year.","Robert Houghton","Thanks Bob. Andy, Todd Fowler of KeyBanc and Tom Wadewitz with UBS asked about M&A.","Thomas Wadewitz","Please provide an update on potential acquisition opportunities, both service line and geographies and if you feel anything is imminent in 2019.","Andrew Clarke","Well, I'm going to talk about the first one in terms of that the potential acquisition opportunities we have and will continue to be an active participant in the M&A environment. We look at transactions every day that are complimentary to both our service line, whether that be NAST, whether that be our Global Forwarding or Robinson Fresh, but we also look at it in terms of geographical expansion and go back and talk about how it made investments over the last several years in Global Forwarding, we continue to make investments in NAST as we did with the acquisition of Freightquote and those are pretty much part of our standard routine as it relates to assisting and enabling our rather strong organic strategy, growth strategy that we have in place. And so I wouldn\u2019t say that there is anything materially different as to how we're looking about it.","I would say that it continues to be a robust environment for well run organizations. We are very selective in the acquisitions that not only we look at but also execute upon, and so they have to meet a rather stringent criteria, both in terms of strategy, culture and business model. And then of course financial returns are very important to how we view and evaluate those opportunities. And so, I wouldn't say that there's anything materially different in 2019 of our strategy versus, what it's been over the last several years.","Robert Houghton","Thanks Andy.

Wiehoff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson third quarter 2015 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, Tim Gagnon will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, October 28, 2015.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, the Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thank you, Erika, and good morning, everyone. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, Chief Executive Officer and Andy Clarke, Chief Financial Officer. John and Andy will provide some prepared comments on the highlight of our third quarter and will follow that with a response to the pre-submitted questions we received after earnings last night.","Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate the discussion. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Andy will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments.","I'd like to remind you that comments made by John, Andy or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","With that, I'll now turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments on slide three with a review of our third quarter results.","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We had a very good third quarter led by total net revenues of $588 million, which represented an 11.6% increase over last year's third quarter. Our organic net revenues grew at 5%, while the Freightquote acquisition contributed another 6.5 percentage points to our net revenue growth in the quarter. Our organic business growth was driven largely by North American truckload services with truckload net revenue growing as a result of both volume growth and improved margins. As has been the case throughout the year, net revenues grew more than total revenues, due primarily to the impact of lower fuel prices this year.","Couple of our other key financial metrics: income from operations increased 14.4% in the quarter, and net income increased 11.6%. Our network did a great job in the quarter, and we again accomplished good productivity and results in most of our core services.","We had earnings per share of $0.96 in the quarter, and that compares to $0.85 last year or a 12.9% increase. One of the other key metrics, our average head count or employee total increased 13% in the quarter. Again, that was about a 4% increase in our organic base of business, and the remainder of the increase coming from the Freightquote acquisition.","Before I turn it over to Andy to walk through the specific revenue lines and service items, I thought maybe I would just highlight what we sort of view as some of the key highlights for the quarter that you'll hear come throughout the comments. First, net revenue margin increases. You'll see in most of the services that we did have improving net revenue margins. In a business model like ours where the market is softer from a demand standpoint than was anticipated at the beginning of the year, it's not surprising, and I think it's consistent with what you see elsewhere in the industry that our net revenue margins would be improving across our service offerings.","Second, a lot of references to Freightquote. We've tried to be as transparent as we can by showing what impact Freightquote had on the key line items across our results. From an overall standpoint, I would say that we're very happy with the Freightquote acquisition. We continue to believe that it's been a great fit for our company and that it has really helped us penetrate certain segments of the market in a much more effective way. So we continue to feel very positive about that acquisition, and you'll hear a lot of references to the impact that it's had on us.","The last item that I'd like to highlight from a productivity efficiency standpoint, we've referenced many times in the past that probably the key enterprise metric around that is our operating income as a percent of net revenue, and you'll see that improved in the quarter versus last year. And, again, there's a lot of changes and a lot of different impacts that Andy and I will talk about that impact that, but from an overall standpoint, the fact that that improved year-over-year and has improved year-to-date is reflective of what we feel is good productivity and efficiency in the business. So those are some of the highlights that I would point out to you before we jump in.","With that, I'll turn it over to Andy to walk through our financial results for the quarter.","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, John, and good morning. Before moving on to slide four, I would also like to thank all of our people for their hard work in delivering best-in-class performance during the quarter and throughout the year. I think it's fair to say our team put the puck in the back of the net this quarter.","Total net revenue grew by 12.5%, with truckload growing 10.8%, LTL growing 38.6% and intermodal contracting slightly by 4%. Net revenue margin improved by 220 basis points to 18.4% versus last year's third quarter. The two primary drivers of this margin expansion were fuel and the overall market conditions. I will speak to the specifics in my comments on the various services.","Turning to our truckload results on slide five, we had another strong quarter in our truckload business, growing volume at 7%. The organic volume growth was approximately 4% in the quarter, and Freightquote added approximately 3%. We are proud of the fact that this is the 24th consecutive quarter where we have grown our year-over-year North America truckload volume. We also believe we were able to take share in the quarter, as most of the benchmarks we look at showed slight year-over-year declines in volume.","Net revenues grew nearly 11%. Organic net revenues increased approximately 8%, with Freightquote adding approximately 3% in the third quarter. We have continued to focus on balanced growth, and, clearly, we're executing well to that end. In North America, the line haul price per mile to our customers, excluding the impact of fuel, was flat on a year-over-year basis, while the cost paid to carriers decreased approximately 1%. The overall market was less volatile in this third quarter when compared to last year in the third quarter.","There are two interesting points to highlight. The first comes from the routing guide depth associated with our managed services businesses where we saw routing guide compliance at the high end of our historical benchmarks. The second point is our negative loads were down significantly in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Both these facts are an indication that capacity is available and there are minimal disruptions to the procurement plans of shippers.","We had another strong quarter signing on new contracted carriers. In the third quarter we, again, added over 3,000 carriers, and these carriers moved over 20,000 shipments for us. Year-to-date, we have added approximately 9,000 new contracted carriers.","Let's move to slide six and the less-than-truckload results. Our LTL net revenues increased 38.6%. Organic net revenues increased approximately 6%, while Freightquote contributed approximately 33% to our LTL net revenue in the third quarter of 2015. LTL volumes increased 32%. Freightquote contributed approximately 19% and organic growth was 13%.","Net revenue margin increased on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, primarily as a result of the higher margin Freightquote business with small customers and growth in our consolidation business. Both Freightquote and our organic business continue to do well with the significant activity happening in the industry during the quarter. We continue to feel very good about our value proposition and our approach to the marketplace with our LTL services. Further, we're confident we provide a unique and sought-after service to both our shippers and carriers with our non asset-based strategy.","Transitioning to our intermodal results on slide seven, intermodal net revenue decreased 4% in the third quarter with volume down 4% as well. Without Freightquote, organic net revenues decreased approximately 13% in the third quarter. The intermodal volume continues to be impacted by lower fuel prices and a looser capacity in the truckload environment with some shippers converting freight back over the road. Year-to-date, our net revenue is up 6% versus last year with volume up 5%.","And now to slide eight and a review of our Global Forwarding business. Net revenue for the Global Forwarding services increased 1.8% over the third quarter of 2014. While the 1.8% represents a lower growth rate than our year-to-date trend, it is important to remember the very strong quarter in 2014 we had as a result of the additional services provided during the disruption at the ports. The macro environment in this quarter was challenging, with rates dropping and capacity readily available; however, we were able to grow our volumes and took market share in the quarter.","Our ocean net revenues increased 1.6% in the third quarter while air decreased 1.3% and custom services were up 8.1%.","Our cross-selling initiatives are producing new opportunities for us and did drive net revenue growth in the quarter. We are proud of the fact that we were able to retain the number one rank as the NVOCC with the largest number of TEUs shipped from China to the U.S. again in the third quarter. In air freight, though our net revenues decreased, we added new customers in the quarter and grew our air freight tonnage. Customs net revenues increased 8.1% due to an increase in transaction volume.","Moving to other logistics services on slide nine, the services in this group include transportation management services, warehousing, and small parcel. Net revenues increased 7.3% in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Managed services represent over half of the net revenue in this area and that business is performing well with good net revenue growth. We added new customers in the quarter, and the pipeline of signed customers in the queue is increasing nicely. These customers require supply chain technology, great transportation processes, and execution on a global basis. And we've built the platform to handle this growth and will continue to innovate with this service going forward.","Transitioning to our sourcing business on slide 10, our sourcing net revenues decreased 4.4% in the quarter, while case volume grew 2.5%. As with most quarters, we had some ups and downs across the many categories we serve in the sourcing business. In a couple of our strategic vegetable categories, we had some very tough markets that had an impact on our net revenue in the quarter. We believe those impacts should be isolated to the third quarter, and the sourcing team is working hard to serve their customers and finish up the year strong. Year-to-date, we are up nearly 3% net revenue, and case volume is up 5%.","Slide 11 covers our summarized income statement for the third quarter. The operating income as a percent of net revenue was 39.5% in the third quarter, and this represents the fifth consecutive quarter with a year-over-year increase in this key metric. This also represents a 100 basis point improvement versus last year. We have and will continue to invest in our people and organization, but we will also do so in a balanced way.","Personnel expenses were up 8% in the quarter. This was primarily due to the additional head count related to our acquisition of Freightquote. As a percent of net revenue, personnel expenses improved 150 basis points to 44.9%.","Other SG&A expenses increased 15.3%. This increase was, again, primarily due to the Freightquote acquisition, including amortization expense of $1.9 million. We also had an increase in claims and travel expenses in the quarter. We expect the rate of increases and expenses relating to the Freightquote acquisition to decrease as we are pleased with the progress we are making on the integration.","Moving on to slide 11 and other financial information, we had a very good cash flow quarter, generating just over $213 million. Year-to-date cash flow generated is $465 million. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $13.2 million and year-to-date CapEx is $33 million. We continue to expect the 2015 capital expenditures to be between $40 million and $50 million. We recently began the development of our new offsite data recovery facility, and that will consume the bulk of the remaining CapEx for the year.","We finished the quarter with just over $1 billion in debt, which was broken down between $500 million with an average coupon of 4.28% and $530 million drawn on a revolver with a current rate of 1.32% as of September 30, 2015.","And finally, before turning it back to John, let's go to slide 13 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $130 million to shareholders in the quarter with approximately $57 million in dividends and $73 million in share repurchases. We finished the quarter returning approximately 93% of net income to shareholders. For the year, we have returned 88%, which is in line with our target to return approximately 90% of net income to our shareholders annually.","Again, thank you to the entire Robinson team for your great work to produce these results. And thank you, as well to those listening today. We appreciate your interest in our company. With that, I'll turn it back to John to make some closing comments.","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, thank you, Andy, and my closing comments will be focused on the look ahead slide. Consistent with previous periods, we want to share the headlines of what we know about October with you and from that standpoint, the total company net revenue growth in October is tracking at a consistent growth rate, consistent with the third quarter. The trucking market in North America continues to be a little bit soft from a demand standpoint and that continues to be reflected in our results.","In our Q&A session with the submitted questions that we have, there's a lot of things that are asking about pricing and the market dynamics that will come back to around that net revenue growth and what we're seeing in the marketplace. I think from an overall standpoint, one of the things that we wanted to highlight, though is that the trucking industry continues to be a cyclical industry and one of the things that we've experienced over the last four or five years and we continue to expect to see is how we adapt to the cyclicality of that marketplace. And, again, some of the Q&A comments will come back to that, but a lot of our net revenue growth this year has been enabled by responding to a market that has a little bit softer demand and taking advantage of the marketplace from the standpoint of serving our customers in a more effective way.","Before we move to the Q&A session, I want to touch on just a few of the strategic priorities that we have bullet pointed on our look ahead slide. While we adapt to those shorter term cycles in the market, we believe that, kind of the primary foundation of how we create value over a longer period of time is by focusing in on some of these important competitive advantages that really are the foundation of how we go to market and how we serve our customers over a long period of time. It really starts with our sales and account management initiatives, and we are as focused on them as we've ever been. We are delivering record amounts of training and we continue to be very focused on the effectiveness of our sales and account management initiatives across our network.","The fourth quarter and first quarters of the years are always a little bit more active around bid periods, so those groups today, both on the customer side with our account managers, as well as our capacity account managers, are all very engaged with the marketplace on a localized way to make sure that we understand the varying needs and perspectives of the tens of thousands of people that we interact with and making sure that all of our customers and capacity providers have good and efficient access to our network.","So, we are very proud of our sales and account management capabilities and we will continue to invest in those people and those processes to make sure that we're maintaining our competitive advantage in the marketplace.","Talent acquisition and development. We've hired throughout the year. We highlighted kind of the increases in our employee base and head count. We are continuing to hire. Our hiring tapers-off near the end of the year and increases in the spring because we're hiring primarily new college graduates that we will continue to focus on. But from an annual basis, we do expect to continue to add to our workforce and add to our team of sales and account management people in accordance with our primary metric around volume growth. So, while we do expect to hire during 2016, we remain pretty fluid with regards to understanding the marketplace and understanding the rate at which we're taking market share and making sure that we add proportionately to how we're growing our business. But we do expect to continue to hire. We think talent acquisition and identifying the right types of cultural fits and people that we are looking for are, again, a really important competitive advantage. That's part of the foundation of the company that we're not going to lose focus on regardless of what part of the cycles we might be in in any of our services.","The next point, technology, I mean, people process and technology is the tagline that we've been using for decades and is really an important part of how we think about building value over time and maintaining all of these advantages. As we look into 2016, we're going to continue to increase our investment in technology, spending well over $100 million a year with our IT team to make sure that we're investing in capabilities to achieve a number of things.","We focused on connectivity around both that [audio skip] (19:12) to make sure that the people who are accessing our network have visibility to what they want as well as efficient ways to exchange information with us. We've got some enhancements to our mobile applications that we think will be very impactful next year and that we think will have some good value for our customers and particularly our capacity providers on the mobile strategies.","Security and stability. As we work with large customers and more collaborative outsource solutions, it's very important that we secure the data and that we have the right sort of stability in our systems to facilitate the real time programs that we do, so that's an area that we'll continue to invest heavily in.","Purchase order, order management, inventory management capabilities. As we get more integrated into our customer supply chains, it becomes more and more important that we can consolidate, deconsolidate, that we can provide information at the order level and help our customers drive efficiencies and manage inventory in their supply chain. And that will continue to be an important investment area for us.","Analytics and data science. We have a very significant data warehouse and a lot of capabilities around analytics that we extend to both our capacity providers and our customers, and we will continue to invest in that to make sure that we have market-leading information and that we can help our customers adapt to the changing market conditions, just as we do with our own business model.","So those are a couple of the areas that I wanted to highlight that we're going to continue to invest as technology continues to change in our industry. We believe we're one of the leaders, and we've got some good things in works that we think will continue to keep us in a good competitive spotlight.","The last bullet point that we highlighted on there, from a strategic priority standpoint, is mergers and acquisition. As we've said many times, we've been around for 110 years, and our two largest acquisitions in our 110-year history have both occurred in the last three years, with Phoenix and Freightquote acquisitions. We have not changed our approach or our messaging around acquisitions. We continue to have what we believe is a very meaningful filter around finding the right sorts of deals for Robinson, and that starts with cultural fit but also encompasses all the right sort of financial metrics and business model parameters that we think are important to providing integrated services and managing our business as one global network.","So we'll continue to have those high standards of what we think is the right sort of addition to Robinson. However, given the current capital environment and the activity in the marketplace and our ability to use our balance sheet more if appropriate, we are going to continue to look and to try to identify opportunities where we can create value by expanding our M&A activity as well, too. Increasing our global footprint and increasing our service capabilities are probably the two broad bullet points that we would focus in, in terms of priorities and the types of acquisitions that we think would have the most ability to add value.","So those are some of the strategic priorities. Again, it's important to highlight those, because I think those are the long-term foundation of creating value while we do our best to adapt and help our customers and capacity providers adapt to the cycles in the marketplace.","With that, that concludes our prepared comments for this morning and I will turn it over to Tim to facilitate our Q&A session of the call.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. And I'd like to start by thanking the many analysts and investors for sending in the questions late yesterday afternoon and evening. A lot of good questions. I've done my best to organize them categorically and turn it over to John and Andy and respond to them. So we'll get right into it with the Q&A portion here.","Question-and-Answer Session","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","The first question is for Andy, and it states, can you break down how much of the net revenue margin expansion in the third quarter came from mix versus lower purchase transportation?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. As we indicated, we had a 220 basis point improvement in that key metric during the quarter, and just over 40% of that was due to fuel, just under 40% of that was due to the market conditions, and the remaining, this is, say, 20% was the Freightquote mix and other.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Okay, thanks, Andy. The next question around technology, for John, to elaborate a little bit on your comments that you just made. Please elaborate on the strategic priorities included on slide 14, specifically with respect to the technology development and innovation. Is this aimed at improving employee productivity or more of an outward-facing solution towards the marketplace?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The answer is both. Prioritizing and determining what we're going to work on and focus in, in the technology area has become increasingly challenging, just because of the universe of opportunities that exist. But for several decades now, we have tried to adapt or adopt a balanced approach towards focusing in on productivity initiatives, as well as some of the connectivity initiatives that I talked about before, with making sure that the exchange of data and the transparency of data is there.","And an important focus, too, is that market-facing customer insights, customer analytics, making sure that we've got everything that we need to create better solutions and help our customers and capacity providers get smarter in the marketplace. So it's both balancing the prioritization of those two types of initiatives is something that we go through very aggressively every quarter and try to make sure that we're balancing all of those different motivations in the best we can.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Okay, thanks, John. Next question for Andy. Can you please give us an update on your cross-selling efforts as they relate to Phoenix and Freightquote?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Certainly. And I'll start by saying, as John mentioned, from a macro perspective, we're extremely pleased with both acquisitions. We've owned Phoenix for just over three years now. And in terms of the progression, where we are today in year three is, quite frankly, where we thought we'd be in year five when we did the acquisition. So in terms of cross-selling, what we have called phase two is selling North American services to the legacy Phoenix customers has gone extremely well. And phase three was selling Global Forwarding services to our traditional North American customers, again, is progressing very nicely and generating significant results for us in the Global Forwarding and in the North American service transportation.","As it relates to Freightquote, again, we've just owned that great business since the beginning of the year, and we are very excited about the progress we're making there, specifically, I think, as John mentioned, our go-to-market strategy, particularly with small customers. So very, very pleased with the cross-selling efforts on both acquisitions.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. The next question for John around pricing. Given that truckload carriers are now guiding to a more muted pricing outlook for 2016, can you elaborate on your pricing outlook and the opportunity for net revenue margin improvement?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","For the last five years, we've been sharing our quarterly activity in terms of what we've experienced on average rate per mile and average price increases to our shippers, as well as our average cost of hire and change to the capacity providers that we have. Andy mentioned earlier in review of the slides that for the current quarter, the pricing was relatively flat and the cost of hire was down 1%. If you look back over the last five years, I think the five-year average of those numbers that we've disclosed is somewhere around 4.5%, and I think very consistent with what we, and maybe many others in the industry, have been saying that there is some underlying cost pressure increases around driver shortages and increased equipment and increased regulation that's limiting productivity.","So you put that all together, and over the last five years, think the industry and we have seen some above inflation cost increases due to a lot of the factors that have been talked about in the industry. However, when you look at the last five years from quarter-to-quarter standpoint and a year-to-year standpoint, those increases have, at times, been double-digits and, at times, have been flat to small declines. So my earlier comments kind of setting up around the cyclicality of what going, gets (27:56) very difficult to predict the cycles and to really time them perfectly in terms of understanding what's going on in the marketplace. But there's no question as you look at our results and look at the industry that the price increases and the rate of growth have tapered off during the year as the market has softened. And we see that continuing into the fourth quarter as we shared with our October results to-date so far in terms of what we're seeing.","We also talked about fourth quarter and first quarter being an active bid season. And, again, I think one of the things that's important to remember about C.H. Robinson is we do not have centralized pricing decision-making, we do not have GRIs, we do not give targeted price increases across the network. It's that decentralized account management strategy that is working with all of our shippers and all of our capacity providers to work literally on thousands of lanes in each of these bids that we participate in. And it becomes very fragmented and very spread out in terms of how we think about making adjustments and properly repositioning ourselves in the route guide based on what our customers want from us and all those relationships. So no question there's a more muted pricing outlook, and we're down on the lower end of that range of change that we've seen over the last five years. But in terms of exactly what it means in terms of price increases, that really probably remains to be seen based upon the next couple of quarters and how the marketplace continues to evolve.","In terms of predicting our net revenue margins, that gets even a little bit more challenging, because really whether our net revenue margins expand or contract, over the last five years, they've, as I mentioned earlier, both the pricing to the customers and our cost of hire have averaged a comparable amount. But sometimes the change gets ahead of each other on one side, where customer pricing or capacity costs might be moving at a little bit different rate. And most of that is centered around whether or not we've anticipated or we and our shippers have anticipated the market impacts correctly. So everybody's expecting a softer market and everybody is moving down towards the lower end of price changes in the range, and really whether net revenue margins on that committed business expand or contract probably has more to do with how next year compares to what everybody is expecting during these bids versus the absolute tightness of the market year-over-year. So that's why it's difficult for us and we don't try to guide or expect exactly what's going to happen with our net revenue margin, but we believe our track record of adapting to market conditions and adjusting both our customer pricing and our capacity pricing consistently over time, that that track record sort of speaks for itself.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question is for Andy around regulation. What impact, if any, do you expect electronic logging devices to have on your ability to source capacity in 2016?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks. Similar what we said in our second quarter call, obviously, we're watching the situation very closely, but we still think it's too early to make a hard determination on impact. We will watch it closely. We will continue to monitor, as we've always done, and react to the final regulations when they're published. But it's no different than any other regulation that comes out. I mean, we're going to continue to secure capacity.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John on head count. What is your expectation for head count into 2016? How do current fundamentals, namely tighter or looser North America truckload supply dynamics, influence this decision?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I touched on this earlier in some of the prepared comments that we are hiring and we do expect to continue to hire into 2016. Under our balanced growth initiatives across the network, it would probably be low to mid single-digit employee head counts is what we would target as our baseline of activity, priding ourselves and kind of remaining flexible to adapt to what's going on in the marketplace. Again, the primary metric that we're looking at in terms of people and talent is around volume activity. We know that the margins are going to fluctuate.","If you look back at our commentary over the last several years, when we're aggressively taking more market share, we do need to add people into those sales and account management roles to facilitate that high volume growth. There have been other periods of time when we've been adapting to aggressive market changes and not experiencing the same significant volume growth, but really focusing in on price changes and adapting to more volatile market conditions where we've talked about leveraging the experienced team that we have more as opposed to adding. So, like many years, we're going into next year with a balanced growth approach, hoping to add to our team and continue to strengthen it, but we will adapt to market conditions largely based upon our view of opportunity for volume and market share opportunities.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. To what extent do you see risk to your core business model from potentially disruptive truck brokerage technology platforms, given the growing number of Uber-like startups in logistics?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. This is a space we're paying very close attention to because quite frankly, we're in it every day. Scale, technology, capital, and access to customers in capacity matter in this regard. I think our advantage is the ability to connect tens of thousands of small, medium, and large customers with hundreds of thousands of small, medium, and large carriers across multiple modes and geographies. This market is significantly more challenging than pulling up a mobile app and securing a ride. It's about connecting customers and carriers across multiple supply chains and transportation management systems. I think the good news is, as John mentioned, we're spending over $100 million a year with our technology team and we've got some really sharp people that are focused exclusively on this area.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. The next question for John. A little more detail on October. How is the fourth quarter started in terms of demand?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I shared earlier that our net revenue growth has been fairly consistent into October. If you break that down a little bit more, the market has been pretty soft from a demand standpoint. If anything, in the first part of October here, there's maybe a little bit less volume growth and a little bit more margin expansion to get to that consistent net revenue growth. This time of year is always interesting because historically there had been a lot of traditional fall peak activity and volumes had fairly predictably peaked during this time of the year. So things can change quickly and there's still time left, and we don't know exactly what will happen over the next month or two, but the market is pretty soft right now from a demand standpoint.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. What's your opinion on the benefits of asset light companies bulking up on assets in order to get a better seat at the negotiating table during bid season? Is that a strategy you've entertained in this or any other market?\"","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","I'll simply say that we're in the business of providing solutions to and solving problems for our customers. Every day, our people partner with our customers and carriers and use our process and technology to accomplish this. I think our results would indicate that our customers and carriers think we're doing a pretty good job of partnering with them. We believe focusing on solutions, regardless of who owns the assets, is the right approach, and I can't think of a situation where a customer has not afforded us a prominent seat at the table because of our non asset-based model.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Net operating margins have continued to expand in 2015. Understanding mix related to the Phoenix acquisition may limit the ability to return to pre-Phoenix levels. Can you discuss the potential for additional margin improvement from areas the company is able to control internally?\"","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So the question is referencing, first, the mix issue on Global Forwarding, where any of the market leaders in the Global Forwarding have lower efficiency ratios in terms of operating income to net revenue, and that's true in our Global Forwarding business as well, too. So that has put some downward pressure on that metric relative to our history.","In addition, because we have completed those two large acquisitions of Phoenix and Freightquote, the purchase accounting and some of those amortization costs in those business services also puts some downward pressure on that. We have been able to improve that this year. I would say it's a combination of things. If you go back three years ago, we talked a lot about not only including the purchase accounting from Phoenix, but there was a significant amount of integration spending that we went through, in 2013, especially, where today, I feel like we're harvesting some of those efficiencies, and that service offering has continued to get much more efficient and contribute in a great way to that improved operating income.","Where can we go from here? There are other services and other areas that we've been investing in but have not reached scale that we would like to in terms of achieving operating income margins that we think are sustainable. I would throw out Europe as an area where we've invested heavily in the last 20 years and feel like there's opportunity to improve that. Our managed services, as we continue to aggressively implement new relationships, there's a lot of implementation spending that happens early on in those relationships that, as we mature that business it should provide some opportunity for improvement. We've talked about our lack of scale in intermodal and a few other startup or emerging services where we think we could improve that. That, combined with using technology, just to continue to improve our core business processes and what we're doing, we do have a pretty healthy list of ways that we hope to be able to continue to improve that operating margin. We've also acknowledged that, since it is industry-leading in terms of where it's at right now, that in the balance of growth and profitability or efficiency that we want to stay focused on the growth side of the continuum. So we are going to continue to look for ways to grow our business and expand our services, even if they don't always instantly improve that metric for us.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. The next question for Andy around M&A. Please provide an update on your view around the acquisition market, specifically what modal offerings and\/or geographies seem attractive, and what is your view?\"","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. As John highlighted in the opening comments, this has been and will continue to be a priority for us. We've done two very good acquisitions in the last three years and are very comfortable with our ability to have integrated them. But, as John mentioned, we have a pretty rigorous kind of strategy filter that we run the acquisitions through. So we're aware of a lot of the assets that are out there. We continue to look, every day, at ways of enhancing areas and markets where we think we can generate more scale, and John -- John just mentioned, obviously, Europe is one of those areas that we continue to look at, as well as bolstering our services in North America. We think we're a preferred buyer. We think as a strategic \u2013 we are very thoughtful in how we integrate acquisitions. And we're very cognizant of the partners that we choose when we do that. So we have, and we'll continue to look at acquisitions and hope to continue to do more in the future.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. You continue to take share from your competition. Is there a particular company or a particular competitor profile that you're having the most success against?\"","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The answer to that is really no, and it speaks to something that we've emphasized a lot in the past, that while this is a very competitive industry, and like most industries, getting more and more competitive all the time, it also remains very fragmented. Really, if you look across all the different service offerings that we have, even though we acknowledge there's a lot of new, worthy competitors, there still are thousands of them in almost every service offering that we have. So while there's a lot of change in the competitive landscape, and it remains a very competitive industry, most of these bids that we're participating in literally have hundreds of providers in each bid scenario that we're working on with our larger customers.","With a mix shift and changes and shippers evolving their roles, we're constantly trying to improve our market share and our relationship in terms of the activity, but it's very difficult to understand who you might be taking it from, or in the aggregate, why you're winning or losing against specific people. The last thing that I would share is we do believe that from a 3PL standpoint, a common \u2013 a significant trend in the marketplace has been that more and more of the activity out there is, probably, running through a 3PL today versus 10 years ago, so that some of the market share gains are coming from the evolution of the marketplace itself, where models like us are more accepted and maybe not coming directly from a competitor as well.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy, ocean net revenue growth slowed considerably in the third quarter. Is this a function of more difficult comps? Is your 2% net revenue growth in line with, above or below the market?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think what we're seeing is a result of multiple rate reductions in the Transpacific Eastbound that has decreased enough to cause customers to request new quotes. The reduction in rates is because of increased capacity and lower volumes being shipped. In quoting new rates we're having to reduce margins to remain competitive. From our research, this is an industry-wide event and quite frankly in line with market if not a little above.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John, I know it's still little early and there's a lot of moving pieces, but do you think customers are interested in securing or perhaps even over-securing capacity for 2016, as they were in 2015? If not, how do you think that manifests itself in bid discussions around pricing?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So we've talked a couple times about the cyclicality in the truckload space and, kind of from our standpoint, how those changes to pricing and changes in capacity availability have cycled over the last five years and really over the last couple of decades. Probably no doubt when you're in a \u2013 as part of the cycle like we are now where demand is softening, that it would be very logical that people would be a little bit less concerned about locking down committed capacity for next year, because the sentiment going in is that capacity's going to be more available.","We have talked about one of the ongoing tensions in this bid process and trying to anticipate the cycles of truckload is that you can go after very aggressive rates and committed pricing, and if the market moves and tightens up and price increases become more significant than everybody was anticipating, that can be very challenging to your route guide and cause the need for a lot of meaningful adjustments and changes or exposure to the spot market as you go forward, so, probably, less concern about locking down capacity for 2016 today versus a year ago. However, there remains that sort of ongoing tension around really trying to anticipate the cyclicality of the market and make sure that you optimize your approach to the marketplace to get a good outcome for next year.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy, can you comment on the pricing environment in freight forwarding? The ocean freight capacity situation is obvious, but there seems to be more capacity as well in air freight with the belly space growth.","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, the belly space growth comes from the addition of new passenger planes coming online. What we're seeing is market reductions and volumes in both of the ocean and air markets. The oversupply with the decreased volumes is causing quick and frequent reduction to rates. The carriers can't cover the operating cost on freighters at the current levels. So, all the information points to this lasting at least to the end of the year.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John on the sourcing business. Sourcing, once again had a disappointing quarter with net revenue declining 4% year-over-year, what needs to happen to return this business to consistent growth?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So the 4% decline in net revenue was below our internal hopes and expectations, however, when you look at our Robinson Fresh business, very similar to what I talked about in the look ahead comments. The long approach towards adding value is to really improve or increase our participation, our market share around our volume and the types of products and commodities that we're interacting with and integrate those into our transportation services to provide better answers for the customers. We did increase our volume, but similar to truckload, the produce industry is very cyclical as well, too, so we are going to continue \u2013 we always have and we will continue to see fluctuations in crop availability and the types of supply and demand relationships that will impact our margins.","With a lot of the weather situations and some of the volatility of the various crops that we do buy and sell and distribute for our customers, we do expect to continue to see some volatile results. Our year-to-date net revenue growth for our sourcing business is probably fairly consistent with what our longer term expectations are. And remember that for this Robinson Fresh business, internally, there's also some temperature controlled transportation that is aligned with those perishable commodities. And our temperature controlled transportation results have been consistent with our overall transportation results, providing good growth for the year. So that division with inside of Robinson has done a nice job of servicing their customers and growing their presence in the marketplace, and just due to the nature of the business where we're buying and selling the fresh commodities, we do expect to continue to see some volatility in the net revenue growth from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy about Freightquote. What did Freightquote's organic growth rate look like for its LTL and truckload businesses?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks. As we've mentioned numerous times both on this call and previous, we're pretty pleased with the acquisition of Freightquote and how it fits well into the Robinson culture and our go-to-market strategy. That being said, we don't disclose what the organic growth rate is, although I will share that they are actually tracking to the plan that they laid out and we laid out when we did the acquisition.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Can you remind us how much of the truck brokerage book of business is contractual versus transactional? Does it stand to reason that if truckload rates are less robust and potentially trend lower in the fourth quarter and 2016, that the contractual business will experience more net revenue margin improvement than the transactional business?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, the definition of committed or contractual business and the definition of spot market, as we've said many times in the past is \u2013 it's tough to be very specific. There's a more of a continuum of relationships around where we are in the route guide and what exactly those commitments represent. If you go back 15, 20 years Robinson was almost 100% transactional. We were pretty much reacting every day to what opportunities were available. Over the last couple of decades, as we've integrated in with larger shippers and have participated in a lot of the annual bid processes to sign up for committed volumes and activities, that business has become somewhere around half or maybe a little bit more of our business today. So, our most common answer to that is it's roughly half contracted and half spot market business, but in reality on a day-to-day basis, the amount of freight that's moving under pre-priced contracts versus the amount of freight that's moving in the spot market can change based upon the supply and demand conditions in the marketplace and how the market is reacting. So that's the answer on the first part of the question.","From the second part, in terms of will we experience net revenue margin improvement, again, I'd go back to the answer that I gave earlier. The challenging part there is that as we renew these bids in the next couple of quarters and reset the pricing levels in a lot of the committed or contracted freight, we're working with our capacity providers and looking at our historical analytics and anticipating the market to try to come up with what we think is the right approach in 2016.","Our net revenue margins will expand or contract largely based on how the market varies from what we were expecting going into these contracts. And the expectations with these contracts are very localized, very decentralized on a customer-specific basis. So that's, as I said earlier, it gets difficult to predict what we think will happen to our net revenue margins. As we shared through October, as 2015 comes to an end, we know that we will probably have some continuation of the net revenue margin expansion in the fourth quarter, just because of where we're at in the marketplace. 2016 gets a lot more challenging to predict.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. Can you discuss freight volume trends as the third quarter progressed and thus far in October?","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. They were pretty consistent throughout the quarter. It's what we discussed. Towards the end, there was kind of a slowing of that growth rate towards the end of the quarter. In October, what we're seeing is volumes are still up, but, again, it's up \u2013 that growth rate has decreased from where it was in the third quarter.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Okay. Thanks, Andy. The next question is for John. You've been able to grow operating income faster than net income for a few quarters in a row now, which is a nice trend. Are there things that you're doing different to amplify the leverage in the model, and how much more is there to go and how sustainable do you think that it is?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I touched on this briefly earlier, but I think, from a big-picture standpoint, if you rewind to three years ago, we divested of T-Chek, which was perhaps our highest operating margin business; we acquired Phoenix Global Forwarding business, where best-in-class is lower operating margins, and then we had some purchase accounting from that acquisition that, all combined, had a pretty significant impact in that operating income to net revenue metric. While that didn't feel good in 2012, we thought it was the right thing to do for the long-term in that we would be able to integrate and improve the operating margins of our legacy forwarding business and really kind of use the combined scale to continue to improve that service offering which, in fact, has happened. T-Chek has cycled out of the comparisons, and we've been able to leverage some of our technology investments, just to continue to improve the efficiency of the service offering that we acquired there.","So, as I kind of laid out earlier, there's a few other subscale areas where we think we have more opportunity to grow, but we also, as I mentioned, feel that we're best in class and that we want to remain sensitive to making sure that we balance growth initiatives and investment with the productivity and profitability initiatives that we have.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Okay thanks, John. Next question for Andy. At what point does the health of the truckload market have a negative effect on your net revenue margin? Is it just a matter of there being a lag between the buy rate and the sell rate? If the cost of transportation is expected to continue to decrease, would you expect the sell rate to follow to the same degree?\"","Andrew C. Clarke - Chief Financial Officer","I think, as John mentioned earlier in the comments in the Q&A, if you look since 2010, those rates have risen on average over 4%. And we're signing on new truckload carriers every day, 3,000 in the last quarter. So I'm not sure, in terms of the subject of the question, if the assumption is that truckload market is unhealthy. I would tell you that pricing, what we've seen on average, is an increase in truckload pricing and that varies depending on the cyclicality, where we are in the cycle, what quarter we're in. It bounces up, it bounces down. But we think that the expectation is that you look out there across any different industry research report, quite frankly, we think prices are going to continue to rise.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John on the Global business. How sluggish is the activity in China and what's the factor on your volume outlook?","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, as we've talked in our Global Forwarding business, our number one corridor is Transpacific Eastbound and we are the number one NVOCC from China to the U.S. So the deceleration or the decline in the growth rate of shipments out of China does have an impact on our expectation of ocean volumes, particularly from China to the U.S. However, even though we're proud of our market share and our scale and the improvements we've made there, we still represent a single-digit market share in terms of the activity that's going and the market in China is still growing, even though it's not growing at the pace that it was before.","So, if you put those two things together, it's still a growing market and we still have a lot of market share opportunity to go after and we feel like we have some pretty compelling value propositions to go to the marketplace with. So, while it clearly has an impact and is material to a lot of the things in the world, it doesn't really dampen our excitement around the ability to grow our Global Forwarding business.","Timothy D. Gagnon - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics","Thanks, John. So I think we've been able to cover the primary topics that were sent to us in the questions last night and early this morning.","If you have any follow-up that you'd like from Andy, John, or myself please reach out to me and I'd be happy to schedule some time for us to talk further.","I'd like to thank everybody for participating in the call this morning and remind you that there will be a replay available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And you can get access to that by dialing 888-203-1112 and entering the pass code 359696 and that replay will be available through November 4.","Again, if you have any additional questions or would like follow-up please call me, Tim Gagnon, at 952-683-5007 or via e-mail at tim.gagnon@chrobinson.com.","Thank you, everybody. Have a great day."],"4187":["CH Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW) Q2 2014 Earnings Call July 30, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Tim Gagnon - Director of Investor Relations and Analytics","John P. Wiehoff - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President","Chad M. Lindbloom - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Senior Vice President","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Tim Gagnon will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, July 30, 2014.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, Director of Investor Relations.","Tim Gagnon","Thank you, and good morning, everybody. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, Chief Executive Officer; and Chad Lindbloom, Chief Financial Officer. John and Chad will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our second quarter, and we'll follow that with a response to pre-submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday.","Please note there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate our discussion. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Chad will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments.","I'd like to remind you that comments made by John, Chad or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","With that, I'll turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments on Slide 3 with a review of our second quarter 2014 results.","John P. Wiehoff","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everybody. Referencing those second quarter results on Page 3, as Tim mentioned, a quick review of our key financial metrics for the quarter. Our total revenues grew 6.5% in the second quarter compared to the previous year. Net revenues grew 10.2% compared to 2013. Income from operations were up 9.8% and net income increased 6%.","At the EPS line item, our results were $0.80 earnings per share compared to $0.70 in the prior year, which represents a 14% increase. When you look at our overall results for the quarter, with the higher growth rate in EPS and additional interest expense that came from the capital structure, share repurchase transaction that we described a year ago, you see some of those results impacting our results in the second quarter.","In terms of overall reaction to our second quarter results, we were pleased with them. 2014 started out with some pretty challenging weather and an environment that was difficult to execute. But as the year has progressed and getting through the mid-point here, we do feel like we're executing with the goals that we set out for at the beginning of the year, which was really to adapt to those changing market conditions and some significant price adjustments that are occurring. Also, to leverage our existing network and investments that we've made over the last couple of years, both organically and our surface transportation, as well as the investments in acquisitions and global forwarding.","So it was a clean quarter representing entirely organic growth. Not a lot of unusual or different items. And I guess our sense, overall, we're proud of our company, we're proud of the execution, and we think the results were pretty good for Q2. Because it's a more straightforward cleaner quarter, we're going to go through the deck a little bit quicker than we have the past couple of quarters and get to some of the Q&A that we think is more helpful during this period.","Moving on then to Slide 4, with our overall transportation results. Transportation total revenues increased 7.8% for the quarter and net revenues were up 12.2%. On this page, we look at our overall transportation net revenue margin, which improved to 15.9% and represents a 60 basis point improvement from the first quarter of this year, as well as a 60 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2013.","As we've talked in past periods, there's a lot going on, on this schedule in terms of the historical information that we provide. This represents the aggregate net revenue margin for all of our different transportation services, so there are mixed issues, as well as seasonal and secular changes that impact all of them. But we do believe that it's helpful to look at our business from a long-term perspective and look at these aggregate margins to understand what's happening in the entirety of how we're managing our customers' transportation services.","From there though, I will move on and talk a little bit more specifically about the individual transportation modes that make that up. So moving to Slide 5 with our truckload results for Q2 of 2014. Truckload net revenues increased 15.6% in the second quarter with volume increasing 4%. North America truckload volume grew approximately 3%. The net revenue margins in truckload did increase from last year in the second quarter, and it was largely a result of a change in the mix of our business with more shorter length haul freight and an improved pricing environment that's summarized in the upper right hand on the slide that shows that our approximate pricing per mile to customers increased 10%, while our approximate cost of hire per mile for the quarter increased around 9%.","In terms of the overall truckload capacity in the quarter, I guess, our aggregate summation is that during the second quarter of 2014, when we look at our route guide depth and other metrics that we would focus on to understand the tightness of capacity and the overall market conditions in truckload, we did have -- we do believe that the truckload market was tighter in the second quarter of 2014 compared to a year ago, but not quite as tight or difficult to find capacity as it was in the first quarter of 2014. So a little bit of sequential easing in the tightness of the truckload market, but still higher than a year ago in a fairly tight market condition.","Moving on to Slide 6 with our LTL results for Q2 of 2014. Net revenues increased 11% in the quarter, while volumes increased approximately 8%. That growth represents a mixture of growth from both existing accounts and new customers during the quarter. Also, when we look at the metrics around our LTL business, we did experience a growth in the size of our shipments. The average size shipment in our LTL business, as well as a small increase in the length of haul for our LTL shipments. Both of those do help with our net revenue margins.","Another information point that we wanted to report to you is that in our carrier discussions and business reviews and pricing discussions, that there was more data points this quarter around cost issues, driver shortages and capacity availability in the LTL market than we've seen over the quarters. As everybody knows, those capacity shortages and driver challenges have been very prevalent in the truckload side for the last couple of years, so we did not intend to call this out as being different or abnormal from that, but just recognizing that the resource shortages, the driver shortages, we feel more impact in our LTL business around that today than we have in the past. And it's very consistent with the truckload portion.","Moving then to Slide 7 in our intermodal results. Intermodal net revenue for the quarter increased 9.5%. Volume was up approximately 1%. As we've talked many times in the past, our intermodal business is much more integrated into our truck offering, so that we see freight that moves back and forth between truck and rail, depending upon market conditions and pricing.","Others have talked and the industry has talked about some of the service issues that were weather and otherwise provoked in the different rail services, so we did see some activity moving more towards truckload service preferences, which did, we believe, impact our volume growth for intermodal in the quarter. The net revenue growth of 9.5% on 1% volume really, similar to our other transportation services, is largely a result of a better load selection and better pricing and lane management in our intermodal operations.","Moving then to Slide 8, our global forwarding, international, air, ocean and customs brokerage results for the second quarter. Ocean net revenues were up 2.8% in the quarter. Air increased 7.6% and customs brokerage services were up 5.6%. If you put them all together in our global forwarding business, it represented a 4.4% increase in the net revenues over the second quarter of 2013.","If you look at the volume, pricing, margin metrics that are laid out on the bottom of Slide 8, it really shows consistency between the first and second quarter with regards to our activity around volume and pricing. We're on the ocean side of it. We continue to see price increases, but margin compression due to excess supply in the marketplace. On the air side, as has been well publicized, again, continued challenges from an overall pricing standpoint compared to a year ago. Our net revenue margin improvement was largely driven by better operations, better execution on consolidation and some of the operational issues that drive air margins.","We did call out on that slide that there's a significant uncertainty in our global forwarding business around the West Coast. Labor negotiations, that's obviously very important to us, given our significant presence in the trans-Pacific eastbound. Our business is continuing to function as normal, but just with the uncertainty, that's an area of our business where we're staying very close to and making sure that we're ready to react given anything else unusual occurring.","I'd say the overall message on global forwarding is very similar to what we've said the last couple of quarters, that our integration has run its course. We've got some lingering things to kind of work on, but a couple of years into putting 2 pretty meaningful global forwarding businesses together. We continue to be very proud of the fact that every single quarter, we've had an increase in the net revenue and that our integration plan is working. And that we're growing our global forwarding business in accordance with the plan that we set out when we made the Phoenix acquisition.","We are continuing to focus our efforts more increasingly on cross-selling and trying to ramp-up that growth rate, but the most important thing in the first couple of years was to create a stable foundation and a durable long-term global forwarding business that we feel very good about what we've created.","Moving then to Slide 9, on our other logistic services. This net revenue represents the combination of both our transportation management services, as well as our various other logistics revenues. For the second quarter of 2014, the management -- transportation management services net revenue increased, again, but that was offset by declines in some of the miscellaneous logistics services categories.","Moving to Slide 10 in our Sourcing results for Q2. Our Sourcing net revenues decreased 10% in the first quarter of 2014. Overall, in terms of our Sourcing results, I think the message is consistent with what we've talked about the last couple of quarters that we continue to experience some business that's transitioned away from us, primarily with one significant customer. In addition to that, there are some pretty significant West Coast drought conditions that are impacting the level of planting and crop availability that are impacting the business.","The other callout that we have on this slide is that many of you may have seen press releases or heard during the second quarter of 2014 that we did launch a pretty significant rebranding effort in our produce business, under the Robinson Fresh label. Over the decades, as we've operated under different commodities, we've had a variety of different brands that we go to market with, and while some of those will stay in place, this was a meaningful effort to really sort of highlight and emphasize our expertise in fresh produce and put an umbrella brand over the top of it to really try to integrate better and do all of our commodities in a more coordinated way. So that was a significant effort during the quarter that we thought went well, and if you see or hear initiatives around it, it's really not so much a change in strategy of our business model, but really a marketing and branding effort around how we're going to market and clarifying the offerings and expertise that we have in produce.","With that, I will turn it over to Chad for some comments on our income statement.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Thanks, John. As John mentioned, I will begin my comments on Slide 11 with our summarized income statement for the second quarter. As John mentioned earlier, our total net revenues grew 10%. Personnel expenses increased 16% in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2013. Our bonus, restricted stock and under performance-based compensation expenses drove 10% growth in total personnel expense, and the remainder was due primarily to a 4% increase in average heads compared to last year's second quarter. Although we have kept headcount relatively flat with -- beyond the 2013, we are growing, as I mentioned, over the second quarter of 2013.","SG&A expenses decreased 2.9% in Q2, primarily the -- which is primarily the result of $5 million contingent auto liability claim that was in last year's second quarter. Excluding this item, SG&A expenses would have increased 3%. The biggest increase in SG&A was our provision for doubtful accounts. This increased expense was primarily the result of the growth of our total receivable portfolio and a slight deterioration of our aging. We do feel good about the overall quality of our receivables in our current reserve level.","Total operating expenses increased 10.5%, which is a blend of those 2 above, and income from operations increased 9.8%. Our operating income, as a percent of net revenue, decreased slightly in the quarter compared to last year's second quarter to 38.5% from 38.6%. As a reminder, we talked about last year the impacts of the Phoenix acquisition. Just slightly over -- just folding in a lower operating margin business impacts our income from operations of about 1%, and the amortization that came with the acquisition is about another 1% impact to our income from operations.","Moving on to Slide 13 -- or Slide 12, I'm sorry, the other financial information slide. We had a strong cash flow quarter with income -- or cash flow from operations approximating net income, which is an internal benchmark we use. CapEx was relatively low for the quarter, partially due to timing. We still expect our total CapEx for the year to be around $40 million. Our balance sheet and capital structure remains relatively consistent with previous quarters, and our total debt balance was $900 million, with $400 million drawn on our revolver.","During the quarter, we returned a total of approximately $104 million of cash to our shareholders through our ongoing dividend and $51 million worth of share repurchase activity. We repurchased 844,900 shares at an average price of $60.83.","With that, I'll turn it back to John to talk about on outlook.","John P. Wiehoff","So on Slide 13, the bullet points are regarding a look ahead, the comments that we would like to share about our forward thinking before we turn it over to the Q&A. The first one, really, over the last 2 or 3 years, when we've interacted with shareholders and analysts, probably the most common topical themes have been trying to understand the cyclical versus secular forces that are impacting our business and how they're changing.","I think we've pretty consistently answered that question that there are both types of impacts that are impacting our business. And I think one of the things that we felt in this quarter was that, more so than in a long time, it was very evident that both of those were there. If you look at the fluctuations in our results and the fluctuation in our margins, we've talked a lot in the past about supply and demand and how those margins will fluctuate, have fluctuated, and that we would expect that to continue into the future.","If you look at our results, particularly in the truckload arena, there are some very meaningful cyclical fluctuations around capacity, availability and pricing that have been consistent in our business for many decades, and we expect that to continue going forward.","At the same time, we've been very open and many of you have observed and agree that it is a different industry today than it was 5 years ago or any time in the past. The competition is alive and well. Technology is making a bigger impact. Maybe as we've said in the past, most importantly, I think shippers' attitudes towards supply chain and the balance around growth efficiency is maybe a little bit different today than it has been at any point in the past. And it's clearly a more global setting and focus than we've had before, too.","So when we look at our business and try to understand our results, I think that's, maybe first and foremost, the reality that we realized we're in a different world today and that we have to manage differently and that there are some forces that will continue to be challenged by, and at the same time, there is a very traditional cyclical element to our business.","Our second point. What we'd like to do is share the factual information that we have, given the difficulties of predicting or guiding that we've talked about so often in the past. What we do know, the most information is about our North America truckload business and end of July, our net revenue growth rate has been similar to the second quarter. And that just really continues to be driven primarily by margin improvement with more minimal volume growth in July.","The third bullet point around -- I already touched a little bit around continuing to focus on both growth and efficiency. As we get into the Q&A, and we've discussed before, that's terminology that we've been using for more than a decade to talk about and discuss strategically around how we try to grow the business and go after market share gains and expand our services, but that we're constantly balancing that with our efficiency, productivity and profitability. That's very important to creating the shareholder value as well too. We feel like our culture is pretty good and pretty balanced around those 2 topics. They've both been part of our core, part of our culture and part of our strategy for many decades.","And we will continue to do that with evaluating the market environment for each of our services, making coaching decisions to our network around pricing and what the environment feels like in terms of opportunities to go after share versus profitability. Continue to operate in a heavily decentralized environment where our account managers use that guidance and that data, but have a lot of autonomy to do what's right for their customer to serve them and adapt to the local market in a way that's appropriate.","Lastly, just reemphasizing again, when we look at what's going on in Robinson, separate from our Q2 results, we laid out a long-term growth strategy in our Investor Day last fall, where we talked about our revised growth plans and the things that we were investing in. And one message we wanted to convey is that we continue to feel that, that's an accurate assessment of a reasonable goal for the future. And what we talked about a lot in that is the investments that we're making in the areas of technology with our Navisphere platform, how important that becomes to our service offering and how significant the investments are that we're making to continue to keep that a competitive advantage in the services that we offer.","Global expansion with the investment in Phoenix and the investment in European truckload services, we continue to push heavily to invest in a more global platform. Those are decisions that we feel very good about. The return on those investments will continue to come more into the future as there's been a lot of investment and cost associated in the past with them. But globalizing the business is something that we take very important and expanding our network and our footprint around the globe is an important part of our long-term strategy.","Last and not least, this is a people business, and we are spending and investing as heavily as ever around our workforce and our talent development with -- investing in training and making sure that our account management and our people are being educated and supported with resources and the go-to-market initiatives as effectively as we can to do that.","So those are probably 3 areas of the areas that we talked a lot about in the past, but just want to highlight them again, that we continued to make what we believe are very meaningful investments in each of those areas to position ourselves for continued success in the future.","Those are our prepared comments on the quarter. With that, I'll turn it back to Tim to facilitate the prepared Q&A for the quarter that was submitted.","Question-and-Answer Session","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. And as I get into the questions here and John and Chad will provide answers, I'd first like to thank the many analysts, investors for taking the time to submit questions. We really appreciate a lot of good questions. We'll get right into that now. The first question is for John. And the question reads, how realistic is it to experience 10-plus percent net revenue growth and not have to add significant costs? How are you managing that balance right now?","John P. Wiehoff","This question goes back in our lens to the balance between growth and efficiency. We talked about, at the beginning of the year, that for several years in a row, we had invested in our North American surface network at a rate of headcount that exceeded our volume growth for probably a 3-year period of time, as we were pretty aggressively going after share in a very balanced market condition. We also talked about in our global forwarding business that when we did our integration strategy and put the 2 businesses together, that our strategy was to retain all people from both organizations, knowing that there were opportunities to grow into that bigger infrastructure. And hopefully, leverage the productivity opportunities in the future after the acquisition. And lastly, with the known transition away of some of the Sourcing business that we felt the resources that we had in place there would be adequate to reassign and to grow that Sourcing business. So when we think about the cyclical evolution and all the changes in our business coming into 2014, we believe that we could leverage our network, continue to go after some of the process improvements and synergies to work together, and really try to harvest some return on those past investments that we made. Our long-term growth strategy has not changed that we do believe that attracting and training and developing talent is one of the most important core competencies that we have. And our longer-term strategy and plan that we laid out last year would have us growing our headcount much more proportionate to our net revenues in the long term. So the results that we had in the second quarter were very much in line with what we were targeting and hoping for at the beginning of the year. That reflects much more of a 2014 strategy and approach to the current market condition and our past investment activity. Coming into 2015 and going forward, we would expect to continue to go after those productivity initiatives and leveraging our network, but that headcount increases would likely correlate much more to our longer-term net revenue expectations.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. Second question is for Chad. Truckload net revenue was up almost 16%. The rest of each of the company's divisions, net revenue grew slower than that rate causing overall company net revenue to be up 10%. Why would personnel expense for the whole company be up 16% if the largest category of net revenue or 16% -- 60% of the company was up the most at just shy of 16%? Even with 4% headcount growth, the remaining 12%, driven by variable compensation exceeds the total company net revenue growth? I would have thought there would have been a higher operating contribution margin on these incremental net revenues.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Thanks, Tim. As I mentioned in my remarks, our average headcount in the second quarter was up 4% compared to last year's second quarter. Our incentive compensation drove an increase of 10% to total compensation expense during the quarter, with the balance made up of salaries and other increases, the 2%. Last year, we discussed that many of our growth-based bonus and equity programs had 0 expense, due to the lack of earnings growth. We mentioned during that time that once earnings started to grow again, these plans could cause our personnel expense to grow faster than our net revenues, but stated that would be a good problem to have. That is indeed happening. Our compensation programs and practices have stayed consistent. Our earnings are growing, and we have experienced personnel expenses growing faster than net revenues. We still feel good about the overall variability of our cost structure. We expect fluctuations to continue and our cost as a percentage in net revenue. As we discussed earlier during the call, we are constantly managing to balance growth and efficiency initiatives.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks, Chad. The next question is about competition and it reads, some competitors seem to be branching out into other services beyond just freight brokerage. Do you feel the need to add any additional services as you look strategically into the future to complement your already strong service offering?","John P. Wiehoff","We do believe that one of the most important strategic decisions that any transportation company, especially a third party one like us, makes is around what the scope of services will be. And it is clear that, especially over the last decade, that as shippers have looked at more of an integrated supply chain and an integrated transportation service, that having the wherewithal and perspective on the various options in the marketplace is an important component of how you go to market. So yes, we do feel some marketplace pressure and opportunity to continue to look at the scope of services and to make sure that we have a broad offering and can interface with our customer in a way that makes sense to them. When you think about the universe of third-party logistics or logistics and supply chain opportunities, if you -- where I like to think of Robinson being on that continuum is that we do focus, and have focused, very heavily on broadening our transportation service offerings. The investments in less-than-truckload and intermodal and freight forwarding and European transportation. And in addition to that, when we go beyond transportation, a lot of our emphasis has been on transportation management services and the technology associated with that kind of bundled transportation offering. So from our standpoint, the way we've been responding to that competitive landscape is by expanding our services and focusing on a more global offering, focusing in on the various modes of transportation that we see as highly interchangeable with each other around consolidations and routing and mode selection and all the rest of that, and all of the different consultative and technology services that would come with that. Obviously, there's a lot of things around procurement and inventory that you can go even broader within the supply chain that we continue to look for opportunities or see what makes sense there. But I think it is important, too, to, at least from our point of view, that probably the most important thing is in that menu of services and scope of offering that you go to the marketplace with, that you do have the ability to actually integrate them and to perform the execution and operations in a world-class manner. Just having a broader menu of services doesn't do much for you. I think you have to be competitive with each of them and really know how they work together in order to be effective with them. So that's probably how we would sum up our strategy around the competitive landscape and the scope of services, and how we continue to look at what makes sense for us in our go-to market and how we think we can best compete.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. Next question is for Chad. How much additional expense is being incurred related to bonus accrual on a year-over-year basis and versus 1Q '14?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Thanks, Tim. I think I'm going to broaden the question slightly to talk about our incentive compensation, which we include our bonuses, commissions, performance-based equity and profit-sharing expenses in our definition of variable or incentive compensation. As I mentioned in the last question I answered and in my prepared remarks, the increases in these expenses drove a 10% increase in overall personnel expense or approximately $21 million of additional expense in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the second quarter of 2013.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks, Chad. The next question for John, again, around competition. Can you discuss the current competitive environment in the truck brokerage market? And are you concerned about other participants being willing to do the same business for a significantly smaller margin going forward?","John P. Wiehoff","So we've discussed in the past that the market, by our perspective, is more competitive today versus 10 years ago, not necessarily in the number of competitors because there always has been 10,000-plus brokerage licenses and third-party competitors. The real difference being that there's many more substantial companies today and many more companies that are aggressively going after share and scale to try to compete in the truck brokerage section. So it is a more competitive market. That's part of how things are changing in our industry. With regards to kind of our perspective or concerns around margins, I think, really, what that sort of speaks to is pricing strategies. I think there's probably a couple of subsets to it. One is to the extent that some competitors appear or seem to be taking the strategy of trying to buy market share or take less margin in order to get scale. That's certainly one element that we have to pay attention to around is that sustainable or what is the right kind of pricing opportunity there. The other thing that I -- that we focus on a lot and the industry has, too, really, is around the pricing sophistication and segmentation. Those contractual customers and the pricing that's appropriate with it versus how the market might be moving and all the discussions we've had over the last couple of quarters around when the market moves significantly like it has, how and when is it appropriate to renegotiate your annual contracts and how do you adapt to a transactional market and balance both of those components. So in this increasing competitive market, I think it really kind of comes down to segmentation strategies and pricing strategies and making certain that we feel good and confident about our returns, our pricing disciplines and our long-term returns on the business that we're going after. And we do spend more time observing and analyzing competitor behavior around pricing to make certain that we're doing the right thing for our shareholders.","Tim Gagnon","Thank you, John. The next question for Chad. Can you give us a sense for what the net revenue trend looked like throughout the months of the second quarter, and how you would expect it to play out in the third quarter? Did it pick up or lose momentum as we progress throughout the quarter? How should we think about this against the backdrop of minimal volume growth in July? What's behind that?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Sure. On a per business day basis, our consolidated net revenue growth was stronger in May and June than it was during April. That same trend was true for our North American truckload business. Our North America truckload net revenue margins expanded at an increasing rate as the quarter progressed. That comparison is based on comparing each month of the quarter to 2013 months. Sequentially, month-to-month, our net revenue margins did not expand during the second quarter of 2014 as it is normal for June to have the lowest net revenue margin of any other month during the second quarter due to seasonality. On a per business day basis, our volume growth was slightly lower in June than the quarter as a whole. That trend has continued into July. We are continuing to be selective with the transactional opportunities that we commit to in repricing our contractual business based on current market conditions. As we have mentioned in the past, every time we adjust pricing upward, we risk losing the business. While we have continued to grow volumes with new opportunities and expanded our relationships with many customers, we have lost some business through our pricing disciplines. Overall, we feel very confident that -- about these activities and feel that we're doing what's best for the long-term interest of the company and the shareholders.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, Chad. And the next question again for you, on negative loads. Can you give us a sense for how your negative loads have been trending relative to the first quarter and last year? You mentioned that they were elevated in the first quarter. Did you see an easing of that in the second quarter? Have you been successful renegotiating more contracts with customers to pass along your higher purchase transportation costs?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Sure. Part of that question is repetitive with the previous question, but I'll answer primarily about the negative loads now. We mentioned on our first quarter call that our negative loads, or loads where we lost money, were extremely high during the first quarter. During the second quarter, our loads -- loser loads fell sequentially, but were up slightly compared to last year's second quarter. In the second quarter of 2014, our loser loads returned to a range that we consider normal compared to other second quarters. Normally, June is the month that we have the greatest frequency of loser loads. June 2014 has the highest ratio of these loser loads compared to any other month, so far, in 2014. On a positive note though, June 2014 had a smaller ratio of loser loads compared to June of 2013. We believe that this is further evidenced that we are being appropriately disciplined in our pricing practices.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, Chad. Next question for John about the routing guide. Is the route guide still at elevated levels, despite being lower than first quarter, probably?","John P. Wiehoff","So this question really ties into the truckload capacity and the comments around the tightness in the marketplace. There's a variety of metrics that we would look at to reach the conclusion around how tight or how difficult it is to source capacity when we assess the marketplace. We look at a number of things and have conversations with carriers to understand that around pricing. Route guide metrics are one of the important metrics, which is for those customers that have automated processes for determining which carrier gets the shipment. In our vocabulary, the higher or elevated those route guides are our reflective of the fact that shippers had to more frequently go to multiple carriers to find capacity and get routed. So those route guide metrics did remain higher in the second quarter of this year compared to a year ago, but did ease some off of the first quarter where the weather was really probably causing some accentuated spikes in the difficulty of sourcing capacity. So the route guide metrics do support the conclusion that I stated earlier around it's still being a relatively tight truckload marketplace, but some easing compared to the first quarter.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. The next question again for you. In the past, you've talked about your long-term growth goal of growing volumes and gaining market share. CHRW has been focusing on margin improvement and efficiencies since late 2013. When do you plan to grow volumes market share again? And would you be willing to allow net revenue margin to move lower in order to grow share?","John P. Wiehoff","I started to talk about this a little bit earlier around that tug-of-war between growth and efficiency and how we have in the past, and will continue to, adjust to market conditions by balancing those 2 forces. Obviously, depending upon the marketplace and competition, we'll try to find the optimum balance of growing our business and accepting the right sort of margins that the market will give us around that. So the short answer to the question is yes, if we have to, we will tolerate some margin compression in order to get growth in our services. In the long-term strategy that we laid out in that investor deck and when we look back over the last 3 or 4 decades, the market share gains and the growth in the company are an incredibly important part of the foundation, and what we need to continue to do to succeed. So we will be aggressive going after those market share gains in the long term like we have in the past. Exactly when will we do that? I think that's an ongoing topic that we literally discuss weekly around here, around what's happening in the market condition, how are our productivity levels. While we talk on these calls about top-down guidance and direction around our thoughts for the year, that's certainly true and we do that. And our network supervisors will be working with each of our offices to figure out what makes sense around those decisions. But we do already have offices that are investing more aggressively in growth, depending upon what their opportunities are and how they're adapting. And I think as this year wears on and going into next year, you'll see more aggregate activity around that type of investment.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. The next question is for Chad. CHRW plans to increase the return of cash to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks. Can you provide the framework you plan to use? What dividend payout ratio are you targeting? How much debt are you comfortable with, either measured by debt to EBITDA or debt to capitalization?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Sure. Our capital management philosophy is consistent with what we outlined at our Investor Day last November. We target returning about 90% of our annual net income to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. This is not a commitment to do that every year or every quarter, but is our overall philosophy. If we have other needs for capital generated by our earnings, like increases in working capital or acquisitions, the amount of cash returned to shareholders may be reduced from time to time. Our current targeted dividend payout ratio is 45%. We are managing the ongoing returns of capital to shareholders to maintain a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 1:1.5. For the right acquisition opportunity, we feel that it would be prudent to go to 2.5x EBITDA for total debt balance. We currently have covenants that limit our debt to capitalization to 0.65.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, Chad. The next question again for you. What was the amount of bad debt provisions in second quarter of '14 and second quarter of '13?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Our provision for doubtful accounts was $4.9 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared to $3.3 million in last year's second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this increase was primarily due to the increase in the size of the receivable portfolio. The increase in the size of the receivable portfolio was driven primarily by our growth in gross revenues.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks, Chad. Next question for John on global forwarding strategy. Given the sluggish international air and ocean freight forwarding trends, how is Phoenix performing relative to expectations and their ability to attract new business? Where also do we stand on the integration?","John P. Wiehoff","When we looked at the Phoenix acquisition -- it's coming up on almost 2 years ago now that we closed that deal -- we had a lot of discussion about the industry and the excess capacity, margin compression, where would things go. In terms of our return on investment and valuation assumptions when we made that investment, we felt strongly about the cultural fit and the scale of opportunities and the longer-term synergies that would come from that. A couple of years into it, we are achieving our base case scenarios and we're happy with the return around the investment and we feel like our integration plan is on track, as I mentioned earlier, a couple of years into it. I think at acquisition time, and since then, we've also commented that really the upside and perhaps the most potent synergy around the acquisition would be the cross-selling opportunity and really the revenue synergies of stronger growth that, hopefully, can come from tapping into the domestic and international customer basis and exposing broader transportation services to them. As we talked on the last couple of calls, because of the integration strategy, we really didn't start to push that more aggressively until this year. And we do hope to continue that over the next several years. We've had some early successes, but not enough to really move the needle in terms of our overall net revenue growth rate. But I think our team feels very optimistic about the offering that we have and the go-to-market strategy and the account management practices to execute that in the future. So the overall reaction is we're on track with our integration. We are achieving the base case scenario of the valuation assumptions, and we feel very good about the investment. We did not quantify or attempt to value the revenue synergies and the longer-term real benefit that could come above and beyond that, and we're aggressively going after that today in what is difficult market conditions. So hopefully, at some point in the future, we'll be able to get a little bit more support and tailwind from the market conditions to help achieve that. But despite what we've seen in the last couple of years, we feel very good about the investment.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks John. The next question is for Chad. Excluding the auto settlement in second quarter of '13, your operating expenses were up 12.5% year-over-year, which is an acceleration versus the growth rate seen in the first quarter and below the 10.2% net revenue growth. Were there any onetime expenses in the quarter that inflated operating expenses? If not, would you expect operating expense growth to mirror net revenue growth for the remainder of the year?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Okay. We've already spent a lot of time -- that number combines both personnel expense and other SG&A. We've already spent a lot of time answering the personnel expense questions. So excluding the $5 million auto liability claim in the second quarter of 2013, our non-personnel SG&A expenses grew approximately 3%. Our provision for doubtful accounts was the biggest part of that increase, and we also mentioned in the earnings release that we have lower travel and entertainment expenses during the quarter compared to last year's second quarter. As far as what will the expenses do in the future, we believe that they will continue to fluctuate. But adjusting for just the onetime unusual item of last year that this year's second quarter, the comparison isn't directly comparable, but it is a good ongoing run rate and there is no unusual items in the second quarter of this year.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks, Chad. The next question again for you. On Page 5 of your deck, you mentioned changes in business mix. What more can you say about that?","Chad M. Lindbloom","That is our truckload slide. And the primary change in mix in our truckload business that is impacting the change in our price and cost per mile, which was what the bullet point was about, is that we are hauling more short-haul freight. The shorter the length of haul, the higher the rate is on a per mile basis. Similar to last quarter, our committed rates on long-haul van freight were up in the low- to mid-single digits. The 10% increase in our overall customer rates, excluding the estimate impacts of fuel, is driven by a combination of this increase in short-haul freight and a robust spot freight market. Our spot rates grew in the low-teens.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, Chad. And one more for you here. What should we expect for tax rate in share count for the remainder of the year? How -- has management's 2014 CapEx guidance changed?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Okay. Thanks, Tim. We expect our tax rate to fluctuate between 38.5% and 39%. Our share count in the future will depend on the amount of cash we generate and the share price. We will continue to follow the capital management practices that we outlined earlier in this call. We still believe that our CapEx, including capitalized and purchased software, will be around $40 million. Previously, we had guided to a range of $40 million to $45 million, but we feel we may be on the low side of that range for 2014.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, Chad. And the next question is for John related to M&A. With several large M&A deals recently in the domestic asset light logistic space, are you considering some larger scale acquisitions? It would seem to be better use of financial prowess than share repurchases.","John P. Wiehoff","With regards to our philosophy or attitude towards mergers and acquisitions, I think, when you look around our industry and other industries, you see some competitors that are focused entirely on organic growth and don't look at acquisitions. And you also see companies that are very aggressively acquiring or rolling off a lot of businesses in the space. For us and our culture, I think you can create value anywhere on that continuum. But what we have always believed in and continue to execute is that we want to be predominantly an organic-growth company that has very tight integrated offerings and very high customer service experience. So we are open to acquisitions of all size, always have been, and we'll continue to explore those. When we acquired Phoenix a couple of years ago, that was a pretty large effort for us. And we said at the time that we were going to focus very heavily on completely integrating that and really making it a seamless component of our offering. As I commented earlier, we're pretty much over with that. There's some clean up to do, but it probably falls more in the range of sort of ongoing things that we have for any of our different service offerings. So at this point, we do feel comfortable that in our exploration of the marketplace, if another opportunity comes along, really, of any size, we're definitely interested. We continue to have what we believe is a higher filter of strategic fit, cultural fit and valuation discipline that drives a more limited selection of the number of deals that we're going to do. But for us, at least on that continuum of choices of how to deploy our capital, we feel we have a good balance of where the right acquisition makes sense. It probably does have the highest ROI for us, but that we don't want to mess with our high service offering and our integrated service offering by doing too many. And so that, from a capital deployment standpoint, share repurchases have, by far, the lowest risk and they're quick and easy to execute. And we'll continue to do those to make sure that we're fair with our capital structure along the way.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. The next question is again for you, on the intermodal strategy. Is intermodal a priority when you think about acquisitions outside of adding more containers or buying an established player? How do you think about increasing your presence in the intermodal market, given its pretty favorable secular growth characteristics?","John P. Wiehoff","Intermodal is a priority for many of the reasons that I articulated earlier around integrated transportation offerings and really thinking about the scope of what we go to market with. We are a top 5 intermodal provider with all of the railroads in North America, and do feel good about the presence that we have today. We also know that we don't have the same density and scale as some of the largest competitors so that there is an opportunity to continue to improve there. Absent a significant investment or a merger and acquisition opportunity, the core challenge kind of comes down to the account management disciplines with our customers and with the railroads to make sure that we stay relevant and a part of their go-to-market strategy around the freight that they want to go after. So it's really about either using pooled equipment or our own equipment to make sure that we're going after growth opportunities that our rail partners would support. It includes getting better and more dense range [ph] offerings, which are a huge part of the competitive landscape. And maybe most importantly, just making certain that we're interfacing with our customers and exposing intermodal services and intermodal opportunities, where it's most appropriate, to their book of business to make sure that we stay relevant in that and continue to grow. So there are a lot of things that we've done in the past that are under our control that we can continue to do to invest and grow our intermodal business. And our attitude is that it is a priority and that we will make whatever investments we need to in order to grow that service and make sure that it stays an important part of our integrated transportation offering.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. The next question again for you, on sourcing. When can we expect to lap the dedicated customer loss in your sourcing business and see that segment return to growth?","John P. Wiehoff","I think we've talked about in the past that in all of our larger customer relationships, there are multiple commodities or categories and the transition of the business that's going away began in the last half of 2013. So it will be the last half of 2014 where we'll see the cycle through of the lost business. In our sourcing business, we've also talked about the drought conditions and some of the other challenges that we've had just because of difficulties in the produce industry that without that lost customer business, that the remainder of our produce business is down slightly the last couple of quarters. So the lost business will cycle through, and we would return to more longer-term growth expectations with sort of that overarching caveat that there are some pretty material weather issues going on. And that, hopefully, those will stabilize and provide a rebound opportunity or some greater growth options going for us. But just from a pure analytical standpoint, the lost business that we know about for sure will cycle out in the second half of 2014. And 2015 would, hopefully, be a year that we go into with more typical long-term growth expectations.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks, John. The next question is again for you. How is business in Canada, Mexico and Europe shaping up? Are your expectations being met in these foreign countries?","John P. Wiehoff","So from the standpoint of our North America surface transportation network, we don't talk a lot about calling out Canada and Mexico because they are an integrated part of that network, but we are very proud of our presence in both of those countries. We have 6 or 7 offices in each of Canada and Mexico, and have grown them significantly over the last 5 to 7 years. I feel very good about our service capabilities and offerings there. And how it is tied into a North America service offering, including the border services that the trucks need access to when they cross. So Canada and Mexico are very much an important part of our growth strategy in an integrated North America surface offering, and we feel very good. We've been at it in both of those locations for more than 30 years and have a pretty strong presence there. With regards to Europe, that's been more of a 20-year investment cycle of the surface transportation and global forwarding businesses that we have over there. Because of the scale and opportunity in Europe, it's a different investment cycle that we're very committed to building out our network and taking market share in both the surface transportation opportunities and global forwarding. We feel very good about our strategic objectives and our presence in the marketplace, our brand, our people. A lot of the things that we're growing on. It has been more of a challenge from an earnings growth standpoint in Europe just because of the scale and the overhead that's required, and the fact that there hasn't been a great economic environment for the last 3 to 4 years to kind of grow into. But we feel very good about the long-term prospects of our investments in Europe as well. I mentioned the globalization of our business and how we're focusing in outside of the United States, Canada, Mexico and Europe, probably our 3 of our top priorities of how we believe we can continue to strengthen that global transportation platform and offering that will be a big part of our future.","Tim Gagnon","Thanks, John. And this will be the last question. This is for Chad. Given the tight capacity, I would have thought truckload volumes might have been a little stronger. What might be constraining the additional volume growth, albeit GDP remains relatively sluggish?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Thanks, Tim. As we mentioned throughout the call today, we have been disciplined in our pricing practices for all freight and selective on transactional business that we commit to. We feel that we have grown many relationships, but called some freight from the portfolio through these disciplined pricing practices.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks Chad. And thank you, everybody, for participating in our Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. We know that we couldn't get to all of your questions today.

Robinson Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, October 23, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Angie Freeman.","Angela K. Freeman","Thank you. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, CEO; and Chad Lindbloom, CFO. John and Chad will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our third quarter performance. We will follow that with a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate the discussion. Slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Chad will be referring to the slides in their prepared comments.","Finally, I would like to remind you that comments made by John, Chad or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","And with that, I'll turn it over to John.","John P. Wiehoff","Thank you, Angie, and thanks to everybody who has taken the time to listen to our third quarter call. I'm going to start my prepared comments on Page 3 of the slide deck that Angie referenced. That slide highlights some of our overall key metrics for the quarter around our financial performance. For the third quarter, our total revenues grew 6.9%. Our net revenues grew 2.3%. Total revenues grew faster than our net revenues due to our volume growth and the impact of net revenue margin compression. Our income from operations grew 1.8%, and our earnings per share increased 2.9% to $0.72 per share.","Chad will make some prepared comments later on about our operating expenses but overall, the goal of our business model is that our net revenue and earnings growth should approximate each other, so we felt for the quarter that our model performed as expected. While those are some of the key financial metrics for the quarter, I'm going to go into some comments by each of the various services that we offer. But before we do that, I thought since many of those comments by service line are consistent with the last couple of quarters that I would start by highlighting some of what the overall trends and events in the environment that we feel are dominant throughout our explanations.","We've talked a lot this year and the last about the change in the marketplace, especially around shippers and in a slower growth environment that in the balance of their supply chains around growth and efficiency that we have felt a lot more focused on efficiency. When we're meeting with our customers, there generally is a very aggressive approach towards trying to reduce cost and improve efficiencies in their transportation spend and supply chain, much more so the last couple of years versus a higher focus on growth for new initiatives like there would have been in previous periods. In addition, we continue to feel significant cost pressures from the carriers in terms of the underlying commodities and wages that drive their cost pressure, which we feel is some of the overall things that are driving our margin compression. What we've talked about and will again this quarter is from a high-level how we're reacting to this environment and managing our business. We continue to look at all of the various services that we offer at Robinson, and I'll finish by making some comments about some of our previous press releases and the investments that we're making in realigning our portfolio of services.","We've talked a lot and are very focused internally on our productivity. While we've always been proud of our productivity metrics, the current environment is really pushing us to continue to seek new ways to be more efficient and to pass some of those efficiencies onto our customers and carriers. We continue to invest a lot in people and technology. We'll talk about our hires and how we're continuing to invest in our team and as well as our technology spend continues to advance.","We're focused on scale when we talk about the portfolio of services and the things that we're investing in. We do believe that it's becoming more and more important that we have the right size to be competitive in a lot of the services that we're offering. So overall, we're evolving our customer relationships to be more integrated with them, to respond to the environment and pressure that they're under and to offer more value-added services within transportation and logistics. While we haven't had the type of earnings growth this year that we're striving for, we do feel good about our investment and our competitive position for the future.","Moving in to the comments on our overall transportation services on Slide 4. Transportation net revenues were up 2.2% in the third quarter. Almost all of our transportation services had volume growth offset by net revenue margin compression. I'll comment specifically on the pricing for each of those services as we go through them. Our transportation net revenue margin declined in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011. While it was at the low end of our 10-year range for third quarters, it did show some improvement sequentially during the quarter.","Moving to Page 5 in our truck results. Reminder that truck net revenue includes both truckload and LTL and combined they grew 2.1% in the third quarter. We believe the volume gains for both truckload and less-than-truckload do reflect market share gains. Our truckload pricing for the quarter was flat year-over-year. And similar to my comments about overall transportation, the truckload net revenue margins compressed year-over-year. And similar to my comment, we did see some sequential easing in that compression throughout the quarter.","Moving to Slide 6 for intermodal. We did have mid-single-digit volume increase in our intermodal shipments throughout the third quarter. Net revenue margin declined due to the changing mix of our business and increased cost pressures from the capacity providers. Our intermodal business is evolving as we've discussed in past quarters around more commitments to some owned containers and some dedicated intermodal volumes that are helping us change the mix of the business to a more committed and longer-term relationships but coming with some margin compression as well.","Moving to Page 7 with our ocean and air or global forwarding results. Most of our experience here was fairly typical to what's happening in those industries. Our ocean volumes were down slightly. Our air net revenue decline of 9% was maybe a little bit unique compared to what's happening in the industry, while the volume overall from our perspective has declined significantly. The international and domestic air services, we did have some volume growth due to our small base and greater focus of certain lanes where we're trying to grow our air volumes. Because of the overall industry declines and the significant price declines in the market while we had that volume increase and some net revenue margin improvement, it still led to a net revenue decrease for the quarter of 9%.","I'll come back to this at the end of the prepared comments but obviously, one of the most significant announcements we had was the investment in the company, Phoenix International, to help grow and strengthen our global forwarding service in both the ocean and air categories.","Moving to Page 8, our other logistics services continues to be one of the bright spots in terms of higher net revenue growth for us this year. Net revenue growth was 16.6% in the quarter. As a reminder, again, the primary services included in this category include our transportation management services and our customs brokerage business. We do continue to see the long-term trend of growth with outsource and transportation management relationships and including more value added services as a result of the overall environment that I discussed in my opening comments.","Moving to Slide 9 around our Sourcing services. Sourcing net revenues grew 2% in the third quarter. Similar to our transportation services, we did have some volume growth, offset by net revenue margin compression. We do source a variety of fresh fruits and vegetable commodities, and those commodities fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Probably the most significant highlight from a commodity perspective was the continued strength of our melon activity, primarily from the Timco acquisition that had some positive growth in the quarter.","Last, on Page 10, our Payment Services. We're up 4.2% for the quarter. This reflects our subsidiary, T-Chek Systems, which we announced last week that we sold effective October 16. In that call, we talked about the components of the services and how the industry is consolidating and changing. So I'm not going to repeat a lot of that conversation. But in that previously recorded call, we did outlay the reasons why we felt scale and industry consolidation was changing things to make it so that we would be less competitive in the service offering and chose to divest.","So those are the prepared comments by service line. I'll turn it over to Chad for some comments on our summarized income statement, and then I will wrap it up with some overall thoughts about our alignment of strategy.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Thank you, John. Slide 11 is our summarized income statement. I'd like to highlight a few things for the quarter. We are pleased to -- we are pleased that we continue to operate very efficiently. In the third quarter, our operating income as a percentage of net revenue was slightly lower than the third quarter of 2011, but at 43.3% was still at the high end of our historic range.","In the third quarter of 2012, our headcount ended the quarter 8.5% higher than last year's third quarter, but our personnel expenses increased less than 1%. Increases in salaries and other expenses related to the increased headcount were largely offset by reductions in some of our incentive compensation and equity compensation programs that are based on growth and earnings.","Our stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was approximately $4.5 million compared to $9.5 million in the third quarter of 2011.","Growth and other operating expenses was driven by increases in many different areas, including travel, provision for doubtful accounts and approximately $1.5 million of acquisition and divestiture, legal fees and due diligence fees, both from a legal and accounting perspective.","Talking about travel. Our people have continued to focus on long-term growth. Our people are out working on sales and account development, which has led to this increased travel. Phoenix due diligence also increased our travel expenses during the quarter.","Moving on to Slide 12, we continue to have a strong balance sheet with cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter of approximately $273 million. Since the end of the quarter, we have also received $302.5 million for the sale of T-Chek and expect to use $571.5 million for the cash portion of the purchase price of Phoenix at the end of the year. We expect to enter into a $500 million revolving credit facility by the end of this month due in part to finance the acquisition of Phoenix.","Moving onto our capital expenditure activity. Our net CapEx, including investments in software, was approximately $13.9 million for the quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, we took delivery of 500 additional intermodal containers, bringing our fleet to a total of 1,000. The cost of these incremental 500 containers was approximately $6.6 million. $2.2 million of that was paid in Q3 of 2012 and as we mentioned, $2.8 million of that was included in our second quarter's capital expenditures.","During the third quarter of 2012, we repurchased 1,079,674 shares at an average price of $54.99. The share repurchase happened in the first half of the quarter. During the second half of the quarter, we ceased repurchasing shares because the company was in possession of material nonpublic information.","And now I'll turn it back to John for some closing prepared comments regarding our strategic alignment.","John P. Wiehoff","As I mentioned earlier, since we've had several press releases since our last earnings release, we thought maybe we would just share some prepared comments to tie together some of our activities and plans for the future. We announced an acquisition of Apreo in Poland towards the beginning of the quarter. We also announced the acquisition of Phoenix International, which I referenced earlier. When we look at our plans for the future and our portfolio of services, one of the conclusions that we reached is that both in the European continent and in our global forwarding services, we feel that there are opportunities to improve our growth prospects and our competitiveness by being larger and investing in some scale.","While we've been talking about expanding our global forwarding network and looking for strategic investments for quite some time, we've also talked about the fact that we were going to have a very high filter on the cultural fit and making certain that we've thought there was good synergies to the types of organizations that we would combine with. We did feel that Phoenix was a very unique opportunity for us and that it's a great cultural fit, and it will allow us to really change the scale that we operate within the global forwarding business.","So in reviewing our portfolio, because supply chains are more global and many of our services are connecting with our customers on a more global basis, and because scale matters in the effectiveness of those services, we felt it was an easy decision to move forward with making an investment like that. Similarly, as my comments earlier around T-Chek, when we look at the consolidation in the Payment Services industry and the card services that T-Chek operates in, there's a comparable movement towards consolidation and competitors focusing in on scale that we did not think had the good synergies to connect to the rest of our services, and that it made sense for us to divest rather than growing our scale in that service.","When we look at the other services in our portfolio, we feel like the remaining services that we offer today do all fit in our long-term strategy. We will also continue to look to invest in scale and growth opportunities in the other services that we offer. We'll be very focused on the integration with Phoenix International for the next 1 or 2 years, so it's unlikely that we would make material investments along that service line. But there are other services that we offer we believe that we could continue to look for opportunities to grow those more aggressively.","I'll close on the bottom half of Page 13. I know that the realignment of our business and the financing for Phoenix acquisition has raised questions about our capital structure and our expectations going forward. First and foremost, we need to close the Phoenix transaction and close our financing facility that we expect to over the next couple of weeks. But what we did want to share is that while we're going to continue to look at that capital structure and make decisions around our dividends and share repurchase activity going forward, we do not expect to modify our dividend policy at this time. We will be having discussions with our board around the level of share repurchase activity. But we do expect to continue to repurchase shares. And as we get a clearer focus on what debt levels will be at and what philosophy we think makes sense going forward, we will share that with you in future periods, but we do expect to continue share repurchases to some degree as well.","Those are our prepared comments. Thank you for listening. And at this point, we'll open it up for any other questions that you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","John, just wanted to talk a little bit -- I mean, obviously, there's a lot going on with your business, and I definitely applaud you for looking at the other areas of growth and see how things are changing. As supply chains kind of evolve and become more flexible, do you feel that you're now in a great position to kind of take advantage of that? Or are there still more pieces of the puzzle that you think that you need to add over time or other places that you'd like to be?","John P. Wiehoff","We are proud of what we think we can do from an integrated services standpoint to help a shipper with broader supply chain needs, everything from network analysis and modeling to all the various types of transportation or logistic needs that they might have. When you get into the specifics of our customer relationships and all the various needs that they have, it would be unrealistic to say that we have everything or that we feel that we can do anything that any of our customers would need. There's a lot of incremental information and analytical components of the supply chain that we really want to continue to strengthen. There's a number of inventory management and consolidation-type things that we know we can get a lot better at. Even within the transportation offerings, there are certain lanes or niches around hazardous materials or other things that we're working to invest more aggressively on. So we feel good about our footprint and the broader capabilities that we have. But we know there's also a lot of opportunity to continue to strengthen and expand the service menu.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And just how fast do you think that, that changes and continues to evolve? Obviously, you've seen a lot of change over the last couple of years as you alluded to. Does that change even more rapidly in terms of the adoption of kind of more complete solutions, or do you think that is just an evolutionary kind of track?","John P. Wiehoff","It's actually been going on for quite some time if you look at really over the last 10 years around some of our transportation management services and our global forwarding investments. I would say the macroeconomic environment and the change in our -- what we see as our customers focus on efficiency and cost savings over the last couple of years has fairly accelerated it. Whether it will stay that way probably has to do with the combination of how our customers and how the industries continue to change, and if they stay focused on efficiency and less focused on growth, or if we get back to an economic growth scenario, as well as how we interpret the investment opportunities in the marketplace and whether or not from a price and cultural fit standpoint we find the right sort of thing to invest more aggressively in.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Chad, you had mentioned the $1.5 million in legal and accounting fees and due diligence and then the additional expense associated with increased travel. The bad debt expense, did you quantify that? I guess I'm interested if we could just get -- if we could quantify this quarter in the other expense line item, how much is truly onetime versus recurring?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Sure. Let me talk about the provision for doubtful accounts. You can actually see that amount on the cash flow statement. Maybe -- I guess for the quarter you'd have to back into it because we only give a year-to-date cash flow statement. But the provision for doubtful accounts this year's third quarter was $4.5 million versus last year's third quarter was $2.9 million. As far as the onetime nature of the expenses, now there's $1.5 million approximately of specific dealer-related legal and outside accounting services related to primarily the acquisition, but there was also some legal fees associated with the divestiture of T-Chek in there as well. Those are definitely more of a onetime nature. We're not done with deal-related expenses on the acquisition because the deal hasn't closed yet. And there is an investment banking fee that is contingent upon closing that is close to $8 million. And then to get up to the estimated total amount of $8 million, there's also some additional tax and legal due diligence ongoing between the signing and closing.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Good. And then I guess, John, when we think about -- we think about productivity. If you look at gross profit per employee, it appears that we're at an inflection point, at least as it relates to the year-over-year decline. Can we separate and how much is environmental versus how much is associated with the new hiring and the drag that, that's created on a gross profit per employee basis? I'm just trying to get a sense for how much of it is associated to the pressures that we're facing on a gross profit per unit basis as opposed to what might be related to the on-boarding of -- and the growth of the employee base.","Chad M. Lindbloom","This is Chad, and it's really difficult to isolate the 2 impacts because definitely, we know when we have tighter margin percentages it takes more work or more transactions to generate the same amount of net revenue. That compounded with the fact that we're up 8% or 9% in headcount, and in addition to that have replaced turnover. We're in the 20-plus percent range, 20% to 25% range of new -- people new within the last year. So definitely those people also generate less net revenue per person, but it's really difficult to precisely quantify the impact of the 2.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","John, can I ask you for a little bit more clarification on your comments about the repurchases? I understand that's a board decision. But is it management's view that a good use of capital now is to actually buy the shares when they're at a valuation that we've not seen for a very long time, if at all, since IPO. So I would think the more aggressive capital structure would make sense, but I'm curious as to what management would suggest the Board do.","John P. Wiehoff","Part of the reason for the way I phrased my comments was that for quite some time now, what we've said around our share repurchase philosophy is that we would use what we determine to be excess cash amounts to repurchase shares, and that it was more of a capital distribution philosophy than a valuation play. But we also always said that if we ever felt like the valuation parameters got to the low end or below our range for executing that philosophy, that we would reconsider. So given the fact that through these acquisitions, we will have some level of debt going into 2013 and because we do believe that the valuation is at a level that's lower than any time in the last 10 years from a multiple standpoint when we were looking at our purchase price activity, we do feel like a different philosophy probably makes sense. We need to spend some time with our Board to be precise around exactly what our new targets will be or exactly what parameters will execute those share repurchases under. But yes, we do feel like a different capital structure will be in place and is appropriate, given a low interest rate environment, the low valuation of the stock and some of the growth opportunities that we think we have.","Chad M. Lindbloom","For much of the period since we went public, it was only slightly accretive, if accretive at all, to repurchase shares based on the combination of where interest rates were, as well as where our PE was. Both of those have changed in the directions that obviously make share repurchases more accretive.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, no, exactly. Lastly, just -- can you talk at all about the October trends? I arrived late to the call, so if you said that, I apologize. But I don't think I caught that.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Okay. We did not comment on the October trends. Part of the impact of the transactions that are happening, it makes those numbers less comparable or less indicative of what the whole quarter would be, even though the first 3 weeks of the quarter never does tell the whole story. But just so you realize that until we have a systems integration on the Phoenix acquisition starting with this quarter, we're not going to have daily net revenue information available like we do today. So for sure, beginning next quarter, we could not provide you what the first month or the first 3 weeks or 4 weeks of a month were. So we're going to have to discontinue the process going forward. We will give you -- through October 22, truckload volume per day was up 6.5%. In that if you exclude the T-Chek revenues from both quarters that our net revenue growth was up approximately 5% in that same period in October. Again, this is probably -- likely the last time that we'll be able to give you a number like that for the foreseeable future because of the systems integration or the lack of availability of comparable numbers on a daily basis. And then even once we do have a system integration, it will take another year to have comparable numbers.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But even -- but Phoenix, they don't do truckload, do they?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Do not do truckload. We would have -- or they do not do a significant amount of truckload.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. So you would still have truckload, you just wouldn't have the total for the corporation.","John P. Wiehoff","Yes, we will not be able to give net revenue numbers the same way that we have been giving them in the past.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Chad, just to clarify, that you would still be able to get the truckload volumes on a per day basis, right? I mean, leaving off the total company net revenues, right?","Chad M. Lindbloom","The slightly less precision for the acquisition in Poland until it gets on our system, as well as any truckload activity that is -- and again, it's very small, that is booked by Phoenix. But we won't have the same level of precision for the next year or so on those numbers.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up. John, you said on your opening slide, you aim to grow truck gross and net at the same pace, but you did 2% versus 7%. A little bit smaller gap than last quarter's 0% and 9%. Obviously, that's the sequential boost of the net margins but away from the first quarter where both were up 7%. So what does it take to get back to the equilibrium and how do you get there?","John P. Wiehoff","Well, just to clarify what I intended to say, at least in my opening comments, is that our business model goal is that our net revenues of growth of 2.3% and our earnings growth -- earnings per share growth of 2.9% would reflect the variable nature of our cost structure. Over time, the gross revenue and net revenue would hopefully grow similarly as well too when we go through a period of time of margin compression like we have for the last several years, net revenue is obviously going to grow slower. So what we need in order to get back to a more comparable net revenue and gross revenue or total revenue growth is a period of time where we have flat or expanding margins. So as we've been saying for the last couple of years, we really need to find bottom on the gross margin comparisons or the net revenue comparison, and then continue to grow our volumes and both total revenues and net revenues should grow at a more comparable rate going forward.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So when you talked about pricing being flat and truck cost being up, are you indicating then you're still seeing that compression going on, or given the net was up sequentially that you feel that you've turned the corner on expanding those margin?","John P. Wiehoff","So with flat pricing to shippers and a small increase in the cost of carriers for the quarter, we did for the quarter continue to see that compression. As I said in my comments, it did begin to ease during the quarter and ended the quarter at fairly comparable margin percentages for the previous year. So we don't know what the fourth quarter will look like because there was some improvement versus a year ago. So depending upon the supply and demand relationship in this fourth quarter, we could be hitting bottom or turning that quarter. But it's been difficult enough the last couple of years that I really can't make that prediction. But hopefully...","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate it. What's that?","John P. Wiehoff","I said but hopefully it is.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.","Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","It's Ed in for Scott. Just to further up on Ken's question, is there a way, Chad, to look at how the quarter progressed kind of on a year-over-year margin on the transportation yields? You said by the end of the quarter they were basically flat. How do they start and then how do they progress through the first couple of weeks of October, if you don't mind?","Chad M. Lindbloom","The -- when you look at the 2 quarter -- the 2012 quarter compared to the 2011 quarter, total transportation net revenue margin was increasing in 2012 and it was decreasing in 2011. So there was a relatively large spread at the beginning of the quarter. But by the end of the quarter for the month of September, the numbers were very comparable to each other. So far in October, most of our revenue margins on transportation are relatively flat with last year's October, maybe slightly lower if I remember correctly. That's a very tough number to get in for the quarter because there's intercompany sales that need to be eliminated or intra-month because there is a little less precision on the margin percentage, but we believe that they're very close to each other for the month of October.","Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Can you give the net revenue year-over-year growth numbers for transportation? I think that it was 1% in July. Last time you had commented through 3 weeks and you said 5% so far in October. Can you give what July was for the full month and then August, September?","Chad M. Lindbloom","No. No, we're not going to disclose that.","Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. In terms of the -- you talked about the $1.5 million of legal expenses for the divestiture and acquisition, and there's going to be some more. Is there any way to break out what some of those costs will look like in the fourth quarter?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Yes, John mentioned I think in his prepared remarks on the last slide or at least the number was highlighted that we expect on Phoenix to have approximately $8 million more of transaction-related expenses. The biggest portion of that is the investment banking fees.","Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","And that will include the legal in the quarter as well?","Chad M. Lindbloom","The legal and the tax due diligence will be -- or it might drive it slightly over $8 million. The investment banking fee is a little bit under $8 million, so I think $8 million overall is a relatively good estimate.","Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And last one is part of that. It seems like there wasn't -- despite strong cash generation in the quarter and $240 million of cash going into the quarter, you didn't generate any interest income in the quarter. Was there something--did you put some cash for Phoenix's side somewhere or do something that curtailed the income in the quarter? Is there something else?","Chad M. Lindbloom","No. I mean, yields are just extremely low. Not all the cash on the balance sheet is invested. A lot of it is spread around the world in operating accounts.","Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Because last quarter it was $700,000. And this quarter, there was less than $100,000.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Last quarter, we had an unusual item of -- we talked about it of a passive investment that we had made many years ago that we got a distribution from.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets.","John L. Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess today on one of the truckload carriers calls, they indicated that basically, pricing was not as firm as the quarter progressed and that their customers were less concerned about capacity availability in the marketplace. I'm just kind of curious, while your margin compression obviously was there on a year-over-year basis, it was not -- you had sequential pickup. I heard what you said about it but improving through the quarter, but can you give us a feel for where you felt capacity was at the end of the quarter? And do you think -- can you just give us a little bit more color as to do volumes tighten up enough or firm up enough in the fourth quarter that you think that tightens back up, or do you think that we're in a looser capacity situation given the macro environment kind of overweighing whatever we see on the peak basis?","John P. Wiehoff","I think the comments that you just shared are consistent with what we saw or we feel -- market tightness is always relative. But from our perspective, the market did loosen as the quarter went on, which is what allowed that easing of some of the margin compression. And what most of us have been talking about this year is there really hasn't been any measurable peak season or tightening in the fall like there had been in some previous years. So it feels overall to us like fairly soft or consistent demand environment and not a lot of tightness or a fairly loose market finishing the quarter and going into the fourth quarter.","John L. Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then...","John P. Wiehoff","Some of that has to be taken in context though too that there's been periods of time where the market was much more volatile and the relative ranges of a tight market or a loose market were much greater than what we're seeing today. So when we look at our route guide depth and some of the other metrics that we would look at to try to assess the market tightness, while it loosened a little bit near the end of the quarter, it was nothing like  the first half of 2009 or other periods of time where that supply and demand fluctuation would be much more greater than what we've seen for the last couple of years.","John L. Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. That makes sense. All right. And just a question on -- obviously, you made the comment about how many times we've heard from you guys since your last earnings call. I mean, this is obviously, you've had a lot going on with acquisitions and divestitures. I'm just curious. Are you concerned at all about taking your eye off the ball at all on the core business? And I know you've got this big, decentralized -- and you put network and you put a lot of responsibility into your branch managers' hands, does that protect you from maybe the risk of taking your eye off the ball on the core business as you kind of go through what's going to be a big acquisition and a large divestiture?","John P. Wiehoff","I think when you kind of break it down, first off, when we had a lot of activity, I do feel like in many ways, it's coincidental around some things that we've been working on for a long time that finally just came to fruition in the last quarter. So I don't feel like this is a new environment for us where we're going to be so much more aggressive that we change the culture or start driving our growth in a different way. But first off and although the divestiture of T-Chek was a lot of effort, hopefully, that will give us some more narrow focus going forward. Expanding our global forwarding network has been something that we put a lot of energy into over the last 10-plus years. One of the things that we got with the Phoenix acquisition is a new leadership team that is going to help us really in a different way than what we've had before. We needed leadership and we needed expertise in that service line, and we're pretty excited about the team that we got and the success that they were having. So a lot of the integration effort will be led and absorbed by new people to Robinson who came with that acquisition. We certainly had some talent that will be an important part of that team as well too. But when we think about 2013 and looking forward, integrating Phoenix with our global forwarding business is clearly at the top of the list of things that we will stay focused on. It is a dedicated team that's separate from the North American transportation business and should be able to operate largely on their own. The other acquisition in Europe, we have a separate leadership team over there as well too. So we don't feel too stretched or spread out at this point going into 2013. But it is a fair point that whenever you have this kind of activity or change going on, that we need to make certain that we don't dilute our focus or our cultural consistency across all of our services, and we're very locked in on making sure that doesn't happen.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with from JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, let's see. We wanted to see if you could -- I guess give a sense here on the headcount and volume relationship that you expect, and how you expect those things to look the next couple of quarters? Are you planning to slow down the headcount additions, or you think you're going to keep it the same? And how do you think about volume growth and what seems to be a fairly weak economy in general?","John P. Wiehoff","Yes, so first off, just with the acquisition transactions that we expect, there will be a pretty significant change in headcount going into the fourth quarter. So for modeling, don't forget that Phoenix has about 2,000 employees. But if you cleanse the transactions in the normal productivity level over the last several years as we started to reach the high end of our productivity levels and probably around a year or so ago, started to staff up more aggressively, I think for the last year or so, so we've averaged about 8% or 9% headcount increase in our reportings. While you have to break it down to really understand it precisely, probably the most visible metric that those headcounts should correlate to over the long time -- over the long term would be truckload volume growth because that's our biggest portion of our business. So while we had 8% volume growth in the quarter and 8% or 9% headcount growth, if volume growth continues to slow, we're pretty quick at adjusting that spigot and slowing down the hiring. So from a North American truckload standpoint, we feel like hopefully those 2 would stay pretty well and in sync going forward. And that we're going to continue to look at trying to aggressively take market share because we think that's the best answer in the long term. Each office will make that decision on their own around what their sales pipeline looks like and where they think they can gain share with reasonable margins.","But over time, that's how we would think about headcount growth.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And what do you think about, I guess the impact of weak freight versus competition? I know it's hard -- it's a big market, it's kind of hard to tell what hurts you or helps you. But do you think the bigger issue here in terms of your slower pace of net revenue growth and earnings growth and so forth, is it just a really a demand issue? When you seeing a stronger economy, that's really the biggest thing and stronger freight market, or do you think that it's really -- there is some impact from some of the private brokers that are pretty focused on growing at a fast pace, and maybe just willing to take lower gross margin than what you guys have had historically?","John P. Wiehoff","That's a good question. And as we've been asked this and have thought about it and analyzed it for the last couple of years, there's definitely a lot of factors at play. I believe that perhaps the largest factor is that when you think about a third-party model and a business like ours taking market share, that the easiest way for us to grow and take market share is when a customer is growing and has new and different needs that they need help with that weren't planned for at the beginning of the year. And when I look back at our history and kind of compare it to the last couple of years, when you get into a more slower growth, more static environment with a lot of consistency in the freight, and shippers start bidding higher percentages for their freight more aggressively and are looking more aggressively for cost savings, it's frankly just a lot more difficult for a business like us to take market share than it is in a high-growth environment where there's just a lot of new and fresh opportunities to go after. So when the growth plateaus a little bit, if we're trying to aggressively take share and certainly, there probably are some competitors as well too, you start looking towards each other's current base of freight to try to get that market share and things tighten up and just get a lot more competitive. So I feel like in any industry, it's probably easier to grow your business when there's overall growth. But because third-party logistics has a lot to do with transforming the landscape and the industry around flexibility and different types of service levels, I think it's probably -- maybe even a disproportionate impact of the growth opportunity for somebody like us. So we're going to continue to sell and evolve our services to adapt to this environment. But yes, some economic growth and overall improvement in the freight demand would certainly make a big difference.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe just a question on the -- going back to the net revenue or productivity on a per employee basis. When you think about the mix that's occurring in the business with the acquisitions with the new stuff coming in, Phoenix, and losing T-Chek, does the still kind of the old kind of rules of thumb apply to the productivity on a per employee basis kind of when you think about seasoning the workforce? Obviously, you mentioned that you still have a bunch there of folks that are going to be kind of relatively new to the business. But as those people mature, is there any reason to think that there should be any material change in the ability of how productive they can be going forward?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Yes, T-Chek net revenue per person is not going to have a major impact. There was only 200 people or 190 people out of the total 8,000-plus before the Phoenix acquisition. When you look at Phoenix, they have 2,000 people. And if you do the calculation based on the net revenues that we disclosed earlier for those 2,000 people, you'll see that their average net revenue per person is lower than ours. So we've always talked about how our freight forwarding business had a lower net revenue per person. So as we continue to grow that international Freight Forwarding business, I think you will see some deterioration in our consolidated net revenue per person. That business is much more administrative-intensive even with the investments in technology that we've made. There's a lot more clerical, administrative-type work involved in freight forwarding than there is in truck brokerage because of the complex documentation requirements. So there will be a shift that's very difficult at this time to quantify it, but as we continue to go forward, we'll try to add some clarity to that.","John P. Wiehoff","About half of those 2,000 employees are in Asia. So the average cost per employee will adjust as well when those metrics come into our productivity cards.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe switching gears back to the kind of capital structure discussion earlier in the call. When you think about some of the changes that are going on and where you think about yourself from a multiple perspective and allocating capital to share repurchases and otherwise, how do you think -- how does discussions about your long-term kind of growth rate targets play into that? I mean, any thoughts about how that might evolve as the business continues to evolve through acquisitions and just kind of maturity of the business going forward?","John P. Wiehoff","Yes, every time we talked about capital structure in the past, what we've said and what we continue to believe, with Phoenix being an example, is that if there is opportunities to grow our business, the highest return is organic growth. The next highest return is probably the right acquisition from an inorganic growth standpoint. And then we also feel like at the right time, we can create value by repurchasing our own shares. So what we're going to continue to look at is where are there opportunities for acquisition? Where are there opportunities to use our capital to grow service lines and create value. We always give the right freedom to grow organically and use working capital to grow any existing offices or open offices and fund that organic growth. But historically, we've had plenty of capital left for acquisitions and then some remaining capital that we've used for share repurchases. Because we think the value proposition is better around the current pricing, what that's going to do is really cause us to look probably more specifically at what we think our acquisition activity and demands for capital might be and what levels of debt, if any of that we're comfortable with, continuing to carry just simply because of the value opportunity and share repurchases. So it gets to be a loop of all that. How much do we think we need for our organic growth? What type of acquisition opportunities do we expect? And then what level of capital structure are we comfortable with to execute share repurchases.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tom Albrecht with BB&T Capital Markets.","Thomas S. Albrecht - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","It does feel in some ways like things are beginning to bottom a little bit, but I wanted to just get a little more clarity on the volumes. I was reviewing my notes from the late July conference call. At that point, TL volumes were up about 11%. And we know that for the quarter, they grew about 8%. We obviously know net revenues trended better, but it feels like volumes did get softer. How soft were they during the month of September?","Chad M. Lindbloom","As far as the first, just to cover the 11% versus 8%, this year's third quarter did have one less business day than last year's third quarter. Now we don't know that, that necessarily means there's one less business day's worth of freight that moved in the market. But if you make that assumption that it is true, that is about a 1.7% impact. So the number that we gave you in late July was on a per business day basis, and we had one less business day than we did last year's third quarter.","Thomas S. Albrecht - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. So the 8% then, that's the total volumes and the 11% was a per day reference?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Correct.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Bascome Majors in for Matt Troy here. The cost creep at LTL carriers has certainly been attained for a long time, but it seems to have gotten much tougher as far as the margin compression as pricing has fallen over the last few months. I'm curious as to what you're seeing from your small and mid-sized carrier base as to any response from that yet with respect to how they deal with you as an intermediary.","John P. Wiehoff","Well, it's -- I don't think there's anything that we can say universally what -- when we talk about the metrics around the market and our earlier comments about the market softening, one of the things that we will see in our business is those larger carriers typically get much more aggressive about looking for backhaul capacity and expanding their available capacity in a broader way in the market. And when they do that, it tends to conflict more with kind of the medium and small carriers that don't have such fixed networks out there around how they run their equipment. So what typically happens when the market begins to soften like this as you will see a little bit more tension around competitive pricing between the big carriers and the small carriers. And we did see some of that activity towards the end of the quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Chad, quick one on the tax rate. You're at 37.7% year-to-date. Are you trued up year-to-date and we should expect the fourth quarter pre-Phoenix to be at that rate? And then when you bring in Phoenix, they do have operations around the world. How is that going to change the tax rate we should be modeling going forward?","Chad M. Lindbloom","We expect the tax -- the core tax rate of C.H. Robinson excluding Phoenix to remain relatively consistent. We've talked about a 37.5% to 38.5% effective tax rates. When we look at Phoenix's operations, we would expect that tax rate, the core operational tax rate to stay consistent with what the -- what C.H. Robinson's tax rate is. We do prebook our tax expense assuming that eventually accumulated cash across the globe will be repatriated. So the fact that they are earning some of their earnings in lower tax jurisdiction, given that we have a cash generative business, when you look at the eventual use of those cashes, and you run out of eventual reinvestments without repatriation, U.S. GAAP says you should accrue the tax expense as if you were going to repatriate it in the future, which is the practice that C.H. Robinson has always followed and expects to follow.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. They will be maintained, in other words?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Well, there will be an impact to the overall tax rate based on -- and it's a number that we don't know precisely how much acquisition amortization we will have related to identifiable intangible assets as we have begun but do not have our purchase price allocation done. But any amortization expense, which could be -- it's very difficult to know the precise number but it could be relatively significant. I won't be surprised if there was a number in the $20 million per year range. That amortization will not be tax-deductible. So that could have an impact of 0.5% or 0.75% to C.H. Robinson's overall effective tax rate. So while the operational tax rate is staying the same, we could see a creep up in our overall effective rate because of that nondeductible amortization in the initial years of the acquisition.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in terms of looking at the expenses below the net revenue line, our -- at this point in time, can you -- are you comfortable telling us outside of the amortization how some of those are going to change if Phoenix is integrated?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Yes. I think if you -- once we have closed the transaction, post that, we will file some financial and quarterly financial information for historic Phoenix activity that you could use as a base. But initially, we would expect the results of Phoenix that were disclosed in the Phoenix announcement, so basically we added to C.H. Robinson initially. I think we're going to experience some revenue synergies and things going forward. And there may be some operating cost synergies going forward, but in the initial period, much of that potential will be absorbed by some -- short-term incremental integration cost.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So just one question on the gross margins. I know you've spent some time on that. But how much of the compression that you felt is just the market and the balance in the market that you've talked about on previous calls, versus your own efforts to go out and gain share like you've talked about, and maybe the types of contracts that you've had to enter into to be able to gain share. Has that also contributed to some of the compression that you felt?","John P. Wiehoff","It's difficult to know precisely where that line would split. But one of the things that I guess we feel good about is that when we look at our entire book of business, the incremental freight that we've been able to get over the last year or 2, we do have fairly consistent margins across our customers and our verticals and our regions. So it's not like we have a static book of freight from the year before and then an incremental amount of freight that we don't make much money on or is at much lower margins. That margin compression comes pretty much across-the-board in all of our different services and all of our different truckload regions. So what that means to us is we feel like the real trade-off of going after that incremental market share is the personnel cost or the people that we have to add in order to do that. We don't really think it affects pricing per se in terms of how we have to price to go get that incremental market share because the market is so fragmented, we really can't control it. So when we think about going after that incremental market share and what impact there might be to our business by being more aggressive, we spoke just primarily on headcount and operating expenses as the trade-off to make sure that we're making good choices in doing that.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Interesting. So the object of trying to go out and get share maybe hasn't been as big an issue on your gross margin, but it has contributed to the fact that your headcount keeps growing a lot faster than your revenue has?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Correct. That's the way we think of it.","Angela K. Freeman","Unfortunately, we're out of time. So that will have to be our last question. We apologize we couldn't get to everybody today.

And I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, the Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Gagnon","Thank you. Joining me on our call today will be John Wiehoff, our Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Hagen [ph], Corporate Controller. Chad Lindbloom, our Chief Financial Officer, is not on the call today as he is recovering from shoulder surgery after a biking accident. Chad will be fine and should be back to work soon. Scott, John and I will be filling in for Chad to cover today's content and questions. John and I will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our first quarter and we'll follow that up with a question-and-answer session. Scott Hagen will join John and me to participate in the Q&A session.","We have a few more prepared comments today and we'd like to get as many of your questions covered as possible. [Operator Instructions]","Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate our discussion. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at chrobinson.com.","John and I will be referring to these slides in our prepared comments. I'd like to remind you that comments made by John, Scott, myself or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","Before I turn it over to John, I'd like to highlight a couple of changes in the earnings release and the slide deck. First, we have separated our truckload and less-than-truckload services to provide more detail to the area we formerly called truck. We've received a lot questions about the independent performance of each of these services, and this change will provide more detail than the combined view. We've also added a line for customs, which was formerly bundled in the other logistic services line. Also, with the impact of our purchase of Phoenix International and the divestiture of T-Chek similar to our year-end 2012 earnings release, we have provided pro forma financial measures for net revenue and income from operations to provide meaningful insight and an alternative perspective of our results of operations. We believe that these pro forma financial measures reflect an additional way of analyzing aspects of our ongoing operations that when viewed with our actual results provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business. A reconciliation of the actual results to pro forma numbers is provided in an appendix at the end of the slide deck.","With that, I'll turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments on Slide 2 with a review of our Q1 2013 results.","John P. Wiehoff","Thank you, Tim, and thanks to everybody who has taken the time to listen to our first quarter earnings call.","As Tim said, my comments are starting on Page 2 with our actual results.","Our total revenues for the first quarter of 2013 were up 17.3% to just under $3 billion. Our total net revenues grew 9.9% to $455 million. Our income from operations was down 0.5% to $168.7 million. And our EPS was at $0.64, down $0.01 from 1 year ago of $0.65.","Turning to Page 3. Tim commented on the notion that we're presenting the pro forma information, so I want to start by walking you through Page 3 and helping you understand how we think the most appropriate way to look at the numbers.","For starters, one of the things that's important, we touched on this on the fourth quarter call, that on November 1, when we acquired Phoenix International, from day 1 and over the last 6 months, we have been managing our historical global forwarding business and the Phoenix International business as one combined global forwarding business. I'll touch on the more specifics around where we're at in the integration and how we're managing it together. But because of that, already, our operations and results are combined into one business. So we really can't provide very clear commentary on what things would be like this year with or without our acquisitions. So the best way to pro forma the information is to adjust the prior year 2012 activity, which we're doing on Slide 3 here.","So as you see, we're taking, in the center of the slide, the 2012 actual results for Robinson, subtracting the T-Check business that was sold towards the end of last year and then adding in the historic operations of Phoenix from the pro forma information that was previously filed. So what that's doing is calculating the 2012 pro forma information as though Phoenix had been included in the prior year. So the slide on the far right side of the column then is comparing our pro forma information to -- from 2012 to the 2013 actual information.","So the way we're looking at our business going forward in this pro forma format, that adjusted for all of the activity, we would report net revenue increase of 3.8%, operating expense increase of 6% and income from operations that are roughly flat.","One of the things that Tim will be making a few prepared comments on, we always talk and focus you towards the operating income as a percent of net revenue. If you see down on the bottom, on the pro forma number, that 38.3% pro forma for 2012 comparing to the 37% for 2013. So we'll come back to that later in the presentation, but these are the numbers adjusted as we understand them to be best presented and we'll comment from there.","So moving to Slide 4.","For total transportation, and this would include the results of all of our business including Phoenix, we see for the first quarter is transportation margin of 16.2%. We've had this ongoing conversation for the last several years around trying to understand our margins and the activity in the marketplace. We added this schedule a while back, and I still think it's a relevant way to start. There's a lot of things folding into our total transportation, and I think the more insightful comments follow by each of the individual service lines. And as Tim indicated, we've rearranged those and broken out LTL separately to try to give some greater clarity around what's happening in each of the individual services. But I do think it's worthwhile to look at transportation as a whole just in terms of our margin percentage for each quarter. It gives you some perspective on the history, as well as what the enterprise margins are looking towards.","There's a lot of opinions on how to best analyze the margins around the percentages. Oftentimes, the margin per unit or per shipment is more helpful. But one of the things that when we analyze our business a number of different ways, we do feel that there is a common theme across the transportation margin, that across all of our services, there really does continue to be this theme of handling more volume for less net revenue. So our comments around margin compression and kind of the tightness in the marketplace is revealed at the enterprise level here with the margin comparisons.","Moving on then to truckload on Page 5.","What you see for the first quarter of 2013 is a net revenue increase of 1.9%. Volume increasing 9% overall, with 5% in North America. Similar to some previous quarters that slower net revenue growth is being driven by a cost increase of 2.5%, with customer price increases of 1.5%. So we're unable to pass through the entire increase of the cost to hire during the quarter.","And we shared at year-end that January began slow from a truckload volume standpoint. We did see some improvement to that 5% as the quarter wore on. From a net revenue margin standpoint, it also began very slow. We talked about plant shutdowns and a very slow, stagnant environment at the beginning of the year. So while we did see some improvement throughout the quarter by the end of March, by the back half of March, our year-over-year net revenue margin comparisons were consistent with the previous year.","Now there's a comment on the slide here about the market conditions, and I know that in every quarter for the past several years, we've gotten a lot of questions around the market conditions and the competitive landscape. So I have a few prepared thoughts to try to frame up some of these comments or things we've said before, but maybe to try to put it into context a little bit as to how we're thinking about the North American truckload market.","If you start with the fact that it is a very large and fragmented market, while we believe we're the largest provider, we still do believe that we're somewhere around 2% or 3% of that share. With more than 10,000 third-party competitors and tens of thousands of asset-based providers that participate in the truckload piece of it, it's really hard for us to get real precise measurements on the industry as a whole or kind of how the market is changing. But what we do know for sure, in the last 3 years, some of the metrics that we have is that we do believe the market is growing slower than the past several years, all the different freight indexes and what we see and hear from our customers, that the market is growing slower. We've used this term that the market is balanced. We have a couple of metrics that we track and are otherwise in the industry around route guide compliance and looking at the level of exceptions and freight tendering in the marketplace. There's also transactional load boards that we have and that others make available in the marketplace where we can see, in our exposure to the market, a meaningful decrease in transactional activity and expedited or short-term type needs. So this balanced market with route guide compliance being high, transactional activity being less, less capacity, very few new trucks being added to the market relative to the overall replacement needs and the size of the market, and numerous data points about shipper\/receiver attitudes focused on predictability of their supply chain, lowering inventory, focusing in on efficiency. So when we start to look at the marketplace and the competitive environment, we start with the fact that it does feel like a different market in the last 3 years or subsequent to the recession than prior to that. And those data points would continue to support that in the first quarter and what we're seeing in the second quarter so far.","From a competitive standpoint, equally, what makes it difficult is that while there is more than 10,000 registered brokers and third-party providers, more than -- high 90% of those are private companies that we really don't have a lot of great visibility to. For those that are larger or more visible public companies, there clearly has been a shift of many of them more aggressively declaring goals of taking market share aggressively, a few roll-ups with aggressive acquisitions and focus on technology. So while it's really difficult to separate the overall changes in the market and what impact the additional competition or the competitive market is having, we still look at it and say, based on the current market condition then the competitive landscape, it has been more difficult for us to grow both the volume and margin for the truckload services that we provide.","I think one other additional level of insight that's interesting that when we think about the competitive landscape and the market conditions, that we also analyze kind of by customer, by industry, by vertical. And there are certain things, the advantage of us being larger and being able to leverage our scale in some instances, but it also gives us exposure to a lot of different pieces where we do have a business in the flatbed sector, which is much softer than some of the others. Our business in Europe is soft from a volume and margin standpoint, given the overall economic conditions there. When we look at some of the industry verticals, we've shared many times in the past around our pie chart of activity is heavily focused on beverage and paper and some of the verticals that have been softer. So when we're comparing to these thousands of small competitors, what's difficult sometimes is there are so many different ways to sell, and a lot of them are aligned with assets and more dedicated freights. Some of them are very specific to temperature controlled. And we have a number of our offices, more than 20 that, have double-digit increases and are doing very well. So there's a lot of different niches, a lot of different ways to sell, a very fragmented marketplace. And I guess the point of all of that is, it's difficult for us to really get our arms around exactly what's cyclical, what's secular, how this is all changing. But we do feel good about our competitive positioning and the fact that we have a unique offering in the marketplace and that we can do a lot of things that others can't. And that while we are very sensitive to more and increased competition, a lot of this is adapting to the market conditions and customer expectations that keep changing.","So moving on to Slide 6 and the LTL results that are separated for the first time.","A part of what you see is a more consistent net revenue growth and estimated volume activity in LTL. So 12.9% net revenue growth for the quarter to $58.4 million, and approximately a 12% volume increase in LTL shipments over the previous year.","Our LTL business has been performing more consistently over the last several years. While we do show a net revenue margin compression for our LTL results, these margins, like every other service, tend to fluctuate. And this margin compression was probably more in the norm of just typical fluctuations from past periods.","Moving on to Slide 7 in our intermodal results.","While LTL has been more stable, intermodal is probably one of our more challenging service lines from a profitability standpoint. You see a net revenue decline of 6.3% for the quarter. On a slight decrease in volume, close to flat, but also net revenue or net margin compression as well.","When we think about our intermodal services, we feel very good about our market knowledge and our capability of executing around drayage and keeping our customers happy and moving the intermodal freight. Our big challenge has really been on that cost of hire in our margin compression. We've been able to keep servicing our customers and participating in the intermodal space, but our margin compression has probably been the most severe of any of the services that we offer, and it's generally associated with -- we're pretty comfortable that we have market-based pricing to shippers. It really is the disadvantage of scale and the contractual and capacity relationships that cause us a disadvantage.","We've also talked about, through those contracts and the various pricing mechanisms, the transition in the marketplace that we've had over the last several years to larger, more dedicated accounts with longer-term pricing. We actually feel reasonably good about, again, our pricing and capabilities and our pipeline around new activities, but we recognize that we have some improvement to do on the commitment and capacity side to make sure that our margins and profitability stay competitive as well.","So moving on to Phoenix integration on Slide 8.","I've got a few comments prepared here on the quarter, let's talk about Phoenix integration. I know that's a topic that many are interested in. I will come back to this near the end around the look forward and talking a little bit more about the forward outlook for Phoenix. So these initial comments are really focused on the first quarter of 2013.","So if you look on Slide 8, similar to what we talked about before, the best information that we have is the historical C.H. Robinson global forwarding net revenue for 2012 of $28 million combined with the acquired historic revenue for this quarter in 2012 from Phoenix of $36.8 million of net revenue. So the way we're analyzing the business and holding ourselves accountable at the base of $64.9 million of net revenue in both of the businesses. The combined operation for 2013 has $67.8 million of net revenue or a 4.5% increase for the quarter.","When we think about the integration process, we foreshadowed a little bit in the last call kind of how we're thinking about global forwarding and what we're focused on, and the fact that it was going to be a couple of year integration period. If you look at the first 5 months, so November, December, in the first quarter of this year, our primary focus has really been to make sure that we retain the customers and the employees and the business processes that we paid for and that we think are very valuable. So in these early innings of the integration of Phoenix International, our primary focus really is at this net revenue line item. We feel very good about retaining the customers. We feel very good about the combined leadership team. A lot of the effort in the first 5 months was really focused on establishing the combined leadership team and offices.","So a couple of data points there. On November 1 of last year, on the acquisition date, there were 75 Phoenix offices that we acquired. There were about 65 offices in the Robinson network that were predominantly focused on international air, ocean and customs services. So that makes 140 offices on closing date. And there are about 25% of the offices. So right around 35 out of those 140 offices where they were located in the same city between Robinson and Phoenix International.","So our integration plan is that we are combining those offices. As of the end of the first quarter, about 10 or 10 of the 35 have been combined. So I referenced earlier that we're managing it as one business. In the first 5 months, 10 of the 35 offices have been physically combined. The other offices began immediately co-loading or sharing opportunities where they could. We also put significant effort into combining and realigning the agent strategies around the rest of the world without worrying about which office it benefited or where it went into in terms of Phoenix versus historic Robinson. And we also made all of the decisions from a leadership standpoint in terms of how those offices and regions would be run, and have announced all of those leadership decisions.","Another significant effort was really working with the service providers, the steamship lines, primarily on the ocean side, to make sure that we combined the volumes of the 2 businesses. And those of you are familiar with it, in February, March, April time frame is when a lot of the negotiations goes on for those contracts. So making sure that we had a good expectation of combined volumes and negotiating service contracts that provided the right kinds and caliber of capacity for the combined business.","So that's what we feel we've accomplished so far. We feel like all of those have gone very well. We feel like the cultural fit between the 2 businesses is very positive. We feel good about the leadership team. We feel good about the market receptiveness, the customer retention and what we'll be able to accomplish by combining the 2 businesses together. While there's a lot of potential for internal focus in all of that, we feel like not only retaining all that business but growing our volumes and improving our net revenue 4.5% during pretty soft market conditions is something that we're fairly proud of.","So the overall message on the Phoenix integration is a lot happening, a lot left to happen, but we feel pretty good in the first 5 months. I would say the thing that's going to take the longest from an integration standpoint is the integration of both the information systems and the financial reporting processes that are adjacent to that. We talked last time and still believe that, that's going to take probably an additional 18 months for us to get through those. And again, I'll come back in the end around kind of our overall performance and expectations for the future around the Phoenix transaction.","So if you go to Slide 9, the global forwarding results for ocean, air and customs.","As we mentioned a couple of times, this is breaking out customs for the first time from the other logistics services so that you can see it. And then here, these variation comments of significant increases in all categories are primarily from the acquired revenues, but also some good examples of specific organic wins and growth in each of the areas.","Moving on to Slide 10, and other logistics services.","This is one of our higher growth areas, which includes the transportation management services and a lot of the fee-based activities that we've been investing heavily in. So it's really the foundation of additional services and capabilities that tie together the transportation services into those relationships where we're offering integrated services in the marketplace.","So we feel very good about how we're positioned in this area to bundle the transportation offerings that we have, but also to provide technology-based services and other management services fees that we think will be a greater and greater portion of our future going forward.","A big part of that is a focus in investment in global transportation management as we see more and more of our larger customers focusing in on global procurement and global supply chain metrics, and we're investing in making sure that all of our continents and all of our information can come together in aggregated control towers.","Lastly, from a service line standpoint, with regards to sourcing, our sourcing net revenues declined 0.3% in the first quarter. While we had a 6% case volume and an increase in our volume activity, some weather effect around -- largely around rain in categories like asparagus and various vegetable categories did negatively impact our net revenue growth as we've talked before. While we're primarily focused on adding value through the sourcing and distribution of those commodities, we do take some margin risk around the commitments that we make. And occasionally, weather will have a negative or positive impact on the amount of margin that we realize.","So those are the prepared comments by service line. At this point, I'll turn it back to Tim for some prepared comments on Page 12 around our financial statements.","Tim Gagnon","Okay. Thanks, John. And as mentioned, I am starting on Slide 12, and there's a lot here. And John touched on it earlier, and I'm going to try to go through some of the important measures to call out on this page.","And I'll start with just emphasizing some of the things John had already mentioned in terms of our net revenue growth in total, or the actual net revenue growth of 9.9% in quarter 1 and then the pro forma net revenue growth adjusted for T-Chek and Phoenix at 3.8%.","To talk a little bit about our income from operations, as John had mentioned earlier, I want to take us into that a little bit, and I'll be reflecting both on the pro forma numbers, as well as some of the events that impacted the actual numbers for 2013.","So the first thing to point out is, and John had touched on this earlier, that the pro forma 2012 operating income as a percent of net revenue was 38.3% in 2012 versus 37% in 2013. That 1.3% variance is largely attributable to an increase in our personnel expense. Our personnel expense did grow faster than net revenues in the first quarter.","And I want to highlight one exceptional event that happened in January of 2013, where we had delivered the vested portion of the restricted stock awards from 2005. As of 2005, our executives, directors and general managers received awards once every 3 years. And as a result of that, the size of the awards was larger than for the participants who received awards annually. In most years, the payroll tax expense for the deliveries was about $1 million. But in quarter 1 this year, the payroll tax expense was $4 million in the quarter. So a difference of $3 million that had an impact on that elevated personnel expense number here in 2013.","Now, we'll have normal deliveries for the next 2 years in the first quarter. And then in 2016, we'll have another large delivery for a similar type of event.","So also, a couple of additional comments regarding 2013 income from operations as a percent of net revenue. We estimate that Phoenix increased our consolidated personnel expense as a percent of net revenue, approximately 1%. We've shared that number in the past as a result of their operating income as a percent of net revenue being less than the historical Robinson business.","We also -- I also should note that acquisition operations and additional purchase price amortization tallied approximately $4 million in quarter 1.","So that's a quick run through of Slide 12 and our 2013 actual compared to 2012 actual and pro forma numbers.","Moving to Slide 13, in some of the other financial information. I'll review this slide from the top left to the bottom right. So starting in the top left.","Our net cash declined in quarter 1 as a result of a tax payment on the gain of the sale of T-Chek in 2012. That tax payment was $108 million in quarter 1. Quarter 1 is typically a lower cash flow quarter for us. And you can see the large swing in cash there as a result of that tax payment. Our net capital expenditures were just over $10 million for the quarter. We do expect our capital expenditures to be around -- from $45 million to $50 million in 2013.","Moving to the right, our effective tax rate was 38.7% in quarter 1. That's a bit above our expected rate range of 38% to 38.5%. The variance there was largely caused by a change in the tax law on the state of California that changed the law in terms of how corporations must apportion their income for corporate income tax purposes. The law change causes us to source more of our income to California than under the previous law. So based on this, and this will be a change going forward as well, our expected tax rate going forward will be in the range from 38.25 to 38.75. So we've moved it up 0.25 as a result of this change.","In the bottom left, a couple of highlights on the balance sheet. We have approximately $160 million of cash and debt of approximately $390 million at quarter-end. And in the lower right corner, talk a little bit about our repurchases of common stock. We've repurchased just over 1.5 million shares in quarter 1. This is a higher amount than our typical first quarter, and I'll explain some of the details around that.","So on the left side of that chart labeled repurchase, we show 851,555 shares purchased on the open market at $58.10. And the column labeled withheld on deliveries represent shares withheld from the restricted stock delivery in January that we had mentioned earlier. When restricted shares are delivered to the participants, the participants owe withholding taxes based on the value of the shares at the time of the delivery. Our grant agreements require us to withhold these shares based on the terms of our award agreement. As a result, we deliver the net number of shares after withholding tax to the participants' accounts, and the shares that have been withheld are treated as a repurchase of stock from the participants. And the funds from the deemed repurchase are paid to the government to cover the withholding tax obligation.","Moving on to Slide 14, and a bit of a transition from the quarterly results into a perspective over time. In the chart labeled over time, our performance over time, you see some of the key metrics that we look at in our business from total revenue, net revenue, net income and earnings per share. And John reflected on the tough environment that we've been in over the last couple of quarters. But we also pay close attention to our performance over time, and our decisions are often reflective of good balance between the environment we're in currently, as well as consideration for the long-term of our business.","So in looking at our business over time, you can see from this graph that we're really proud of our growth over time. And in particularly, in the past 5 years where we've been able to achieve growth in lieu of a very difficult environment, from the 5 years from 2007 through 2012 year-end, we've grown our gross revenues 9.2% during that time, 6.7% net revenue growth, 7.2% operating income and 8.2% in earnings per share. And though our near-term results are not to our expectations, our long-term growth and our growth in a very difficult environment over the last 5 years is something that we do feel good about and we're proud of here as we reflect on a more long-term perspective.","So with that being said, I'm going to turn it back over to John to close with some comments around Q2 and 2013 as a whole.","John P. Wiehoff","Okay. Thank you, Tim. Our last slide is Page 15 titled, A Look Ahead, just a handful of bullets to comment on here before we open it up for Q&A.","The first is just a reminder that our T-Chek comparisons will remain a variance through the remainder of the year. All of the information is available in the pro forma filings. And just in case you weren't aware or hadn't focused it in, our pro forma information will be presented for the next several quarters similar to how we have this time.","Moving back then to Phoenix International and kind of talking a little bit forward-focused about our global forwarding business and what our thoughts and expectations are around the Phoenix International acquisition and how we're thinking about things.","When you look at 2012, the combined net revenue of Robinson and Phoenix for calendar 2012 is just shy of $300 million. So that earlier slide, that was comparing the historic base for 2012 and how we're doing forward, will aggregate to about $300 million of net revenue for the year in international air, ocean and customs. So that's our baseline and will be the primary measurement metric for this year as we focus on retaining current accounts and managing the combined businesses to serve the customers.","So we believe that we can grow the global forwarding business over time at a double-digit net revenue rate. It's going to start out a little bit slower as we become more aggressive around cross-selling, consolidating and expanding our network. We do think that we can accelerate that growth rate. Net revenue growth will be a key metric for us, and accordingly, we've broken that out, including the customs brokerage piece so that we'll all have clean visibility to our baseline and understanding the top line of the forwarding services going forward.","We think that the net revenue growth will be the primary measure of how we're succeeding in market share gains and how we're doing in serving our customers. We obviously are hoping for a little bit of market strengthening, which would be helpful to us, when we made that investment decision to acquire Phoenix. Our growth plans were not based on a return to market conditions of double-digit growth, but more to the mid single-digit growth that many are forecasting. And we think we can use our scale and the combined business to improve our margins and increase our market share by selling and further expanding our network to get to that double-digit growth.","As far as profitability is concerned, our baseline measurement has always been our branch offices and the branch P&Ls. Phoenix has a similar culture, and one of the many positive fits about our teams was that focus on branches, general managers and branch P&Ls. We will continue to measure and manage the business with branch P&Ls, and empower general managers to run their own business.","Under our one global network concept, we will continue to emphasize greater coordination and interaction of the offices, balanced with the local customization and integration of whatever services that the customers want. So while each of our branch offices is unique, with a unique combination of services, shared account, freight mix, et cetera, we're constantly evolving our profit-sharing calculations and processing -- our processes for managing the shared accounts and overhead allocations across that network.","While the branch P&L is the foundation, we also analyze our activity by profitability for region, service line, customer, operating center, however else we can. So we've shared in the past that our offices primarily engaged in global forwarding services were not nearly as profitable as the company as a whole. And given our relative scale and market presence, our earnings from those offices also fluctuated much more than the other service lines.","That was a big consideration in our decision to invest in Phoenix International. As you can see on Slide 3 in our presentation deck, while the historic profitability levels of Phoenix were at approximately 30% of net revenue for operating income, the purchase accounting amortization will lower those reported earnings. The net effect of all this, that our baseline of $300 million of net revenue, our best estimate of the profitability is somewhere around 10% to 15% prior to any additional integration spending.","Our longer-term 3- to 5-year goal is to grow our earnings in those office in excess of the net revenue growth by increasing our operational discipline, leveraging our bigger platform and using our Navisphere platform to drive efficiency. As we achieve that operational alignment and systems consolidation in the first 2 years, then we'll begin to drive greater leveraging of the cost. We'll continue to analyze and share with you in future periods how we assess the combined profitability of the offices, but the actual metrics we use will depend somewhat on how integrated or separate the offices become. And our enterprise level operating income, the net revenue will probably always be the best metric to see how we're progressing as a whole.","Our overall goal for the 5 years is to have a global forwarding network of offices that's somewhere between $500 million and $600 million of net revenue, with estimated profitability approaching back to that 30% operating income of net revenue. The network would stand alone and offer independent international forwarding services, but also be a key pillar of the integrated logistics services that we've been working very hard on. If we get anywhere as close to that level of success in achieving our goals, we think the return on investment on the acquisition will be really good and we'll feel very positive about it.","So that's some insight into our thought process of how we're looking at the integration, how we're holding ourselves accountable and what the key metrics will be to deliver on that.","The next point around truckload margin compression remaining a challenge. I tried to do a little bit more thorough job of kind of laying out the broader market conditions that we're seeing. And I guess part of the point is that while in March and April, we're seeing some leveling of our truckload net revenue margins in North America, it's really primarily driven by some easing of comparisons with the prior year as opposed to us seeing any significant shift in the overall marketplace.","We understand better now looking at our history that high periods of growth with price increases, inflation, dislocation in the market, new capacity coming in and being conditioned to the marketplace, all of those things provide more growth, as well as more transactional opportunity for us. We strongly believe that those markets will return at some point. I don't know when, I know everybody's been hoping for that for the last couple of years, but while we did see some improvement in the net revenue margins in March, as I said a couple of times, it's really more about year-over-year comparisons rather than a belief that we've seen a shift in the market conditions that have made growth a little bit more difficult.","Lastly, we've talked about this before, but just in terms of our overall philosophy of growing the business, we do feel that for a long-term value creation like on the slide that Tim referenced and when we talked internally, that it's really important that we continue to take market share and generate the scale of the business. And that when we're in a more difficult environment like this, we're not going to do things that we don't believe we can't get a reasonable return on, but that we do err towards the side of making sure that we continue to aggressively sell and go after volume growth and market share gains in the marketplace. And through that, we acknowledge that we do have a lot of productivity challenges that we're tackling head on and taking a very aggressive approach towards making sure that we continue to lower our overall cost of operations, and making sure that we maintain that competitive advantage of having the best processes and being able to be very effective in the marketplace.","So there's a lot that happened in this first quarter and a lot of changes going on in the business, and we changed a few things in our reporting. So we took a little bit more time to talk through all of that, but at this point, we'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Rob Salmon on for Justin. John, in your prepared remarks, it sounded like the -- obviously, the conversion rate on the Phoenix side of the acquisition is being constrained by the purchase price accounting. It sounds like that the net revenue margin conversion had been 30% beforehand and it's now kind of in the low double-digit range. When we look out over that 5-year plan, how quickly do you expect to ramp up back to that 30% net revenue margin on the global forwarding business? And can you give us a sense where the base is today from the 2 companies combined?","John P. Wiehoff","Yes, so a couple of other data points on that. We're still understanding and putting together the seasonality of it too. So one of the things that we'll learn this year, if you see in the historic numbers, both Phoenix and our net revenue is greater in the second and third quarters, and the level of variable operating expense is a little bit less than the global forwarding business. So when you look at operating income to net revenue, there probably will be more quarterly variance on the global forwarding than there will be on the rest of the business through the purchase accounting. So there's $4 million a quarter or about $16 million a year of amortization expense that will run for about 8 years. So today, that amortization expense is reducing the Phoenix reported income as a percent of net revenue by a pretty meaningful amount. If we achieve that $500 million to $600 million of net revenue, that $16 million a year of amortization out in year 5 would represent about 2% to 3% of net revenue. So our goal in 5 years is to get back to the high 20s, 27%, 27.5%, hopefully better than that if we can -- that's probably the high water standard now for some of the world-class forwarders, and we think Phoenix International was doing a pretty good job. So if we can get back to that level with amortization in there, the operating income would be kind of in the mid-20s. I mentioned in my prepared comments that our historic business was not nearly as profitable, and that probably that 10% to 15% range is probably a good baseline for both the Phoenix business because of the purchase accounting and integration costs, and for us due to less profitability in our history. I didn't talk a lot about the integration costs above and beyond that, but one of the things that we covered in the last call, and I think is important to understand as well, too, that our approach towards the integration of this is that while we're spending a significant amount of time and energy to put the offices together and put the systems together, it's really not possible for us to get a nice, clean, quantified determination of what that integration spending is right now. So while we know that our shared services like IT and finance and legal and HR, it's the #1  priority and probably the top resource allocation in all of those groups that we're spending north of $150 million a year on as combined companies. Every single person in those groups is probably touching this in one form or another, but it was really not possible for us to break out exactly how much additional integration spending is hitting us from that standpoint. And a lot of is re-prioritization of personnel cost that is really just an opportunity cost rather than an additional hard dollar.","Tim Gagnon","I'm going to take this opportunity, this is Tim, just to mention that we do have to limit to 1 question per caller just to try to get as many folks as we can on today. And please feel free to follow up with me to get some time scheduled as a follow-up. So thank you, Rob, for that, and we'll move along to the next caller here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe if you can just kind of jump into on the core truckload business where you talk about your rates going up 1.5% and the costs going up 2.5%. Can you delve into -- it's been 6 quarters now where you've seen that underperform your cost. What do you have to do to get that at least to break even on a cost relative to your place basis?","John P. Wiehoff","I think there's a couple of relevant points there. One is if you look back, and part of the reason why I put that 10-year history in there that when you look over the last 3 or 4 years, part of our challenge is coming off of historic highs from a margin standpoint that we knew were unsustainable in 2009. We're very short on the buy side as we've talked about before. So our cost of capacity is moving pretty quickly. And those margins expanded quite a bit. So whatever changes in the marketplace and competitive factors there are, those are all being blurred in with coming off of unsustainably high margins that have put that together. When you think about, where do we go from here? Like I said, we've seen some leveling in the current periods, so hopefully, it will be less of a factor going forward. But the main thing is that you've got the supply side who's not adding a lot of capacity and pushing really hard on yield. And you've got shippers who are very focused on stability and grinding out rates. We just need some leverage in the marketplace around more capacity coming in or more growth on the demand side where you have more rate negotiation and leverage to make a change. So we hope we're seeing that soon, but it's the combination of all that stuff that I rambled on around that's impacting the market conditions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I want to make sure I understood you right, and then I have my question. So the net revenue of the forwarding business is expected to grow from a base of, say, $300 million today to $500 million to $600 million over the next 5 to 6 years, did I hear that correctly?","John P. Wiehoff","You did, so 15% growth would roughly have a double in 5 years, and so double-digit growth would put it between $500 million to $600 million.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So I guess I want to make sure I understand the components of that growth because I don't think the market's growing at that pace. It doesn't sound like the entire CH network of customers can be harvested for this business. And it also sounds like it's a little bit headcount-intensive at some point, so how do personnel costs not grow in line with that growth rate? So that's -- how do we get there, I guess, is the question.","John P. Wiehoff","So what I tried to lay out in my prepared thoughts is that our long-term hope or forecast in the market conditions is mid-single-digit growth. That was the analysis that we came up with versus the double-digit growth that was maybe happening over the decades where things were growing much faster. So I recognize that the market is not there today, but our hope is that we do, over the next year or so, return to more normal market conditions of single -- mid-single-digit growth. We do feel that there are significant opportunities to cross-sell both the international services to the Robinson customer base, as well as improve our margins through better rate negotiation, better consolidation opportunities, as well as expanding our network in Europe and other parts of Asia where we don't have a presence today. So it's the combination of all that, that says that we feel we can grow our net revenue at 10 -- or double digits for that 5-year target. When you look at the expense structure, what we've talked about is that rather than taking people out and trying to squeeze operating expenses out of the network today, we recognize that we are carrying costs through integration that we hope to be able to leverage in the future so that we can grow our business and not have to add the operating cost or the people to drive operating income growth greater than the net revenue growth once we get past the integration phase.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of William Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","John, I'm curious about your views on how long you think you sort of have patience for the kind of performance we're seeing in terms of -- really, I'm talking about the bottom line growth rate. Because for a while, we've heard, well, it's the market, and we've got a way for things to come back and we did an acquisition, but there are some onetime things here that are not leading to the growth. How much patience do you sort of have? Because it's been a while since we've seen growth rates that Robinson used to perform at. So I'm curious when the moment arrives when you finally say to the team, we've got to start taking actions internally here and not wait for the market.","John P. Wiehoff","I think that was 2 years ago. Well, implied in your question is that we're okay with this or that we're being patient about it, I don't think that's the case at all. There are a number of different sales and productivity initiatives across the North American network that I feel like we've been very aggressive on. I feel like the investment and divestiture that we made last year was directly related to repositioning ourselves to greater scale and adapting to a more competitive market. We've put a number of different initiatives in place. I mean, in these calls, we're trying to explain our thought process and what we're observing. But if you look at -- I mean, we do have this foundation of a variable business model and pay for performance that causes a certain amount of immediate reaction in the lesser performance where we're all feeling the pain in the last couple of years. Trust me, that's not gone unnoticed within the company. And there are a lot of different initiatives. And I would say, probably the most aggressive thing is really, the integrated logistics selling where in this more aggressive environment, we've push very hard with a lot of the customers around return on investment, selling and focusing more on integrated services, where it's a little bit more complex, but it ties us to the customer a little bit better and it feels like that's probably more what our future is about. I don't know if there are other examples or thoughts around your word patience, but I feel like we have been trying to react fairly aggressively.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It was just a comment on -- a lot of it relates to market and what's going -- we need this in the market to happen, that in the market to happen. And at some point, it's sort of like, okay, I get that, but what are you going to do now? And you've outlined some things and maybe I'm reacting to the Midwest mentality, and you sound so nice about it that maybe it's that. But I just sort of feel like the markets, sort of the investors are waiting to see a return to those growth rates and we haven't gotten there. And so it's kind of like, well, when? What's that date? And I guess that was the point of the question, but I appreciate your thoughts.","John P. Wiehoff","It's a fair point, so thank you for making it. And I do feel like if you look at our EPS growth over the last 5 years, it's been 8%, 8.5%, something like that, so it hasn't been to our long-term targets. Some of that is coming off of those high comparisons and some of it is because we believe we're in a little bit different market condition. So we're not sitting around waiting for the markets to change. Some inflation, some growth, some increase in demand would be a very good thing for us, but if we never see that, if we never see improvement and it just continues to contract, at some point, we have to hit bottom on margin comparisons and get to the point where our volume growth and our activity will equate more with our earnings growth. And in the meantime, we've got analyst initiatives around integrating the services, leveraging our scale and trying to make sure that we're enhancing our productivity so that if it is an environment of sustained margins, that we'll continue to have earnings growth more in line with our volume growth rather than the 8% that we've had the last 5 years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess when you think about the transport margin, I know you said it was difficult to kind of break out maybe what the core underlying C.H. Robinson transportation margin looked like x Phoenix, but I guess, maybe directionally, as I think longer-term or towards kind of obviously at the trough end of the long-term chart that you put up on Slide 4, I guess, when you think about the underlying business itself -- I mean this is a broad question, but how do you think about where this goes? I mean it seems with larger customers, there might be further pressure to the downside here. Is it possible that we could be seeing kind of a new normalization in this? I know the market has been different the last couple of years, but just kind of curious if that should change.","John P. Wiehoff","There's definitely, as we've suggested a number of times, there's certainly the possibility that it's a new era and a new environment where some of the margins never return to what the historic averages would be. However, when you look at it at an enterprise level like this, there's such a diverse mixture of stuff with ocean and air and LTL and consolidation services where margins can vary quite a bit depending upon your density and your success level from it. Included in those transportation margins are the 100% margin fee-based business for the integrated services and the technology fees and the stuff that's growing pretty significantly. So when we think about the future and the margins and what sort of productivity levels we need to be at to sustain our high levels of return on investment and where we're at, it's making sure that customer-by-customer, office-by-office, service-by-service, that we're taking the right approach of blending all that in to make sure that we keep our returns acceptable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask you along the lines of the competitive dynamic in truck brokerage. And I think one of the things we've seen from some of your competitors, and I think you've maybe experienced this as well, that in order to see the volume growth, you've had to take greater risk in the market. And so one way, I think, of maybe looking at more of the route guide business and making more contractual commitments, which gives you a bit more risk on filling the capacity side. You think that's a fair characterization? Is that still where the market's at? And do you think that would continue to be the case, that if you really want to grow volumes, that you just are forced by the competitive environment to take more risk on the gross margin side?","John P. Wiehoff","That is definitely a trend. I think it really goes back even way prior to the last 3 or 4 years. So really, over the last 20 years, we have evolved our business from more of a pure transactional broker to where we are, a core carrier in the route guide. And even up to 4, 5 years ago when we talked to upwards of half of our business being in that more committed or dedicated framework, where you do have a little bit more margin risk but you also have much more volume certainty that you can work with. Over the last 3 or 4 years, when we make statements like the world has become more committed and less transactional, and route guide compliance is very high, your choices around taking market share for all of us are more within that route guide, around the planned freight and the dedicated stuff that generally comes with a price commitment or as part of a bid. So it is absolutely true what you're saying, that as the market has shifted to more predictable dedicated freight, those of us who are trying to take market share, that's really the only logical place to go get it. But as I said earlier, I think that is part of the broader transformation of the percentage of the marketplace that third parties have been able to address in the last couple of decades by moving into aggregation of capacity and being that core carrier provider that we are with a lot of our large shippers.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I guess to be more specific on that though, so do you -- that's been the case, but do you think that continues in that percent that's contractual, would continue to increase going forward?","John P. Wiehoff","If the market stays the way it is, yes, it would. And then, as we've talked before, the goal around that would be with those higher volume shippers, you can do things to align more committed capacity. You can automate the process and make it more predictable so that your operating income per shipment can improve. So it's a slightly different business model around how we would think about efficiency and profitability, but if the market stays tighter with slower growth, more controlled, yes, there will be a greater and greater percentage of the freight that operates under that model.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","So just a couple of things I want to clarify and then I had a question. First, in terms of the new reporting on truckload versus LTL, that's pretty helpful. Maybe just for all of us, if you have any history on that, that you can give us, that'd be great. And on the call, do you have any sense on what that truckload net revenue growth was last quarter and maybe for the full year '12?","Tim Gagnon","We haven't decided, Scott, that we're going to share that yet. It's something that we should talk more about here. We more prepared that information for this quarter, here in Q1, so...","John P. Wiehoff","And also understand that part of our reluctance to break it out in the past was that there are some definitional variances across our network around perishable freight and what's included in LTL and truckload. And part of what we've been working on the last few years is to make sure that we've had consistent definitions around how we categorize our freight so that we can break it out. So part of the decision tree on sharing history is whether or not it's actually consistent for you to compare to.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Got you, okay. And then, John, I'm not sure if I missed it. Did you give what truckload volumes and net revenue was tracking through April like you've done in past calls?","John P. Wiehoff","I did not. I just shared that we are continuing to see more consistent net revenue margin year-over-year, but that we're not seeing an acceleration in demand in the marketplace.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","So we should be thinking about transport net revenue margins that are flatfish and -- flattish year-over-year in the second quarter?","John P. Wiehoff","I'm sorry, what exactly did you say?","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","So transportation margin percents that you're saying are pretty flat year-over-year compared with second quarter?","John P. Wiehoff","I was talking specifically about North American truckload, and that the net revenue margin percentage was consistent with the previous April.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And just in terms of my longer-term question, you've been talking on the past few calls about slow leasing, about using more leverage on the balance sheet. And I wanted to know if you can just give us an update on how you're thinking about the balance sheet and buybacks going forward.","John P. Wiehoff","The capital policy that we've been operating under for the last couple of quarters that we'll continue to review as we go forward is that we are maintaining our 90% to 100% capital distribution philosophy through both the dividend payout ratio that we have of around 40%, as well as the share purchase activity that for the last 5 years has brought us up to that 90% to 100%. So despite the fact that we have some debt and we have it approved up to $1 billion, we do expect to continue to execute that high return on capital model of dividend and share repurchases like we have in the past. From an overall financing standpoint, we're constantly looking at the amount of dry powder and the pipeline of M&A opportunities. And we've been approved to go up to $1 billion of debt within that framework, and we'll keep looking at the market conditions in our pipeline and figuring out whether we accelerate or pull back our buyback activity from there.","Tim Gagnon","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, February 5, 2013. I'd like to turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Gagnon","Thank you. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, Chief Executive Officer; and Chad Lindbloom, Chief Financial Officer. Chad and John will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year performance and we will follow that with a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate our discussion. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at chrobinson.com. Chad and John will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments.","Finally, I'd like to remind you that comments made by Chad, John or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Chad.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Thanks, Tim, and thank all of you for taking the time to listen to our fourth quarter earnings call. We released our earnings after market today. Our release contains adjusted numbers and provides a reconciliation of these numbers to GAAP. On today's call, we are going to focus on these adjusted numbers so we thought we should start with an explanation of the adjustments. Slide 3 shows our fourth quarter and year actual GAAP results, then a column showing the nonrecurring transaction amounts and finally, the third column for each of those time periods is the adjusted amounts, which we will be focusing today's conversations on.","Moving to explain each of the adjustments, the $34.6 million adjustment to personnel expense is made up primarily of $33 million of incremental vesting expense of our equity awards triggered by the gain on the sale of T-Chek. The majority of our equity expense is based on the average of operating income growth and earnings per share growth. The gain had a significant impact to earnings per share as shown on our GAAP financial statements. The balance of the non-recurring personnel expense is made up entirely of transaction-related bonuses, primarily made to T-Chek employees. The adjustments to other operating expenses are made up entirely of fees paid to third parties. These fees covered the investment banking fees related to the acquisition of T-Chek, external legal and accounting fees related to the acquisitions of Phoenix -- I'm sorry, the investment banking fees were related to the acquisition of Phoenix, the external legal and accounting fees were related to the acquisitions of Phoenix, Apreo and the divestiture of T-Chek. The adjustments to investment and other income is the gain from the divestiture of T-Chek.","When comparing Q4 2012 adjusted to Q4 2011, the results still are not entirely comparable. Quarter 4 of 2012 includes 16 days of T-Chek's operations and 2 months of Phoenix operations. Quarter 4 of 2011 includes T-Chek operations for the full quarter and obviously no Phoenix activity.","With that explanation of the adjusted results, I will turn it over to John to review the results of the service lines for the quarter.","John P. Wiehoff","Okay, thank you, Chad. So my prepared comments will start on Page 4 and as Chad indicated, I'll be comparing last year to our adjusted numbers for 2012. I'll start by pointing out that our total revenues for the quarter grew 15.7% and the consolidated net revenues grew 10.8% for the quarter.","Similar to the past several quarters, the difference between that gross revenue and net revenues was driven by net revenue margin compression. Our income from operations grew 3.3% for the quarter. As Chad mentioned, some of the unusual factors to reconcile to that, and he will comment again later on some of the impacts to income from operations in our SG&A analysis.","From an overall results standpoint, I guess I want to highlight a few of the enterprise metrics that we focus on, since a key part of our growth story and strategy is to continue to take market share, the fact that our full year 2012 truckload volume growth was 10% is meaningful to us and does reflect our belief that we continue to take market share. We also track the scope of our relationships in terms of the active number of customers, which you see increased to 42,000 and the active number of carriers and suppliers that we engaged with during the year, that increased to 56,000. Chad commented on the fact that there's still, in these adjusted numbers, is some variances in the comparisons, largely due to Phoenix and T-Chek. Leaving Phoenix in the 2012 numbers as an ongoing operations, if you did exclude T-Chek from both the 2011 and '12 numbers, those adjusted net revenue numbers would have grown net revenues by 14% for the quarter, year-over-year and it would have grown income from operations as 6.5%. There's a lot of different ways to analyze our results for the quarters, given the transactions that we have, but we think those are the relevant ways to think about it.","I do have some prepared comments by each of the service lines that I will share. But before I go into that, on Page 5 of the deck, there's just a handful of a bullet points, kind of recapping what we think the highlights of 2012 were to call to your attention. The first series of bullets there in the aggregate, we refer to as the strategic realignment, I think were very important to us this year because we had separate conversations around each of them at the time of the transactions. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on them, but to generalize or to summarize each of them, the Phoenix International acquisition was an investment in Global Forwarding, a business that we've been offering for about 20 years, but realized that scale is very important, and we think it's going to allow us to be much more competitive. We're 90 days into our Phoenix integration. When I get into the Air and Ocean service lines, I'll make some more comments on that. But overall, we were attracted to the cultural fit of the company and feel very good about that 90 days into the transaction.","The T-Chek divestiture, we talked about the consolidation in the Payment Services industry that's occurring, and why we chose not to continue to invest capital and our time and resources in that business. Lastly, we talked throughout 2012 about our commitment to Europe. Despite an overall difficult environment in Europe, we do have very high expectations for the long-term about what our presence can be there and replicating a lot of our services.","During 2012, we made some leadership investments by placing some of our key people over there to continue to drive our growth, as well as making the Apreo acquisition in Poland.","So together, those 3 transactions helped reposition us in a way that, we believe, will allow us focus on integrated transportation and logistics offerings in a more narrow way with some greater scale and concentration in some of our key service offerings.","In terms of other highlights or challenges for 2012, I would also share what I said earlier that we continue to grow our market share in most everything we do and felt good about that. We continue to aggressively sell and develop our relationships and apply the account management practices that we think are really important to our long-term success. Lastly, on the challenges, we talked about continued truckload margin compression and really a transportation margin compression, which is probably a fairly simple term of outcome for a lot of interrelated topics. In each of the service line sections, I'll make some comments and refer back to it again. But in terms of growing our revenues and market presence at a greater rate than we've been able to grow our earnings the last couple of years, net revenue margin compression continues to be the core topic that we're challenged with.","So moving on to Page 6 on the deck, commenting about our overall transportation results. One of the things that we've added the last couple of years to try to put things into context is that 10-year net revenue margin percentage for transportation. So you can see that our net revenue margin comparison for the fourth quarter of 2012 and for the year again represented net revenue margin compression for us. Volumes were up in nearly all of our services in Q4. And there was some meaningful mix shift due to the transactions that we talked about with regards to Air and Ocean growing faster in the quarter.","Moving on to Page 7, the truck results that include truckload and less-than-truckload. Our North American truckload volume increased 8% in the fourth quarter. Because of the acquisition of Apreo and high volumes of shorter haul truckload transactions, our overall truckload volume growth in the fourth quarter was 12%. And as I mentioned earlier, 10% volume growth year-to-date, which is a key metric for us. On the truckload part of the net revenue margin compression, similar to some past quarters, we had revenue increases from our customers, exclusive of fuel, around 1% and our cost prior increased something closer to 2%. Our less-than-truckload volume continued to increase at a nice percentage of 16%, and we had some modest net revenue margin compression in the LTL area as well.","Moving to Page 8, similar story to some past quarters. We are evolving, transforming that business. We, like the industry, has moved to a much more dedicated large customer business with less transactional pricing. So our volume was up again for the quarter, but pretty meaningful net revenue decline due to the transformation of the business to a higher percentage of business with large customers at lesser margins.","Moving to Page 9 for the Ocean and Air results is where you begin to see some of the impact of the Phoenix acquisition that we've referenced several times. I'll talk a little bit about how we're approaching that and the impacts that you'll see. I think one of the things that's very important to understand about our approach to the Phoenix acquisition and our integration strategy is that we are moving fairly quickly to combine the operations. If you look at, for the 2 months of 2012, we were able to get a reasonable approximation of how the legacy C.H. Robinson global forwarding offices would have performed, which is the up 3% for Ocean services and approximately 19% for Air services. This is the last quarter that we anticipate being able to even estimate that number. If you look at what we've accomplished in the first 90 days of our integration, already, some of the metrics are being blurred as we're managing our global forwarding business through 1 network. Things like rerouting and combining freight that are handled -- that is handled by our agents, we've already begun to consolidate and co-load freight in some locations. There have been a few office combinations already, with a few more planned. We've combined our service contract and routing activities, and that will continue to accelerate in March and April with new contracts and some modest account realignment that will continue through our enterprise account management practices as well, too.","So we believe we're off to a good start, with the integration of that acquisition. And going forward, it really will be a combined Air and Ocean activity with hopefully meaningful increases in the net revenue for both of them throughout 2013.","Moving to Page 10. The other logistics services, you see there that also includes some of the customs brokerage activity that was acquired. But separate from that, we have the core transportation management customs and small parcel services that have been a high-growth part of our business for a number of years, and those increased about 15% during the quarter. We continue to believe that as we sell integrated services and evolve the scope and complexity of what we offer to our customers that there is a lot of good growth opportunity in this area and that we hope to be able to continue to expand and grow these services.","Lastly, with regards to our sourcing business, you see net revenue for the quarter up 11.3%. Most of that net revenue growth came from volume growth with large customers. We haven't discussed a lot about our sourcing business in the past couple of years, but we do continue to stay very excited about some of the opportunities to innovate and add products and services in the sourcing area. That business today continues to principally constitute perishable fresh fruits and vegetables, examples during the quarter where we had some meaningful growth through new ideas and innovation came from melon varieties that we helped to introduce, as well as a couple of different packaging alternatives around bins for marketing and crating for corn. A lot of these produce commodity and sourcing transactions are integrated in with our temperature-controlled transportation that gets pre-reported on by the type of transportation service that is combined with it. But similar to our transportation services, the integrated offerings and the combined account management strategies are an important part of our future.","So with those prepared comments, I will now turn it back to Chad for some more statements in the financials.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Okay, thank you, John. Slide 12 is a summarized income statement comparing adjusted 2012 to 2011. For the fourth quarter, as John covered, our total net revenues grew to 10.8%. Our adjusted personnel expense grew faster than net revenues and it increased as a percentage of net revenues. We estimate that Phoenix increased our consolidated personnel to net revenue by approximately 1% for the quarter.","As discussed last year, quarter 4 had unusually low personnel expense to net revenue due to slowing earnings growth during 2011. This slowdown in growth drove significant reductions in certain expenses in the fourth quarter, resulting in a very low personnel as a percentage of net revenue. Other operating expenses increased primarily due to amortization of Phoenix. Our annual amortization expense is expected -- is going to be approximately $16.3 million for 8 years for the identifiable intangible assets acquired during the Phoenix acquisition.","Moving on to Slide 13. Our income from operations increased approximately 3.1% on an adjusted basis but our net income was down slightly. Our adjusted investment in other income was impacted by a lower average cash balance due to the acquisition, as well as some of debt for the last 2 months, which created interest expense as related to borrowings to partially finance the Phoenix acquisition.","Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was unusually low due to a favorable resolution of an uncertain tax position during the quarter, which reduced our tax contingency reserve requirements. Our effective rate for the fourth quarter of 2012 was slightly above our new expected rate of 38% to 38.75%. This unusually high amount was due partially to a loss in a particular country where we did not -- we're not able to book a tax benefit.","Moving on to Slide 14. We continue to have a strong balance sheet with approximately $210 million of cash and $254 million of debt. As I mentioned earlier, the debt was incurred to finance a portion of the Phoenix purchase price and this debt was obtained under our previously announced revolving debt facility. Our net CapEx for the quarter was approximately $12 million. We expect our 2013 CapEx to be approximately $55 million. Also during the fourth quarter of 2012, we repurchased approximately 1,453,000 shares at an average price of $61.92.","We're now going to move on to a discussion of some of our pro forma condensed, combined financial information.","On January 14, we filed an 8-K, which represents historic pro forma results of C.H. Robinson and Phoenix combined. We've received many questions about these pro formas, so we thought it would be a good idea to cover them on this call. We have slightly reformatted these income statements from the 8-K to a format similar to those presented in this earnings release.","While these historic results and ratios may or may not be a good indicator of future results, we do believe they provide a good point of reference. As you can see, Phoenix had a higher net revenue margin than CHR, there's about -- there was about 20% for the periods presented compared to the mid-teens for C.H. Robinson. This would have had a combined impact of 30 to 40 basis points compared to historic C.H. Robinson transportation net revenue margins. It is common for international forwarding services, including ours and others in the marketplace, to have a higher net revenue margin than C.H. Robinson's business mix as a whole.","Moving on to Slide 16, which shows some of the operating expense and operating income impacts of the combined financials. Had we owned Phoenix in the periods presented and the business performed how they did, our operating income as a percent of the net revenues would've been lower. As you can see, the annual amortization expense based on our purchase accounting is $16.3 million per year, or about 1% of the combined net revenues for the periods presented. Phoenix had operating income as a percentage of net revenue, excluding this amortization, of approximately 30%. CHRW was a little over 40%. Both their personnel and other operating expenses were a greater percentage of net revenues than C.H. Robinson's.","Like with discussions about net revenues on the previous slides, these historic results are not meant to be a prediction of the future, but again, we do believe they provide valuable information.","With that recap of the historic combined pro forma financial statements, I will turn it back to John for a look ahead to 2013.","John P. Wiehoff","Okay. So on our last slide, Page 17 in the deck, there are a handful of bullets for your consideration about forward-looking thinking and talking about 2013.","For the past couple of years on these conference calls, for most of them, we've been able to provide some current period data points around truckload volumes or daily net revenue growth to help you understand the trends or current changes in the business. With the changes in our business mix and integration activity that's going on, we do not have complete realtime data on any of those metrics, and we also have some meaningful mix shifts going on that were discussed throughout our fourth quarter results here. Given all that, we do not have January's books closed and we feel it would be more prudent to keep our comments to the directional insights of what we see happening in the business, as we integrate and get back to more Realtime information, we'll continue to reassess what we can share in the future.","From a directional standpoint, the North American truckload business is what we have the best visibility to on a daily basis. During the fourth quarter of 2012, October growth was our best; December finished very poorly; and January of 2013 began very weak, as well, from a both a volume and margin standpoint.","The month of January in 2013 for North American-only full truckload did finish with volume growth comparable to our 2012 results. Unfortunately, though, we did continue to have year-over-year margin compression during that period as well. We've shared this before but when you look at normal truckload activity for the first quarter of the year, it is a very common pattern that January has the lowest per-day volume and the highest margins. And throughout the quarter, it will generally trend down, with March being the busiest day -- or busiest month per day, as well as typically declining margins as the market will start to tighten up. Whether or not our truckload margins will drop in that pattern or drop steeper, still remains unknown. So while we did get off to a slow start in January, the most important part of the quarter for that component of our net revenues remains to be seen.","I referenced earlier the strategic alignment and the focus on the Air and Ocean and Global Forwarding business, the elimination of our Payment Services. Because of the financial reporting treatment that those transactions generated, we will continue to see T-Chek historical numbers in the prior year period for all of 2013. So as you look ahead and think about how our business will perform in the future, we will continue to see comparisons impacted by Payment Services throughout 2013. Chad referenced the over $16 million of amortization that will come in. And I spoke earlier about the integration approach to Phoenix, one of the things that's probably important to expand on that, if you look at how we're managing 1 network and what some of the key integration objectives are, at the core of it is the IT and systems integration, where we are taking our proprietary system and modifying it to close the gaps and make it workable for the entire network. While it's a pretty significant activity for us, it's all internal cost that are being re-prioritized and reassigned, and it will be impossible for us to create quantified measurement for that. But there's no question that we will be continuing to exert a lot of significant focus and cost towards the integration of Phoenix. When we closed that deal and every day since, we've continued to talk about this being a growth opportunity, that our focus while we will try to create cost synergies and make our business more efficient over time, we are very focused today on keeping our customers, continuing to serve them at a very high level and looking for the types of improvements that I referenced earlier around opportunities to put the networks together. So all of that said, with the growth part of it and the integration costs, we are very focused on the top line and growing our business and serving our customers on the global forwarding business in 2013.","I talked a couple of times now about net revenue margin compression, and the fact that we've had it for 3 years in a row now based on our transportation summary that we put out there. Just a thought that I'd like to share around that, as I said earlier, it's very difficult to predict what's going to happen in the market and what's going to happen with those net revenue margins. But one of the things that I think is important, if you look at how we've responded to these changes over the last 3 years and how we expect to continue to respond to the net revenue margin opportunities, is that we are very focused on taking market share and growing our business. When we think about all of the factors that come into the net revenue margin compression around a very balanced market for a sustained period of time, the mix shifts in the business to more dedicated, more intermodal, more static route guys with a lot of the shippers. When you look at the competitive factors and all of the technology changes that have occurred with shippers and electronic bids, we've received a lot of questions over the last couple of years about the impacts of all of those on our net revenue margins. And while it's very difficult or impossible to isolate or quantify the specific impact of any of those, we have made the clear choice that we are going to continue to grow our business. And if the market continues to be difficult and generate net revenue margin compression for us, our strategy is to accept the productivity challenges that come with that and continue to invest in our technology, in our account management and business process opportunities to make our model more effective and more competitive going forward.","So it's a difficult thing to predict. I know it's been a recurring topic for the last couple of years, and probably won't go away soon. But it is something that we feel like we're reacting to and that we have a plan to adjust our business and grow, and hopefully we'll see some market chances that will help it in the future.","Last couple of bullet points. We still see ourselves as the core competencies in a service organization driven by people and technology. We have plans to continue to invest aggressively in both of those in 2013. We're continuing to take a long-term approach towards recruiting the right type of people and training them and investing in the industry knowledge and competitive differences that we think will make a long-term difference. So we're going to continue to do that. We have some very exciting technology releases on our Navisphere platform and really converting, not only combining the global forwarding services, but all of our service offerings in a way that we think is pretty neat.","And the last point that I'll touch on is that throughout these transactions, we've talked about our capital structure and the longtime philosophy of no debt and we shared on the last call and wanted to reiterate again, Chad referenced the continued share repurchase activity in the quarter. We also announced a pretty meaningful dividend increase since our last conference call. And we do intend to continue to increase our dividends and accelerate or continue our share repurchase programs, and we're continuing to look for acquisition and investment opportunities. The net of which, while we haven't really defined any specific parameters, we do intend to move forward with a slightly more aggressive capital structure that we use our balance sheet a little bit to help our growth and help our diversification throughout these market changes.","That culminates our prepared comments for the fourth quarter and with that, we'll open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Nate Brochmann, William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Wanted to talk on a little bit, I mean, obviously you've given a lot of nice color around some of the pressures on the gross margins. But wanted to talk a little bit more specifically, like on the fourth quarter and then to what you've seen so far in January where, I mean it seems like truckload pricing is kind of down a little bit. Just wondering what you think currently is kind of causing that additional pressure and maybe whether that some of your larger longer-term customers are trying to lock-in rates ahead of any potential capacity squeezes?","John P. Wiehoff","Specifically, what's happened in the pricing in January, that's the sort of metric that we don't have scrubbed yet until we really close the books. But I would say just anecdotally from interacting with our people, I haven't seen or heard any significant changes in the pricing approach. What I can share, though, is that one of the things we've talked about a lot internally is that it just feels like, in our customer base, there were a lot of examples of customers that did fairly meaningful year-end plant shutdown, and inventory management and slower ramp-ups into the current year. So our hope is that, that, that was big part of what we were seeing, is just diminished year-end activity that carry over into January. Things did change as the month went on, and I don't think feel like there's -- I'm not aware of any material shifts or changes in the bidding activity or pricing activity in our business.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a second question regarding Phoenix, I know it's really early, you're only 2 months into it, and there's a lot of transitions taking place. But so far, could you talk about like the general customer acceptance and whether you've seen already any significant opportunities on the cross-selling side?","John P. Wiehoff","Customer activity, I would say customer reception has been very positive by our judgment, both, Phoenix has a very diverse customer base. So they don't have any large customers that constitute a heavy percentage of their business. But at the same time, we and they are not aware of any significant losses from a customer or people standpoint. Both -- all of the Robinson global forwarding offices continue to sell and there have been some wins. It probably would be unfair to say that there has been any known wins due to the combination or synergies. I think both teams have good momentum and are continuing to sell. Most of the shorter-term wins have been on the realignment of the network with agents or offices or service contracts or the procurement side of it. So we feel very positive about the cultural fit. I think the teams are working together very well. There have been some tangible wins on the cost side that maybe didn't benefit the fourth quarter that much, but we feel pretty good about benefiting 2013. In terms of cross-selling, integrating, sharing account management practices, a lot of that needs to be facilitated by some of the IT integration that's going to take a little bit longer for us to get into. So hopefully as 2013 wears on, we'll feel more confident about our go-to-market benefits from the acquisition. But at least to date, we feel very good about the absence of any disruption.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Let's see. A question on the cost side, I think, John, you just mentioned that you had some wins on the cost side. I was wondering, I guess, in fourth quarter, was there anything on the amortization that was unusual? You didn't mention that. But then, looking at cost side in 2013, can you give any kind of framework for what these cost wins would be that you're talking about, how substantial they might be?","Chad M. Lindbloom","Yes. To start -- this is Chad, to start with the amortization, the only piece that would be unusual in the fourth quarter is that it only had 2 months, because we only owned the company starting November 1. So as far as the cost wins on the synergies, I think there will be some cost of hire as we leverage freight and look at each other, as like John was mentioning, each other's freight rates with different service providers, and leverage each other's contracts with both Air and Ocean business, as well as, we've always talked about, we don't expect any immediate cost synergies in the deal, it's all going to be about integrating and doing the best of both. And from any significant perspective, we will be growing, hopefully be able to, once the significant acquisition integration efforts are done, continue to leverage the overhead rather than really ever looking for significant changes in the overhead structure.","Elizabeth Mielke - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. But you're not talking about a significant headcount reduction or something along those lines, in terms of the cost wins?","Chad M. Lindbloom","No. What we -- what our plan is for the Phoenix integration, is that we believe in the short-term that by carrying all of the people from both organizations, we have the incremental resources to focus on integration and all the changed management stuff that we need to do. And as that occurs and as our system gets more efficient, when it comes time to -- that we could get by more efficiently on fewer resources, our hope is to have grown the business to keep jobs for everybody, so that the long-range plan is that it's a growth strategy and if we're successful, we would hope that for the next 3 to 5 years, we can grow our net revenues much faster than we would grow our operating expenses. But that was a part of what I was trying to share in our 2013 outlook, that I think the history of Global Forwarding mergers and acquisitions is that everybody who has gone after cost synergies too aggressively has disrupted their customer relationships and services to the point where it's helped -- turned out to be a bad deal, and we're taking a very long term approach around the continuity to our relationships and our service and trying to create the synergies and the deal over a little bit longer period of time through a growth platform.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just a short follow-up. I might've missed this, but you said the loads in North American truck, up about 10% in January, best you can tell. Is there any sense of net revenue in North American truck in January? Is it flat or...","Chad M. Lindbloom","I did not say 10% in January, I said the volume growth approximated what it was. Again, we're -- with all of the mix shifts that we've had, it's -- we want to be more comfortable closing the books before we say precisely what it would be. But we did have meaningful margin compression year-over-year in January, as well, that reduced our net revenue growth from the volume similar to the last couple of years.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a question, just trying to make sure I understand. From a fourth quarter perspective, if you were to back out the Phoenix acquisition when you think about that transportation margin, is it fair to use that the 30 to 40 basis points that you highlighted, kind of on a broader basis, historically? Is that about the impact that you think you saw?","John P. Wiehoff","Yes. In that range. I mean, slightly less. Because I think that Forwarding, if I remember, I'm going by memory right now, but I think that Forwarding net revenue margin was a little lower than 20%. And one of the challenges is that the pro forma stuff is annualized and margins can change a lot from quarter-to-quarter, with tapering off at the end of the year. And so it's really going to take a year or so to make sure that we get the seasonality and fluctuations of the buy\/sell margins understood.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So that would, I guess, kind of imply that you had either a flat or maybe a slight deceleration or a decrease in the margin on a sequential basis, just wanted to get, maybe, a little bit of color around how you're thinking about, was that really the impact of December that you talked about, as far as maybe plant and customer shutdowns? Or was there -- or was it just a tighter, tougher market for you in the fourth quarter? Just wanted to get a better understanding of that.","John P. Wiehoff","I think in the margin compression was comparable to the previous quarters. It just wasn't -- started looking better in October and then softened near the end.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up would just be on the Air side. Just want to get a rough sense. We've heard from a few other players that maybe it was a little bit tighter in the air, than maybe what your results would suggest. I think you saw some margin expansion there, just wanted to get a sense of what, kind of, your view on the fourth quarter from an Air perspective was?","John P. Wiehoff","Yes. I think the primary thing, a significant percentage of the airfreight is co-loaded with multiple customers. And we were very small in the Air Services business, and Phoenix too, is larger in the Ocean than in the Air. So that's one of the examples of where, just the combined volumes pretty quickly led to some opportunities for co-loading to make -- to improve things. That's probably the most short-term, specific example of cost synergies that we could give just because in that business, it's so much about consolidation dynamics that if you double the volumes it's almost certain to be a pretty good thing.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Yes, I would add, even excluding folding the 2 companies' freight together, C.H. Robinson's Air volumes, or our density in certain lanes were getting better, which were driving to much better net revenue margins compared to a year ago.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Dahlman Rose.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","If I could go on the net margins there. You mentioned that January had some continued pressure, and I think you said significant. So am I to interpret that as January's net revenue margins are going to be more significantly under pressure than December's were?","Chad M. Lindbloom","No, I think John's comment on under the pressure is compared to last year is January, not sequential comparisons.","John P. Wiehoff","Correct.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","So sequentially, how did they look?","John P. Wiehoff","Yes, they were about the same. I mean, there was an -- 20 or so basis points, sequentially.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Remember, by that time we report the first quarter, December and January are the least significant of the fourth and first quarter. I'm not sure that, especially when you look at the holiday seasons and the time of where the holidays fall within the business week, those cut-offs can be a little deceptive, so I'm not sure how helpful the sequential net revenue margin activity is in our business.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And my follow-up question here, when you look at the LTL growth, it continued to outpace truckload throughout the year, do you expect that to continue in 2013 here?","John P. Wiehoff","We definitely have better momentum in that business. I'm not aware of anything that would change that. So our hope would be that we would continue to see significant growth on that, yes.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So I wanted to take another stab at the question around the margins. If we can try and focus just on the North America, the Truck business, how are gross margins in fourth quarter, year-over-year, compared with third quarter year-over-year? And then in terms of your comment on January, is January, on a year-over-year basis, better or worse than what fourth quarter was? Just trying to get a sense if the year-over-year compression is getting less worse or if it's getting worse, when we think about the core Truck business in North America.","John P. Wiehoff","I guess we never release our truckload net revenue margins and we're not going to start to now. So if you go over the total transportation net revenue margins, which obviously Truck is the biggest driver of it, you can see that 2011's third quarter was 16.4%; 2012 was 15.6%. In quarter 4, it was 16.3%, for 2011, and 15.8%. So maybe that 15.8% is the equivalent of 15.5% or 15.6%, if you back out the estimated impacts of Phoenix. Besides that, that's about as far as we'll go.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","And do you have any thoughts on January, if it's getting less worse?","John P. Wiehoff","I think the primary thought that we discussed in our internal review was what I already shared, was that December ended very softly and January began very softly. I think month-over-month, it feels fairly consistent. But it's really difficult to tell 1 month into the quarter, particularly with December and January, that are the lesser of the months.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","And maybe just with that, do you think that the January compression, is that another step down in yields? Or is that more a continuation of what you saw in 2012? Meaning, if I remember correctly, that January '12, actually, was off to a decent start from a yield perspective, and the yields got -- the margins got worse throughout the year. So is this just, that we haven't grandfathered or lapped the comp? Or is it taking another step down, I guess? Just trying to understand.","John P. Wiehoff","So as I said earlier, it's a common seasonal pattern for us that margins expand during January as the month goes on, and then contracts as the spring activity starts to pick up. So it is the case that January margins started out good last year, relative, which would always be the case. So I think our overall message sort of stands, that there's nothing really unique or different that we're aware of about January versus the fourth quarter. But unfortunately, there continues to be year-over-year net revenue margin compression in our truckload services.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And then just last thing, if I can. You've talked about last year, getting to a mid to upper 40s net operating margin. With Phoenix and being a lower margin business, is that still the goal, or is that tougher to get to now?","John P. Wiehoff","I would say as freight forwarding in general as Phoenix or otherwise, if that continues to become a bigger percentage of the business, it would be more difficult to get there. I -- there's no -- I mean, the highest net operating income to net revenue ratios as I've seen for a quarter are 31%, 32%. Our Forwarding business was nowhere close to that. But Phoenix's was. They were already at 30% for the historic information that we presented. So will it -- will it make it harder, if it becomes a bigger percentage of the total business? Yes, it would make it harder to get operating income to net revenue on a consolidated basis to 45%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So how much of the compression that you've seen in gross margin over the past several quarters is just a function of the TL industry and the fact that it's been balanced, et cetera, as you mentioned, versus how much do you think is a function of your efforts to gain share and maybe some price concessions you've had to make to do that?","John P. Wiehoff","Well, I think that's one of the core questions that we and all of you have been struggling with for the last couple of years. I feel like our -- the outcome of net revenue margin compression over the last couple of years, one of the reasons why I highlighted the 10-year trend is that, if you go back 4 years to late 2008, early 2009 and you see our all-time highs and the 10-year highs on that net revenue margin, we were saying then, and it was not at all surprising to us, that those margins would cycle back to more longer-term averages. Now the fact that they've cycled down for all of 3 years and have cycled to lows and all the questions around secular impacts versus cyclical, and kind of sorting out how much of it's the balanced market, how much of it is competition, how much of it is mix shift, how much of it is change in shipper's attitude, those are all real factors that we've acknowledged before, that I think they all play into the mix in one variety or another. And I guess, part of the prepared comments was really saying, because you can't sort them out, we have to make the choice of how we want to respond to the environment in aggregate, and our choice is clearly that in this balanced market, we want to stay near the top of that route guide, we want to have committed relationships to our customers and go after that market share. So again, it's just impossible to isolate the impact from any one of those variables. It's a combination of all those market factors.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in -- at the end of your closing comments, John, about productivity being a critical factor. How do you measure that? And what are the benchmarks, kind of targets that you're looking at? And we can't really use the historical metrics for Robinson now, with the acquisition that those numbers get kind of thrown off. So what should we look at to gauge your performance in terms of productivity?","John P. Wiehoff","Good question, and that's why we added the pro forma slides around the comparisons. We have pages of productivity metrics but the most visible and simplest one is operating income as a percentage of net revenue. We look at that by branch, by customer, whatever we can, to understand our profitability. So one of the things that we feel strong about in our business model is that we have lower net revenue margin freight that we think is some of the best freight that we have. If it's highly automated, repetitive, dedicated freight that we can be very efficient with, the ultimate measurement of the freight, or evaluation of the freight desirability and our productivity gets down to the profitability per shipment or that operating income per branch, per customer, per person,  however we look at it. So if, in fact, the combination of market forces, balanced market, competitive factors, evolution of technology, does have a cumulative compression impact on our net revenue margins, that puts pressure on all of us to use technology and use process improvement to be more productive, and make sure that we're generating -- hopefully generating the same kind of operating income or operating margins per shipment that we go after. So in my prepared comments, that's precisely the point I was trying to emphasize is that, while we can't isolate the variables, our management strategy and response to the cumulative effect of all of them has been consistent, and I don't see us changing that.","Chad M. Lindbloom","Yes, I would just add, as the mix of business continues to shift from here, if it does continue to shift with the benchmark of the somewhere around, just in round numbers, low 40% operating income to net revenue for C.H. Robinson, non-straightforward international forwarding, and hopeful of benchmarks to maintain and grow some of our freight forwarding operating income as a percent of net revenue up closer to the Phoenix benchmark of 30%, as those 2, if you look at those 2 separately -- and again, it's impossible to measure it precisely, but if you looked at those 2 separately, that shift of mix will continue to have an impact on those ratios, as we pointed out. And all the other ones, too, like net revenue per person, net personnel expense per person, all those different things will be shifting because of the change in business.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","To what extent can you quantify the magnitude of growth from the share gains versus the organic growth? And then, if you might be able to just to highlight which areas within Truck, I mean, is it LTL or TL, where you might be gaining more share?","John P. Wiehoff","We gave the truckload volume separate to be 10% for the full year; 12% for the quarter; about 8% for North America because of the comparable volume growth, because of the Apreo acquisition, with all that short haul freight; and then we gave a volume growth for LTL, as well, of 16%. So there are various industry benchmarks on shipment growth, but our best estimate would be low single-digit growth in terms of GDP type growth in the shipment activity. So if we have double-digit volume activity, that's what would lead us to believe that we did gain market share in both of those services, probably more effectively in LTL as I think that our value proposition and market conditions are a little bit more stable there today. So a lot of the changes that we've been discussing about the balanced market and those are kind of specific more to the truckload dynamics.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And if I could just add onto that, where do you think your market share is today? And then, where would you like it to be and, basically, at what point you feel like that is the number where you're comfortable with, that you have relative market positioning?","John P. Wiehoff","Market share on Truckload is a tough calculation. I think there's kind of 2 primary ways to look at it. One would be the percentage of the total truckload universe, which we believe by that calculation, we have a very small percentage, probably somewhere around 3% of the total North American truckload market. Another way to look at it is, of the percentage of the truckload market that runs through some sort of 3PL or broker, again, analyst estimates would be that, that's maybe 15% to 20% of the total market. And then our share of that market would be something more approaching the 8% or 10%, or even a little -- as high as 15%, maybe, Chad is saying. So when we think about market share gains, those are both important calculations because, one, we believe that the third party industry is taking share within the total truckload sector, and that, that is an important secular trend that we've been benefiting from for the last couple of decades. And we believe there are a lot of good reasons why that hopefully will continue. We also believe that by being the largest, and in many ways, we hope the most capable, that we've been able to take share within that third-party market, as well, too. So when we think about taking share, it's both about outperforming our direct competitors, as well as us all collectively, hopefully continuing to be a better service and value and price proposition for the shippers, so that we collectively can penetrate the truckload market.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I appreciate all that. I'm just trying to get a gauge as to at what point does the company believe it would have reached that point where it's quite comfortable? And I guess, obviously a lot of these numbers are quite tricky, and I can appreciate the challenges of trying to get to a proper or an exact, precise market share number. But I mean, if it's not necessarily a percentage, is it a time frame that we should be looking at?","John P. Wiehoff","Well, I think, today, if you look at -- I think our decision, if you're challenging, saying when would we change our thought process about taking market share, I would say that today, while our margins are compressing, we still very feel very comfortable about the profitability of our entire portfolio. And so as long as we feel that we can grow our business and grow our profitability, and the incremental freight is profitable in creating value, we'd continue to do what we're doing. We do know that we have more competitors that are focused on taking market share, and probably less concerned about profitability than we are. And if we sensed that the market was stagnating and that competitive factors were such that many people were buying market share or going after freight that they could not be profitable at, at some point, we would back off in terms of our growth aspirations if we were not able to be profitable on the incremental growth that we're going after. But today, we feel very comfortable with that. It may not be as profitable as it was the year before, but we still feel like it's adding a lot of value.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of William Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","John, one of the things you've said in the past is that over long periods of time, you've tended toward a top and bottom line growth rate of around 15%, and you didn't sort of reiterate that comment in some of your outlook here, and I'm just curious if that was change that you intended to convey, or am I reading way too much into sort of a lack of comment?","John P. Wiehoff","I guess the way I feel about that topic is, when we've referenced it in the past, we've always referenced it from deregulation in 1980 up until the current, that we're talking about it in terms of decades. I don't believe we've ever felt that during periods of recession, or more difficult economic growth, we've always acknowledged those growth rates are going to fluctuate and be much more difficult to achieve. I'm not sure if we're in a decade of slower growth, where that's going to be the more extended period of time, where it's going to be difficult or impossible to achieve that growth rate. But I do know that most people interact with us, don't really care about the next 10 years, they only care about a shorter horizon than that. So it doesn't feel relevant to talk about it right now. But we haven't given up on the fact that over decades and long periods of time, we still think there's tremendous opportunity to take share and grow our business.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","No, yes, of course, you're right. The folks on this call probably care a little bit shorter time than 10 years, but -- the second question is just on, you know about all of this, I'm sure you read about it in the press, this whole near-sourcing of manufacturing and whatnot in the U.S. You guys have gone and made a freight forwarding acquisition, which presumably will tap into some of the global freight flows. But can you talk a little bit about your capabilities to benefit from any near sourcing? Or is that something that you don't really have enough presence in Mexico, or maybe Phoenix got that for you or whatnot? Maybe just talk a little bit about how that could play out?","John P. Wiehoff","I think that's a good question. When we talk about mix shift, for a long time, we were talking about extended supply chains and extended lengths of haul, particularly within Truckload, probably from some of the intermodal competitive factors, as well as changes in shipper supply chain strategies. That we do think there has been some shortening of the supply chain over the last couple of years. Now whether that will continue or not remains to be seen. We have been very successful in Mexico the past couple of decades when we talk about North American transportation, that includes a meaningful business in Mexico that we feel we have great competencies with. So the significant increases in manufacturers who are moving to Mexico, that's something we feel we have and can continue to benefit from them. I think the increase in LTL is probably also something that with those shorter supply chains, comes more frequent smaller shipments, generally, as well, too. So the fact that we're integrating our services, focusing more on things like network analysis, management services, technology, greater concentration of LTL shipments, all of those are ways that we can interact with a shipper to evolve to a new environment where they're going to need a different mix of services. But we feel well-positioned to continue to evolve with them. When you take away some of that traditional long haul truckload freight, that doesn't help the margins in our traditional North American Truckload business. But it's probably, that whole story, is maybe a good example of why we still feel good about our long-term value proposition, even though the market forces maybe contributing to some truckload net revenue compression.","Tim Gagnon","Unfortunately, we're out of time, so that will have to be our last question.

Following today's presentation, Bob Houghton will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, October 31, year 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Bob Houghton, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Andy Clarke, Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Biesterfeld, Chief Operating Officer and President of North American Surface Transportation. John, Andy, and Bob will provide commentary on our 2018 third quarter results. Presentation slides that accompany their remarks can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com. We will follow that with responses to the pre-submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday.","I'd like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.","And with that, I will turn the call over to John.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. In my opening remarks, I want to highlight some of the themes we'll be discussing with you today.","First, we are pleased with our financial results this quarter. Truckload volume trends improved sequentially, and we delivered volume growth in many of our service lines. We generated another quarter of double-digit increases in both net revenue and operating income and a 270 basis point increase in operating income margin. This strong operating profit performance, combined with improved working capital performance and the benefits of U.S. tax reform, enabled us to generate significant increases in cash flow from operations and cash returns to shareholders in the quarter. Andy and Bob will provide additional context on our financial performance in their prepared remarks.","We experienced double-digit cost and price increases across most of our service lines. In our North American truckload business, the rate of increase in cost and price did moderate a bit in the quarter, however, pricing still increased 14% versus last year. Our higher prices reflect a combination of spot market activity above year-ago levels and pricing reflective of market conditions across the majority of our business portfolio.","Truckload price increases modestly outpaced carrier cost increases, leading to a 50 basis point increase in total company net revenue margin in the quarter. In periods of market dislocation, we experience higher levels of repricing activity across our portfolio. As freight costs decelerate, we typically see our volumes shift more heavily towards contractual business accompanied by net revenue growth and margin expansion. This outcome is reflected in our third quarter results and highlights the strength of our business model.","Our business model allows us to effectively serve customers with committed annual pricing arrangements as well as those who prefer more fluid spot market pricing. We continue to believe managing this mix of pricing commitments is the best way to both serve our customers and grow our business.","With those introductory comments I'll turn it over to Andy to review our financial statements.","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we've achieved record levels of net revenue and operating income and drove significant expansion in operating income margin. In our North American Surface Transportation business, we delivered double-digit net revenue growth and a 380 basis point improvement in operating margin. Additionally, our Robinson Fresh team generated impressive growth in operating income and operating margin, despite a challenging fresh produce environment. Our great results in this quarter reflect our ongoing efforts to profitably expand our business through a focus on growth, while maintaining strong operational excellence.","Now onto slide 4 and our financial results; third quarter total revenues increased 13.4% to $4.3 billion. These increases were driven by higher pricing across all transportation service lines, volume growth in LTL and Global Forwarding, and higher fuel cost. Total company net revenues increased over $100 million or 16.9% in the quarter to $694 million. Net revenue growth was led by truckload services up $78 million and LTL services up $21 million. We continue to see the benefits of our investments in air and customs service lives where combined net revenues increased over $10 million in the quarter.","Total operating expenses increased $49 million, a 12.2% increase versus the prior-year period. Personnel expenses increased 14.4% primarily as a result of increases in variable compensation that reflect our improved financial performance. We believe performance-based pay is the best way to align the interest of our employees with our shareholders.","Total company average head count increased 2.6% in the quarter, led by increases to support growth opportunities in Global Forwarding, which was partially offset by declining head count in Robinson Fresh. Sequentially, our head count decreased by approximately 1% from the second quarter of this year. SG&A expenses were up 6.2% in the quarter to $113 million, primarily driven by increases in purchased services and occupancy cost. These were partially offset by a decrease in equipment rental and maintenance and insurance expenses.","Total operating income was $246 million in the third quarter, up 26.5% over last year. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues was 35.4%, up 270 basis points versus last year's third quarter and 280 basis points sequentially. Our teams did an excellent job of achieving operating margin leverage in the quarter, and this remains a top priority in the fourth quarter and into 2019. Third quarter net income was $176 million, an increase of 47.6%. These results include a $16.9 million benefit from the U.S. Tax Reform Act passed in December of 2017. Our diluted earnings per share was $1.25 in the third quarter, up from $0.85 last year.","Slide 5 covers other incomes impacting net income. The third quarter effective tax rate was 26.5%, down from 35.2% last year. The lower tax rate was driven primarily by the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate. Our year-to-date tax rate was 24.7% and we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 24% and 25% for the full year.","As previously noted, we adopted the new Accounting Standards Update for revenue recognition in the first quarter of this year. As a result, in-transit shipments are now included in our financial results. We do not expect this policy to have a material impact on our overall operating results for the year. However, it does significantly decrease gross revenues in our Robinson Fresh sourcing business, including a $29 million reduction in the third quarter of this year.","Third quarter interest and other expense totaled $6.5 million, down from $10.5 million last year. Every quarter we are required to revalue our U.S. dollar working capital and cash balances against the functional currency in each country where we conduct business and hold U.S. dollars. The resulting gain or loss is reflected on the income statement.","The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen this quarter as it has all year against several of our key currencies, most notably the Chinese RMB resulting in a $7 million gain from currency revaluation. Movements in currency valuations will have an impact on our quarterly net income and we will continue to break out the impact of our foreign currency revaluation in future quarters. The gain in currency valuation was partially offset by higher interest expense due to increased debt levels and higher variable interest rates. Our share count in the quarter was down nearly 1% as share repurchases were partially offset by the impact of activity in our equity compensation plans.","Turning to slide 6, we had a very strong quarter for cash generation. Cash flow from operations totaled over $220 million in the third quarter, up 223% versus last year. For the nine months of this year, cash flow from operations increased 142% to $529 million. A combination of improved working capital performance and increased earnings drove the third quarter and year-to-date cash flow improvement. Capital expenditures totaled $19.5 million for the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures of $60 million to $70 million with the majority dedicated to technology.","Our capital distribution is summarized on slide 7. We returned $151 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends in the quarter, a 19% increase versus the year-ago period. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $422 million to shareholders, a 24% increase. Moving forward, we will continue to evaluate and deploy our capital in ways that add value to our network of customers and carriers and generate returns for our employees and shareholders. Additionally, we will acquire companies that fit our strategy, business model and culture, and we will reward our shareholders through buyback and dividends.","Now onto the balance sheet on slide 8; working capital increased 12.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by higher gross revenues and the resulting increase in accounts receivables. The contract assets and accrued transportation expense line items on the balance sheet primarily reflect in-transit activity in accordance with the adoption of the revenue recognition policy. The increase in accounts payable reflect higher purchased transportation costs.","Our debt balance at quarter-end was approximately $1.3 billion. Across our credit facility, private placement debt, AR securitization and senior notes, our weighted average interest rate was 4% in the quarter. On October 25, we completed an increase in our revolving credit facility from $900 million to $1 billion and extended the maturity date to October of 2023. The amend and extend of our credit facility as part of our normal course of business to optimize our capital structure and provides us with additional flexibility to invest in our business, to fund acquisitions and return cash to shareholders.","I will wrap up my comments this morning with a look at our current trends. Our consistent practice is to share the per business day comparison of net revenues and volume. This October has one additional business day versus the prior year, translating to one additional business day for the fourth quarter. October 2018 global net revenues per business day have increased approximately 9%. October North America truckload volume has decreased approximately 2%.","As we look ahead to the balance of the fourth quarter, we wanted to highlight a couple of items from our 2017 fourth quarter results. Driven by the impact of the two hurricanes in 2017, we saw sequential acceleration of our net revenues from 6.3% in the third quarter to 12.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our 2017 net revenue per business day increased 10% in October, 13% in November, and 14% in December. We also had two non-recurring tax items which lowered our 2017 fourth quarter provision for income tax by $31.8 million.","We appreciate you all listening this morning and I'll now turn over to Bob to provide additional context on our segment performance.","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Andy. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to have the opportunity to speak with all of you today and to provide an update on our operating segment performance. I'd like to begin my remarks by highlighting the cyclical and ever-changing nature of the logistics market.","On slide 10, the light- and dark-blue lines represent the percent change in North America truckload rate per mile charged to our customers and cost per mile paid to our contract carriers, net of fuel costs since 2008. The gray line represents our net revenue margin for all transportation services. While the rate of growth in North America truckload price per mile and cost per mile declined sequentially during the quarter, both rates and cost increased at a double-digit pace this quarter versus the third quarter of last year. You can also see within the graph that despite the high level of volatility in the freight market, we are able to maintain our margins over time and generate margin improvement when costs moderate. Our third quarter transportation net revenue margin of 16.6% increased 40 basis points sequentially from the second quarter of 2018.","One of the metrics we use to measure market conditions is the truckload routing guide depth from our Managed Services business. In the third quarter, average routing guide depth of tender was 1.7, representing that on average the second carrier in a shipper's routing guide was executing the shipment. And while routing guide depth did moderate sequentially versus the second quarter, we remain above the average truckload routing guide depth experienced in a balanced market. Costs remained above year-ago levels, up 12% in the third quarter, excluding the impact of fuel. In our contractual business, we have pricing in place reflective of the current environment, and at the same time we continue to help our customers secure capacity within the spot market.","Turning to slide 11, this graph shows North American truckload average price per mile received from our customers and cost per mile paid to our carriers since 2010 and represents the underlying data from the previous slide. We've excluded the actual price per mile and cost per mile scale on this slide to protect our proprietary data. While the year-over-year change in price and cost moderated versus last quarter, the absolute price per mile and cost per mile remain above year-ago levels. The chart on the slide also shows that since 2010 we've continued to adjust our pricing in response to changes in marketplace conditions. We've generally maintained a consistent spread between price and cost even in high inflation periods. Despite significant levels of volatility in the freight market, both customer and carrier costs have increased at roughly 3% annually over this time period.","Turning to slide 12 and our North America Surface Transportation (sic) [North American Surface Transportation] (00:16:25) business. The increase in NAST net revenues accelerated in the third quarter, up 23.3% to $466 million in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in our truckload, less-than-truckload, and intermodal services. A combination of higher contractual prices and a sequential decline in freight costs in the third quarter drove a 60 basis point expansion in net revenue margin, despite a 50 basis point headwind from higher fuel costs.","Led by higher pricing across our portfolio, our truckload net revenues increased 25.5% to $335 million for the quarter. Truckload volume trends continued to improve sequentially, declining just 0.5% in the third quarter. The successful repricing of our contractual portfolio over the last couple of quarters resulted in an approximate mix of 60% contractual and 40% transactional volume for the quarter versus a 55% contractual and 45% transactional mix last quarter. Additionally, we further closed our volume gap versus industry benchmarks in the third quarter. Over the longer term, our goal remains balanced growth and market share gains within our NAST truckload business.","Our sequential volume improvement is aided by the continued addition of new carriers to our network. The implementation of electronic logging devices has not slowed our rate of new carrier adoption. In fact, we added roughly 5,000 new carriers in the third quarter, a 40% increase over last year's third quarter and a 14% sequential improvement versus last quarter. These carriers moved over 20,000 loads for us in the quarter. This is the largest number of new carriers that we've added in any single quarter in our history. Carriers continue to choose C.H. Robinson as the 3PL of choice for securing freight and optimizing their networks, while the addition of thousands of motor carriers every quarter allows us to bring new capacity solutions to life for our customers.","Our less-than-truckload business delivered another quarter with strong performance, with net revenues increasing 19.6% to $117 million. We delivered a double-digit increase in pricing, driven by continued tight capacity in the LTL segment and the expansion of our pricing tools that enable us to react faster to changes in the market. LTL volumes increased 4.5% in the quarter, driven by growth in manufacturing and ecommerce. We continue to gain meaningful scale in the LTL segment of the market, both within our common carrier model as well as within our consolidation of product.","This quarter represents the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit net revenue growth. Today, we're significantly larger than our nearest LTL broker competitors in terms of both revenue and volume, and we'd rank as a top 10 domestic LTL carrier, despite the fact that we don't own a single truck. And at 17% of overall company net revenues with net revenue margins above the company average, our NAST LTL business is an increasingly important part of our service line portfolio at C.H. Robinson. In our intermodal service line, net revenues increased 10.8% in the quarter, as a 6% decline in volume was more than offset by higher pricing and improved customer mix.","Slide 13 outlines our NAST operating income performance. Third quarter operating income increased 34.9% to $204 million. Operating margin improved 380 basis points to 43.9% and improved 160 basis points sequentially. This strong performance includes the impact of higher variable compensation expense. As Andy mentioned, we believe performance-based pay is the best way to align employee and shareholder interest and this increase in variable performance-based pay is reflected in our strong NAST operating profit results in the quarter.","Our performance reflects continued progress against the efficiency and productivity initiatives in our NAST business, as we continue to transform our network and evolve our go-to-market strategies. Investments in technology are improving our ability to effectively match the demand of shippers and the supply of carriers via advanced algorithms, further automating transactions across our network between customers and carriers.","We were able to deliver another quarter of double-digit gains in net revenues, sequential improved truckload volume, and increased LTL volumes against flat head count. We expect NAST head count to be flat to down modestly for the full year. Our digital transformation efforts are accelerating, and we'll continue to invest in technology that improves the efficiency of our processes, impacts the productivity of our employees, and benefits our customers.","Turning to slide 14 and our Global Forwarding business; Global Forwarding net revenues increased 3.3% to $134 million in the quarter. Our acquisition of Milgram & Company in Canada contributed approximately 3 percentage points to the growth in the quarter. As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of Milgram on August 31 of last year. So, the third quarter of 2017 did include one month of Milgram results. For the quarter, ocean net revenues decreased 7.9% versus the year-ago period, where we demonstrated strong growth and net revenues increased 44%.","Across the ocean segment, ecommerce growth and the potential of expanded tariffs drove increased shipment volumes as customers built increasing levels of inventory. The resulting tightness in capacity drove a greater-than-expected increase in ocean freight costs leading to the net revenue decline on a per shipment basis in the quarter. The year-ago comparison also included a non-recurring ocean freight project. This was partially offset by Milgram contributing approximately 2 percentage points of net revenue growth to the ocean service line.","Our ocean shipments increased 7% in the quarter through a combination of existing customer growth and new business wins. Through a combination of pricing adjustments to reflect current market conditions and a strong sales pipeline, we expect to return to ocean net revenue growth in the fourth quarter.","Third quarter air net revenues increased 17.7%, with Milgram contributing approximately 1 percentage point to that growth. Air shipments increased approximately 7% in the quarter as we continued to benefit from the investments we've made to grow volume and density in our air gateway cities.","Customs net revenues increased 33.8% in the quarter, with Milgram contributing 12 percentage points to that growth. Customs transactions increased approximately 20% in the third quarter, as we continue to execute our strategy of broadening our service portfolio and expanding our customs presence across the globe.","Slide 15 outlines our Global Forwarding operating income performance. Third quarter operating income decreased 23.4% to $23.8 million. Operating margin declined 620 basis points year-over-year to 17.8%. Operating expenses increased 12% in the quarter, driven primarily by a 9% increase in head count and higher variable compensation expense. Milgram accounted for approximately 5 percentage points of the head count growth. Headcount has declined 1% on a sequential basis and is now down sequentially from the beginning of the year.","Looking forward, we'll continue to be focused on the significant top line growth opportunities in front of us, but we'll also be focused on operating margin expansion through additional technology deployment and process automation. Over the long term, we remain confident that we will deliver operating margin performance consistent with other leading companies in the Global Forwarding segment of the market.","Transitioning to slide 16 and our Robinson Fresh segment, sourcing net revenues were $25 million, down 15.4% from last year. Case volumes declined 9.5%, driven by a combination of a strategic customer exiting the fresh produce business, lower levels of customer promotional activity at retail, and lower restaurant traffic within our food service customers.","The hard enforcement of the ELD mandate has had a greater impact on the temperature controlled and multi-stop loads that are common in the fresh produce business. This has led to higher purchased transportation costs that also contributed to the net revenue decline within our product business. The revenue recognition policy change negatively impacted sourcing total revenues by approximately $29 million, but there was no impact to net revenues.","Robinson Fresh transportation net revenues grew 43.6% to $35 million, led by strong double-digit increases in both truckload and LTL service lines. The improvements in Robinson Fresh transportation results are directly related to the repricing activities that took place in the first half of 2018. As we've discussed in the past, the Robinson Fresh transportation business tends to have a larger percent of their customer portfolio concentrated in contractual business when compared to our NAST truckload business.","Slide 17 outlines our Robinson Fresh operating income performance. Third quarter operating income grew 84.8% to $21.4 million. Operating margin improved by over 1,400 basis points to 35.5%, aided by higher net revenues in the transport business. At the same time, a combination of stringent operating expense controls, investments in technology to improve our operational efficiency, and exiting certain facilities within our network drove an approximate 6% reduction in head count and a 9% reduction in total operating expenses.","Moving to our All Other and Corporate businesses on slide 18; as a reminder, All Other includes our Managed Services business, Surface Transportation outside of North America, other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses. Managed Services net revenue increased 8.6% to $20.1 million in the quarter, driven by a combination of selling additional services to existing customers, new customer wins, and growth in our existing services. Our sales pipeline in the Managed Services business is stronger than ever.","Freight under management increased 2% in the quarter to over $900 million, and we're on track to hit our goal of nearly $4 billion in freight under management for the full year of 2018. Customers continue to value Navisphere, our proprietary transportation management system, which allows them to control their carrier selection process and manage their complex supply chains without a fixed investment in technology or human capital. Other Surface Transportation net revenues increased 1% in the quarter to $14 million. We've got a strong pipeline of new business in our Europe Surface Transportation, and we expect volume trends to improve in the fourth quarter.","Before I turn the call back to John for some final comments, I'll take a minute to wrap up this section on our business unit performance. We delivered another quarter of strong business results, with improving volume trends, double-digit growth in net revenues, and accelerating expansion of both net revenue margins and operating margin. We tripled our cash from operations and significantly increased our returns to shareholders. I'm pleased with our third quarter financial performance. I'm also excited by the opportunities that lie ahead of us.","We'll continue to make investments in our people, our processes and our technology to improve the efficiency of our operations and expand our comprehensive offering of logistics services and capabilities to our customers and our carriers. We'll stay focused on driving innovation via investments in emerging technology and advanced analytics to continue to transform how we add value to our global ecosystem of over 200,000 customers, carriers, and vendors. I remain confident that we'll continue to deliver industry-leading capabilities to our customers and carriers and strong returns to our shareholders.","Thank you for listening this morning, and at this point I'll turn the call back to John.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. Before we move on to the pre-submitted questions, I'll wrap up our prepared remarks with a few final comments. We understand there are a lot of questions and analysis around where we are in the transportation cycle, so we wanted to summarize some of the key metrics that we've shared to assess that question.","First, as we covered in our pricing chart, while we did see a deceleration in the rate of growth in cost per mile and price per mile, absolute cost and price remain meaningfully above year-ago levels. Second, we discussed the shift in our truckload business mix towards more committed volume. Third, routing guide depth moderated slightly versus last quarter, so routing guides are functioning more efficiently at levels of higher demand and higher prices. Fourth, our U.S. GDP did increase 3.5% in the third quarter, reflecting a continued increase in overall business activity. And lastly, in our business review, shippers are generally planning for continued growth of freight volumes in 2019.","Markets can change quickly, but that's a quick recap of some of the key metrics around what we are seeing in the current market conditions. Regardless of the freight environment, we focus on building long-term committed relationships with shippers around the world and fulfilling spot market opportunities when they become available. We provide an expanding set of insights and capabilities that increase the value of the supply chain expertise we deliver to our customers and carriers, and we focus on operating cost efficiency, driving higher levels of productivity and increasing returns to our shareholders. The strength of this business model is reflected in our third quarter financial performance.","Tariff activity is escalating. In our conversations with carriers and global shippers, companies are increasingly planning for the ramifications of tariffs activity and demand implications in the redesign of global supply chains. We are actively engaged in conversations with our customers to help them understand and quantify the impacts of both enacted and potential future tariffs. The current set of tariffs in place has not had a material impact on our financial results, and given our broad portfolio of service line offerings and strong presence in key markets like Southeast Asia and India, we believe we are well positioned to help our customers win in an ever-changing global trade environment.","Lastly, I want to personally thank the over 15,000 C.H. Robinson employees around the world for their outstanding efforts and execution this quarter. In a fast-changing freight environment, we delivered double-digit growth in net revenues, operating profit, and earnings per share, and accelerating expansion in operating margin. We returned $151 million to shareholders in the quarter and delivered a significant improvement in our operating cash flow.","At the same time, we continued to invest in the digital transformation that enables us to deliver increased value to our customers, carriers, employees, and shareholders. We delivered another quarter of strong operating results, and I'm confident we have the right people, processes, and technology to continue to win in the marketplace in the future.","That concludes our prepared comments and, with that, I will turn it back to the operator so we can answer the pre-submitted questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Houghton, the floor is now yours for the question-and-answer session.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Donna. First, I would like to thank the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions after our earnings release yesterday. For today's Q&A session, I will frame up the question and then turn it over to John, Andy, or Bob for a response. And the first question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company and Tom Wadewitz with UBS also asked similar questions. Andy, can you break down the 9% net revenue growth in October between NAST, Global Forwarding, and Fresh?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah. I think given the variability that we saw by segments in both the third quarter and thus far in October, we thought it would be helpful to break out October-to-date performance by each of those reportable segments. So, NAST is up approximately 12% per business day thus far in October, Global Forwarding is up approximately 2% thus far, and Robinson Fresh is up approximately 12% as well, and that would be categorized as continued strength, as Bob mentioned, in the transportation business, which has offset that continued softness in our sourcing business.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. The next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley also asked a similar question. John, can you provide your updated view on the overall freight environment? Are you seeing any signs of slowing economic activity in 2018? And given your market share, would be curious to get your thoughts on the market into 2019.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","In the wrap-up of the prepared comments, we hit on a few of the metrics that kind of summarized the view that we do see demand remaining fairly strong. In that supply and demand relationship, demand is the more volatile part of the equation. So, when we're thinking about how the market may move and what's going to happen in the fourth quarter or next year around that supply and demand relationship, demand does become the harder part to predict.","There's less conversation about it already, but when you look back on 2018 and think about the supply and demand relationship, that hours of service impact in the beginning of the year did end up changing a lot of the routing and a lot of the pricing across the capacity that really did add some added strain into that supply and demand relationship. So, again, demand is the more volatile part of the equation, supply is adjusting. 2018 was probably impacted more significantly just because of all the changes in the supply side around hours of service, but from all the metrics that we see with route guides and overall economic growth and the anecdotal customer reviews that we're a part of, we do see a continued strong demand at this point.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. The next question is for Bob and is also from Jack Atkins of Stephens. Brandon Oglenski with Barclays and Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer asked similar questions. C.H. Robinson has done a great job in improving productivity in the NAST segment over the last 12 months. Are there more levers to pull to extract more leverage in the model? And as a follow-up, as volume growth re-accelerates, will you need to increase head count, or will further productivity gains help?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So, at our Investor Day last year I talked about how NAST was really in the early stages of our journey to improving productivity and into the digital transformation of our business. Since that time, we've continued to introduce and institutionalize more digital processes that have really helped to drive efficiency for our customers, for our carriers, and for our employees. And also, since that time we've introduced digital freight matching and the ability for our carriers to now self-book loads in a frictionless environment, both online and through our mobile application.","We've more than doubled the automated truckload events that flow through our system, and we really continue to extend that electronic ecosystem to shippers, carriers, and suppliers within the supply chain. We've also then focused internally in terms of digitalizing our processes there and taking unnecessary steps out of the work that our people do. So, I've talked about the digitalization of our customer journeys in the past, we're making headway there. In short, we think there is a lot more leverage in our NAST model and we anticipate head count remaining flattish, while we continue to pursue market share gains across all of our services.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. The next question is for John. Several analysts asked what are your expectations for contract pricing in 2019. Lapping the strong increases from this year, do you see a scenario where contract rates are up mid-single digits again next year, or does that seem too optimistic?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Our best sense of the contract pricing at this time is kind of what we'd characterize the range as low to mid-single digits, so maybe the mid-single digits question would be the high end of the range of what we're seeing. I would remind you again, maybe very obvious, but it's an incredibly fragmented market. We don't have an overall company tariff or pricing target. For us, whatever contracted price average we achieve, it's the blend of tens of thousands of lanes and a lot of mixture that comes together.","We've said throughout the year and still believe that a lot of the price increase and dislocation from this year was somewhat of a makeup from a couple of years of price declines that you see on the chart that is in our deck that Bob talked you through. So, that coupled with some of the dislocation and efficiency around hours of service, we believe that a lot of the extraordinary price increases this year were more a function of some of those factors. As demand continues to remain strong as I've mentioned in the previous question and supply continues to adjust, we do feel that low- to mid-single-digit increases in committed pricing for 2019 is a reasonable estimate at this point.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. The next question for Andy is from Chris Wetherbee of Citi and Matt Russell of Goldman Sachs. What drove the accelerated operating leverage in the third quarter from an operating margin standpoint and is that sustainable in the fourth quarter?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","We've talked at length on these calls and in our investor presentations about how, as a company, we make investments in our people and our process and our technology throughout all the different economic cycles. So, when you think back to 2015 when margins were expanding, we were making investments in all of those areas and we had leverage in the model. We hit a bit of a challenging economic cycle in the end of 2016 and the beginning 2017, and we continue to make those investments. And clearly, we were confident that those investments would show both positive results as well as leverage.","It did have a bit of a challenge, though, on our results, and as we came into the latter part of 2017 and then all of 2018, we've been very consistent about those investments and yet, here we are today with a 270 basis point improvement on a year-over-year basis, 110 of that came from personnel, despite the fact that we have more people today which is great and 160 basis point improvement in our SG&A. And, again, I think that just speaks to the power of the work that our people are doing out there every day and the leverage that they bring to the organization. As far as what our expectations are, I would say given the backdrop what we see out there today, we expect for continued leverage in our results as we go into the latter part of the year.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. The next question for Bob comes from Matt Young with Morningstar. Is the acceleration in year-over-year NAST gross margin expansion more a function of contract pricing gains or an incremental softening in spot rates?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","As John said, in the back half of last year we really saw unprecedented increases in the cost of capacity that was tied to a number of factors, including the pending implementation of ELDs as well as the disruption caused by the weather events. Those events, coupled with continued tight capacity into 2018, really moved the market up and drove the need to increase customer pricing to ensure that freight continued to move in the marketplace.","We continue to reprice contractual bids throughout each quarter of the year, and so we're reading where we see those markets and making our forward-looking commitments to our customers. So, I think that drives some of the sequential improvement in pricing year-over-year, in pricing and gross margin. Specific to pricing and where we're at today, we believe that we're really well positioned in our contractual portfolio for where we are at in the cycle and we continue to manage the spot market business to meet the needs of both customers and carriers.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. The next question is for Andy. Todd Fowler with KeyBanc asked, comment on the strength in cash from operations during the quarter. Is there more opportunity to improve working capital?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah. We're really pleased with the cash flow generation year-to-date at Robinson, and if you look at that one line, the cash flow from operations, it's up over $300 million. The biggest of the factors that impacted that, the biggest one was obviously net income which was up $120 million on a year-to-date basis. But the second biggest driver has been our focus on the working capital. And, again, if you think about on a year-to-date basis, the net benefit of the working capital change was over $70 million versus last year. So, pretty strong effort on all of our teams in terms of driving order to cash. And so, sticking with that theme, that is a key focus for us for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019. And we're going to look to continue to improve on those results.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. The next question for Bob comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel. In the third quarter, you added 5,000 new carriers. Is that solely due to your efforts? Is that symptomatic of increasing capacity in the marketplace? Or is that conversion of company drivers and exclusive owner-operators as they see more opportunity in the brokered market?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So, it's difficult to answer this question with 100% certainty, but the answer probably has components of each of those factors in it. We do put a lot of effort into attracting new carriers to the Robinson and Navisphere platform. We feel really good about the affinity programs that we offer carriers, how we provide them earlier access to freight and the fact that we do have the largest network of freight in North America. And when we talk to our carriers, they tell us that they appreciate the dedicated account management that we provide them, unique customer solutions that they're able to participate in, and they find that our investments in technology really help them to run more effective and efficient businesses.","So, I can't give you 100% confidence as to why we added 5,000 carriers over the course of the quarter. I can offer that even in an environment where there's more competition from other companies looking to add capacity in the small carrier segment, we continue to see more carriers choosing Robinson. And those carriers are doing more business with us in a more automated manner than they ever have in the past.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. The next question for John comes from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan also asked a similar question. What do you believe drove the moderation in spot truckload pricing during the third quarter of 2018? Has incremental supply been added to the space? Or is it simply a moderation in activity following record second quarter levels? And any initial thoughts on the industry's supply\/demand balance looking into 2019?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","When you drill into the supply and demand relationship and look at the spot market versus committed metrics, maybe a basic reminder is that in that spot market component of it, there's probably two main feeders of it, right? In any given year, you have planned freight or committed freight that all shippers would be working through and a certain amount that you can't plan for either because it's more seasonal or it's more fragmented. Or oftentimes you'll have incremental shipments than maybe what you've planned for, and that's where excess demand would really drive increments to the spot market.","The other big feeder of the spot market is committed freight relationships that don't execute, where the freight falls all the way through the route guide and for pricing reasons or service reasons doesn't get executed. I think most of the metrics show that a lot of the spot market increase came from the fact that with these price adjustments, route guides were failing at a higher rate and that the committed freight relationships were breaking down. So, while we had these meaningful price increases \u2013 there is a strong economy and probably some demand in excess of overall planned levels, but the transitions of pricing and the changes in the committed route guide are probably the key thing that is causing the spot market to settle down as route guides perform more efficiently at higher price levels and the market comes back a little bit more into longer-term balance of committed and spot blends.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. The next question is for Bob. Several analysts have asked how does Robinson prioritize volume growth versus pricing growth in North America truckload into 2019. Which of these levers should drive the bulk of your revenue growth? And how confident are you in your ability to profitably gain share in a more balanced truckload market?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So, clearly, volume and pricing are the two main levers that can drive the truckload results, and we consistently talk internally about the theme of balanced growth. Within our office network, we're constantly talking about how we drive balanced growth in our organization. And we also are tuning our pricing algorithms and our tools to help achieve that.","Looking at 2019, we expect to grow truckload volume on a year-over-year basis. There's no question the past several quarters have been volatile. Pricing and costs have moved at unprecedented levels. And we've worked to be balanced between honoring our contractual commitments and managing spot market activities as routing guides have been disrupted.","Looking back at the past several years, many of which have been \"balanced,\" we've demonstrated the ability to consistently grow volume and earnings, and we expect that to continue into the future. So, we're really confident in our ability to adjust to market conditions, as we depicted in the earlier slides in the deck that showed both rate and cost over time and the impact to our gross transportation margins.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. Todd Fowler of KeyBanc and Matt Russell of Goldman Sachs asked about M&A. Andy, what are areas of strategic focus for the company from an acquisition standpoint, both from a service offering and geographic perspective? And how do valuations currently look?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. We continue to evaluate multiple opportunities both in North America and Europe across several different service lines, most of which we're already into, to one degree or another. I think if you look historically at what we've done, we've done a good job of growing our business both organically and augmenting it with acquisitions where it made sense, and Milgram being the most recent one.","Valuations have been healthy for some time, but we've always paid fair value for well-run organizations. That's been something that I think \u2013 if you think about how we've done acquisitions, we've really looked at and sought well-run organizations to bring into our organization because culture really does matter. And as far as what we see going forward, I think it'll be interesting of what valuations do, particularly if you think about the number of PE-led deals that are out there, as interest rates continue to rise, we're obviously watching closely the impact, if any, it'll have on those buyers and what they're willing to pay.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. The next question for John is from Fadi Chamoun of Bank of Montreal on volumes. While your truckload volume trends are improving, they are still down versus last year. Can you help us make sense of the continued volume declines in truckload?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","I think the answer here kind of piles onto Bob's messages around balanced growth over time. We certainly understand that over a longer period of time, over many years, the real foundation of value creation at Robinson is market share gains and expanding our volumes and growing those shipper relationships. Along that journey of balanced growth, we always have and still today optimize our performance around net revenue. It's the blend of volume and margin and returns to shareholders that we focus on. And I understand that in other environments, a pure growth model or different metrics around constantly chasing share would make you go after growth in all environments.","But we still believe that the right way to balance our stakeholders and to create returns for our shareholders is to balance that growth. And when you think about at times 20% year-over-year price increases and a lot of committed customer relationships where we're sourcing that capacity mostly transactionally, it's not unexpected that we would live through a pretty heavy transition of repricing and rebalancing that portfolio this year that would result in shedding of some volume. So, we feel pretty good about the results this year. We feel good about the transition that we're living through, and we understand that over a long period of time, continuing to demonstrate that we are able to gain market share and grow our business is at the core of that value creation.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks. The next question is also for John from Jack Atkins of Stephens. How are you guys thinking about freight flows in early 2019 as the 25% tariffs go into effect in January? Have your customers said anything about pulling freight forward at the end of this year?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","We mentioned a few comments around the tariffs. I would characterize this last quarter as things moving from, wow, do you think those will really happen and kind of planning for what tariffs might mean to pretty broad-based acceptance that they're likely going to happen. I mean some of them are obviously already in place, but the more meaningful ones that are coming, what we're seeing across that shipper and carrier base is much more meaningful planning to enact them. So, yes, on conversation about accelerating any amounts that you can, I don't know how much flexibility, it kind of varies by product or by shipper as to how much more you can actually produce or import prior to the tariffs taking impact. But that's certainly one lever.","Maybe the most significant theme around planning for tariffs that we've heard is sort of the acceleration of long-range plans in global supply chains. Many shippers had existing strategies or plans to migrate more of their sourcing to lower-cost regions, particularly across Asia, so maybe moving out of China to Vietnam or other low-cost regions in South Asia or India. So, we have been working with shippers for a while at a much more gradual pace on different sourcing transitions like that and probably, again, the most prevalent theme is just really the acceleration of some of those plans. We think we're in a pretty good spot to help those customers that are able to do that around moving their sourcing patterns to other parts of the world, and so we're optimistic that we can work through that.","Probably the scenario that often gets mentioned where maybe everybody loses is if the trade wars just deteriorate into recessions or in lost volumes and declines. Obviously, that's probably not good for either of the economies or for those of us that are making a living off of moving it around. So, right now as we've said a couple of times, overall demand remains strong and we're generally preparing for change much like we were a year ago on the domestic side with ELDs and the pending rules. We know that there's going to be some change and we're going to do the best that we can to get our customers through it and to grow our business as well.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Now to Bob, a number of analysts asked about head count. Please provide some color around head count expectations for the fourth quarter of 2018 and into 2019.","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So, relative to NAST, Global Forwarding, and Robinson Fresh, the expectation is that over time we're going to grow volume ahead of head count growth, and we're continuing to be focused on digital transformation of those businesses and redefining how and where we get work done. When we think about Europe and we think about Managed Services, they may be at a little bit different point in their growth curves, and we would expect that head count there is going to more closely mirror volume and revenue growth.","So, I guess the way that I'd think about this is if you look back in the past and you saw when we were a $10 billion company, we had 10,000 people, at a $15 billion company we had 15,000 people. As we look forward to being a $20 billion company, $25 billion company, the expectation is that we're not going to be at 20,000 people or 25,000 \u2013 20,000 people at $20 billion or 25,000 people at $25 billion. We expect that head count growth to moderate and us to really grow through the head count that we have given the work that we're doing. The other thing that I would add is that the makeup of our workforce continues to change and evolve. We've got fewer people pointed at task-oriented work and more people really focused on knowledge work, which changes the capacity of the workforce to execute the business that we have.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks. The next question is also for Bob from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please discuss some of C.H. Robinson's internal technology advancements, particularly relating to automated freight brokerage.","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So, we're really excited about the position of technology today and where we're at at Robinson. We've got a great team of over 900 IT professionals around the globe and we've got new leadership with our CTO Mike Neill. And we continue to attract and add great external talent in a really challenging IT labor market. We're also proud of the people that we've developed and promoted internally as well.","So, we're delivering a lot of new innovation and a lot of new products every day. For us, the agile has really evolved from being a way that we develop software to really how we think about managing business and bringing teams together across the enterprise. As I've said in previous comments, we're really committed to this digital experience across our customers, our carriers, and our employees. And that's really where we're investing our IT dollars today.","Related to the specific question of automated truck brokerage, that is a functionality that we have live today within our Navisphere platform in North America. So, we've got carriers every day automatically booking loads through our mobile application or through the web in a complete frictionless environment. So, we're pretty excited about that.","Carriers appreciate that ability and customers really appreciate the fully automated experience that they have with the Navisphere platform providing them frictionless transactions and real-time visibility to their inventory in motion. We've got over 40,000 users per day between our web and mobile applications that are managing their supply chains and finding efficiency in their businesses. So, we feel really good about the IT innovation, development, and the life cycle of our products and where we're at in that today.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. Andy, a number of analysts have asked about the ocean and air markets. What are the expected market conditions for air freight and ocean freight in the fourth quarter of 2018? How is this year's peak shaping up relative to last year?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah, I think our characterization of, from a macro perspective, both on the air and the ocean, it's a healthy market. It's been healthy this year, it's been healthy thus far in Q4. And we always talk about how the crystal ball is a bit cloudy. We don't see anything out there that would change our characterization of a healthy peak market, both in the air and ocean.","I think I'd use this opportunity, though, to maybe expand a little bit around as it relates to us. So, if you think about ocean net revenues being down, well, pricing and volume were both up in the ocean, so the gross revenues were up. We're continuing to grow that business. I think much like what happened in air last year, ocean got pinched because the carriers started taking up rates in advance. As customers started moving more volumes, carriers took up the rates, underlying rates, and I think much like we did with the air market, we got that corrected. And I think our talented Global Forwarding team will continue to correct rates to customers that are reflective of what happened with carriers.","On the air side, again, versus last year, we're seeing it as more balanced in our business on both the supply and demand. So, we feel really confident in the work that our team is doing. And, like I said, we've worked our way through the negative impacts that it had earlier this year. We expect \u2013 and our team out there in the Global Forwarding is a doing a great job, we would expect that to correct itself as well.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John on Robinson Fresh is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Robinson Fresh results improved sequentially compared to second quarter weakness as better margins offset lower top line. Can you provide an update on the strategy for this segment going forward?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","If you look at our Fresh division at, again, a very high level, there's two main things that we do in that division. We do the perishable transportation for fruits and vegetables, and account management would have a lot of the large retailers that we have those perishable relationships with. So, it's a component of our transportation services very similar to NAST that is focused on the perishable stuff.","We also source and distribute, buy and sell fresh fruits and vegetables under the Robinson Fresh brand and other brands that we work with. When you think about most of our discussion today around committed pricing and how the market has escalated from a pricing standpoint, all of those factors really hit the Robinson Fresh transportation in an even more accentuated way. The customer base in the Fresh division is typically much more of a committed pricing relationship from retailers that have promotions and yearlong standard costing where they need those fixed pricing arrangements.","The supply base for that perishable transportation is generally smaller, more fragmented owner-operators that were probably impacted even greater from an ELD standpoint in supply. So, a lot of what you see in the Robinson Fresh transportation is really just the accentuated impact of a lot of the items that we've been talking about in the NAST division.","On the product sale and distribution, a lot of times that is bundled service and our ability to execute is impacted by having access to capacity. And as we've said many times, we honor our committed relationships. And when more of that capacity is going to committed freight relationships and serving the accounts in that division, it really puts a challenge on the amount of available capacity to serve spot market opportunities.","Combined with some dislocation and product-specific stuff in different fruits and vegetable categories, it just put a lot of strain on the division. So, the long-term strategy is fairly similar. We want to continue to leverage the tools and the platform of Navisphere, and a lot of the effort that's being put into the overall freight management. We want to make sure that those perishable customers and that fresh transportation service benefits from that as well. So, as we manage the continuity of all of those services, you'll see more alignment across those divisions in terms of what we're working on, but overall the combination of providing products and transportation will be at the core of that division strategy.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. And also from Brandon Oglenski, a question on Milgram for Andy. With more than 12 months of operating Milgram, can you provide an update on integration and strategy? Your air and customs segments both continue to show strong growth trends.","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah, the update on the strategy is exactly the same. I mean we continue to grow our business organically and then complement that organic strategy with nice tuck-in acquisitions. And Milgram fits really nicely into that category. So, if you think about like phase one was bringing them in, that worked great. The agent business is fully transitioned, and we are really pleased with the results of the agent transition.","I would say the next phase that we're working into right now is to expand more of our traditional services into their existing customer base. And the Holy Grail of acquisitions is, of course, cross-selling and it takes a long time because these relationships go back quite a ways, particularly with our Canadian customers up there. After that, we would expect to add additional trade lanes into that beyond the ones that are in existence right now and then really begin to focus on the efficiency. So, really pleased with the acquisition. The team up there has just done a wonderful job, and so very, very happy.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. And our last question is for Bob from Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. How did your number of negative loads associated with contractual shipments trend in the third quarter of 2018 versus a year ago and against an average third quarter historically?","Robert C. Biesterfeld, Jr. - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Negative loads decreased sequentially from Q2 to Q3 as well as year-over-year within both our contractual and transactional business. So, we factor in the impact of the volume of negative loads and the decreases there. Our actual profitable truckload volume growth in Q3 2018 was actually positive in the low-single digits on a year-over-year basis. So, negative loads are still trending slightly above historical averages for a more traditional balanced market and it's a key metric that we continue to watch.","Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","That concludes the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. A replay of today's call will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com at approximately 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time today.

This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."],"4311":["C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) Q1 2017 Earnings Call April 26, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, Tim Gagnon will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, April 26, 2017.","I will now turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, the Director of Investor Relations.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. On our call this morning will be John Wiehoff, Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Clarke, Chief Financial Officer. John and Andy will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our first quarter results. We'll follow that with a response to the pre-submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday.","Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate our discussion. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Andy will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments.","I'd like to remind you that comments made by John, Andy or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","Before turning it over to John, I wanted to remind investors that last quarter we started reporting our business in three reporting segments based on accumulation of changes that have occurred during recent years.","Our three reportable segments are the Surface Transportation business in North America, the Global Forwarding business, which now represents over 20% of enterprise net revenues and the Robinson Fresh business.","With that, I'll turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments on slide three with a review of our first quarter results.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Tim. Our total revenues increased 11% in the first quarter. The revenue increase was the result of volume growth across all of our transportation services. Net revenues increased 1% in the quarter. The addition of APC Logistics accounted for approximately 2% of our total net revenue in the quarter.","Net revenues were negatively impacted by margin compression across most of our transportation services, with the truckload margin compression as the largest factor. Income from operations was 188 million, a decrease of 5.5%, and net income was up 2.6%. We had diluted earnings per share of $0.86 compared to $0.83 last year.","As noted on the slide, we did have a couple of discrete items that impacted the first quarter results that I want to highlight here, and Andy will cover more about them in his comments.","The first relates to our adoption of a new accounting rules for income taxes. That adoption resulted in a lower effective tax rate of 31.7% for the quarter. The second item references a credit that reduced our SG&A by $8.75 million related to the positive settlement of a legal claim. Again, more a common both of those, but I wanted to highlight them as discrete of items impacting our first quarter results.","Our average head count was up 7.8%, with APC accounting for approximately 2.5 percentage points of the overall head count growth. We've discussed the past couple of quarters that we continue to be in a tough part of the margin cycle in the North American truckload business. We felt that might be the case in the first half of 2017 and the first quarter results are indicative of a continuation of that environment. We've continued to take share across all of our services and we feel very good about our value proposition and how we're winning market share across all of our services and markets.","With that, I'll turn it over to Andy to review to review results from across the businesses.","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, John. I will begin my comments on slide four with the enterprise financials before moving to the reportable segments. We acknowledge it was a challenging quarter for earnings. However, I'd like to recognize all of our people for their great efforts in delivering 13% volume growth across all of the services. This growth is well ahead of the overall market and strong indication that the hard work of our people throughout the entire company is being recognized by our customers.","Onto the summarized income statement. For the first quarter operating expenses increased 4.5% to $381 million. Personnel expenses increased 4.7% in the quarter. The primary reason for the increase in personal expense was the addition of people in the three business segments and in technology as our average head count rose 7.8% in the quarter.","We invested in talent to support the double-digit volume growth in the business units and additionally, we are adding to the IT team to support the execution of our technology initiatives and the continued enhancement of them Navisphere platform.","Approximately 30% of the additional head count was a result of the APC acquisition, which is added nicely to our top line growth. The increase in head count cost were partially offset by our variable compensation plans where both cash and equity incentives were lower in the quarter.","SG&A expenses increased 3.7% in the first quarter and were impacted by a couple of items. We had previously reported the settlement of a legal claim, which reduced SG&A by 8.75 million in this line item. That benefit was offset partially by a higher allowance for doubtful accounts of about $3.5 million, an increase in purchase services of about $4 million and approximately $3 million increase in acquisition amortization.","For the quarter, our operating income as a percent of net revenue was 33.1%, a decrease of 220 basis points from last year. The effective tax rate during the quarter was 31.7% versus 37 .4% last year.","The tax rate was lower as a result of the tax benefit related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the quarter. The effect of adoption of the accounting standards update was to lower our effective taxes paid by $9.3 million.","The first quarter will have the largest impact to the tax rate as a result of the way our compensation timing works. For the remaining quarters in 2017, we expect a tax rate between 36% and 37%. This rate will fluctuate based on the value of the shares, as well as a percentage of pre-tax profits generated outside the United States.","Moving on to slide five and other financial information, we generated nearly $93 million in cash in the quarter, and had just under $17 million in capital expenditures. The largest driver in the decrease in cash flow from operations during the quarter was the increase in accounts receivable.","This occurrence is normal during periods of accelerating top line growth as well as increases in the cost of fuel. We finished the quarter with $230 million in cash, and our debt balance remains $1.24 billion. For the year 2017, we expect total capital expenditures to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million.","On to slide six, and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately 113 million share shareholders in the quarter with just under $65 million in dividends and approximately $48 million in share repurchases. For the quarter, we returned 92% of our income to shareholders in line with our objectives.","On to slide seven, and net revenue by service. As a reminder, this slide represents the services revenue for all of our business units. I will not spend a lot of time on this slide, but rather will make comments about the various service revenues within the business segments.","Moving to slide eight and our North American truckload price and cost chart. The graph on slide eight represents a few key metrics for the North American truckload business.","On this graph, the light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in North American truckload rate per mile to customers and carriers net of fuel costs since 2008. The gray line is the net revenue margin for all transportation services.","In this year's first quarter, the North American truckload rate per mile, net of fuel, fell 4% versus last year's first quarter while cost per mile fell 2%. The 4% decrease in customer pricing represented a step down versus the fourth quarter and this is reflective of both our contractual and transactional pricing. The cost per mile reverted to negative year-over-year versus being flat in the fourth quarter.","The North American truckload market remains fairly balanced as it has been for the past few quarters, and pricing is very competitive given the fact that capacity is available and demand is tepid. From a shipment perspective, they are feeling the impact of a 25% increase in diesel prices in the first quarter, and that is certainly pressuring their freight budgets.","We do believe that the market conditions will improve later in the year as the ELD mandate draws closer and the remaining carriers implement ELDs and realize a productivity impact related to the transition.","Moving to slide nine and our transportation results. Total transportation revenues for all segments were up $14.3 billion to $3.1 billion in the first quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this is a result of our strong volume growth of 13% across all of our services in the quarter.","Transportation net revenue margin decreased approximately 240 basis points from last year's first quarter to 17.3%. This was primarily the result of lower margins, and most of the transportation services with North American truckload margin compression having the greatest impact. Margin compression had an approximate 170 basis-point negative impact on margins in the quarter. Fuel also had a negative impact of 60 basis points, with diesel pricing up 25%.","For the first time in four quarters, the net revenue margins, on overall transportation rose, albeit slightly, by 10 basis points as a result of mix shift and more LTL and global forwarding business.","On to slide 10 and the reportable segments. We refer to North American Surface Transportation division as NAST. The NAST business is comprised of offices in the United States, Mexico and Canada, providing primarily truckload, less than truckload and intermodal services to consumers.","NAST total revenues were $2.3 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 10.5% over last year's first quarter. NAST net revenues decreased 3% to $372 million in the quarter. Net revenue margin in NAST was 16.5% compared to last year's first quarter of 18. 8%. The lower margins were primarily the result of a lower customer pricing in the truckload business.","NAST operating expenses decreased 2.2% in the first quarter of 2017. This decrease was largely due to the collection of the previously discussed legal claim as well as decreases in variable personnel expenses.","Income from operations was down 4% to $156 million. NAST operating margin was 41.9% in the quarter. Employee count was 6,844, up 2.7%. We achieved solid productivity for person gains in the NAST business as volumes grew across the various services and combined 10%.","The margin of compression meets the productivity gains in the quarter, but we feel really good about the fact that our initiatives around digitalization and leveraging our scale are yielding solid results.","Now on to slide 11 and the results by service within NAST. John and I have highlighted some of the factors impacting our truckload business in the quarter. NAST truckload net revenues were down $16 million or 5.7%. Volumes were up 11% in the quarter as a result of growth in both our contractual and transactional shipments.","We added 3,600 new carriers in the first quarter compared to approximately 2,600 in last year's first quarter. These new carriers moved over 18,000 shipments for us in the first quarter. The less than truckload business had another solid growth quarter with net revenues up 7.1% to $93.5 million.","Volumes increased 8.5% when compared to the first quarter of last year. Pricing was up slightly, and net revenue margins were down slightly as we purchased transportation costs increased during the quarter.","Intermodal net revenues decreased 17.3% in the quarter. However, volumes were up 14%. Over the past several quarters, we have been growing the contractual business at lower margins while transactional volumes are down quite a bit from last year's first quarter.","On to Global Forwarding on slide 12. Total revenues for Global Forwarding segment in the first quarter were $469 million, up 33.5% versus last year. First quarter net revenues were $106.5 million, a 14.7% increase from 2016.","APC Logistics was a significant contributor to this success in Global Forwarding, adding approximately 14% of the net revenue in the quarter. Our teams continue to do a nice job with the integration.","Net revenue margin was 22.8%, down 360 basis points year-over-year. While we feel good about the progress in volume growth our teams are making, we did experience margin compression during the quarter primarily on the Ocean business.","Income from operations was $16.2 million, down 3.9% in the first quarter. Operating margin was 15.2% in the quarter. The lower operating margin versus last year's first quarter was primarily the result of a lower net revenue margins and the acquisition amortization related to the purchase of APC. Headcount increased 12.6% in the quarter, with APC representing just over 300 employees or approximately 9% of additional employees in the business.","Moving on to the Global Forwarding service lines on slide 13. Ocean net revenues were up 8.3% in the quarter, and APC contributed approximately 11.5% to the growth. Ocean's shipments increased approximately 27% in the quarter, and pricing was up in the ocean service line. The margin compression in the ocean service line, however, was primarily in the \u2013 our contractual business.","Approximately 25% of our organic ocean volume has fixed pricing with customers and the increases in our cost per shipment impacted our first quarter margins. Air net revenues increased 17.2%. APC contributed approximately 12% to the growth. Air shipments increased approximately 38.6% in the quarter and pricing was again down.","Our sales efforts are yielding good results and the team is excited about the momentum they are building, particularly in the global air consolidation centers. Customs net revenue increased 50%, with APC contributing approximately 37% to the growth. Customs transactions increased approximately 37.8% in the first quarter.","Transitioning to our Robinson Fresh business on slide 14. Robinson Fresh, which is our global logistics and product division, is focused on fresh, temperature controlled supply chain. With our new reporting segment, we now share results inclusive of revenues from sourcing and transportation services whereas previously, we only reported sourcing revenue and rolled sourcing transportation up into the consolidated transportation reporting.","Robinson Fresh total revenues were $550 million, a decrease of 2.4% in the first quarter. Net revenues were $57 million, down 2.3% from last year.","Robinson Fresh operating expenses increased 4.3% in the first quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased head count to serve the 29% truckload volume growth, and an increase in SG&A expenses. Income from operations was $14.6 million, a decrease of 17.4%. And Robinson Fresh head count increased 4.2% in the quarter.","Robinson Fresh sourcing total revenue declined 13.1%. The decrease in total revenue was a result of market pricing being down approximately 12% per case sold because of a supply surplus. Even with the lower gross sales, our product team did a nice job managing through these conditions and grew product net revenue by 3.9% year-over-year.","Net revenue margin increased a 160 basis points in the first quarter as a result of the lower product cost driving a higher net revenue per case in our strategic and market commodities. I want to make a special callout to the sourcing team for the work they've done in Q1 by focusing on new and existing customer growth.","Robinson Fresh transportation total revenues increased 16.4% in the first quarter of 2017, driven by impressive volume growth of 24%.","Robinson Fresh transportation net revenue decreased 8.6% in the first quarter of 2017, due primarily to truckload net revenue declining 10.7% in the quarter. Similar to our other transportation services, we believe we are gaining share and we continue to be optimistic about our growth in the long term.","Moving to all other and corporate on slide 17. The all other category includes our Managed Services business, as well as Surface Transportation outside of North America and other miscellaneous revenues, as well as unallocated corporate expenses. Headcount was up 17.1%, and this was primarily the result of increases in technology, other enterprise resources and managed services.","Net revenues for the other category increased 14.9% in the first quarter of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, led by the continued strong performance in our Managed Services and our Surface Transportation business in Europe.","Managed Services net revenue increased 17.9% in the first quarter of 2017 to $17.2 million, compared to $14.6 million in the first quarter of 2016. This increase the result of growth from both new and existing customers. Other surface transportation increased 11.8% in the first quarter of 2017 to $15.6 million, compared to $13.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. Again, primarily the result of growth in the European surface transportation business. Both businesses continue to be very profitable, with the decrease in operating income during the quarter being the result of some unallocated overhead expenses.","Before I turn it back to John, I'd like again to thank my colleagues for their continued hard work and dedication. With that, John will make some closing comments before we answer your questions.","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thank you, Andy. Before going on to those questions, I'm going to share some thoughts on our final comments on slide 19.","In April to-date, our total company net revenue has decreased approximately 4% per business day. This includes the additional revenue from the APC acquisition. The timing of the Easter holiday has been a small headwind for us in April, and we also had a strong April last year as this was our strongest month in the second quarter a year ago.","Our North America truckload volume growth remains consistent with the first quarter and thus far in April. Overall, the market conditions remained fairly consistent with the past couple of quarters thus far in April.","We typically close our prepared comments with some thoughts about our longer-term strategies and how we are planning to invest in our future growth. As most of you know, we'll be hosting an Investor Day session next week that will be webcasted that will update our future plans for each of our businesses. I'll close my prepared comments by highlighting some of the topics that we'll be addressing next week for those want to hear more.","With regards to segment strategies, we have both enterprise and divisional strategies and growth initiatives. We'll be having our divisional leaders share updates on their respective strategies for each of the services as well as discussing how we work together as one team to share investments and leverage our network for better customer outcomes.","With regards to capital allocations, Andy shared the capital distribution update for the quarter in an earlier slide. While we will remain committed to our target of distributing 90% of our net income, we'll also continue to explore ways to utilize our strong balance sheet as we have in the past by investing close to $1 billion in our Global Forwarding division over the past five years.","With regards to market share opportunities, market share gains driven by effective sales and account management remain at the core of how we grow and create value. Each of our leaders will be discussing their plans for continued growth and market share gains.","And lastly, both the competitive landscape and the investments in technology and our industry continue to grow and change very quickly. We are investing significantly more in our technology, and we're excited to share some perspective on our priorities and where we're investing to support our future growth.","So that concludes our prepared comments for the quarter. And with that, I will turn it back to Tim to lead the question-and-answer session of the call.","Operator","Mr. Gagnon, the floor is yours for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Donna, and first I would like to thank all of the analysts and investors for taking the time to submit some really good questions late yesterday.","I'll frame up those questions as they were submitted, and turn it over to John or Andy for their response. And we'll get right into that now.","The first question is for Andy. How much of the 19% year-over-year increase in operating cost is Global \u2013 came from Global Forwarding and from APC in the quarter? What were the main drivers of the Global Forwarding expenses?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yes, approximately 16% of the 19% increase in the operating cost in Global Forwarding were the results of APC. Included in that number is approximately $3 million of the amortization expense from the acquisition.","Our volume growth outside of APC was 18%, and I think the Global Forwarding team did a very nice job of managing their head count growth as well as their overall operating expenses with such high volume growth in that.","Remaining additional part, as John and I have talked about, is the increase in technology spend and the investments that we're making in that area to obviously help us with long-term productivity gains.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Personnel expense increases up 4.7% year-over-year this quarter continue to outpace revenue growth resulting in a reduced net income per head count. While on-boarding has appeared to slow, it is still up by 655 people, or 5.9% for 1Q. What levers are being utilized to support operating income per head count as it continues to decrease sequentially and year-over-year?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So those are some of the very important metrics that we do look at in terms of managing the efficiency and the productivity of our business. I would say that the headline answer to that question is this net revenue margin compression that we talked about throughout our prepared comments. If you look particularly within NAST, but all of the businesses, when we had an 11% transaction increase and a decrease in the net revenue that resulted from that, it does put a lot of productivity pressure on the network where our core productivity metric has been shipments per person and looking at the activity levels for \u2013 across our network. So when we have this part of the cycle where we have net revenue margin compression like we experienced this quarter, it does put pressure on our operating income per person.","One of the reasons why we implemented segment reporting is that as we've grown and diversified our business, it is very helpful to look at the pieces of that question. We've talked quite a bit about Global Forwarding and the APC acquisition. If you look at that segment, that is where the most significant operating income relationship changed, in part because of the purchase accounting expenses that come in there, and part because of the additional head count.","We like the Global Forwarding business. The ROI on that investment has been very positive to-date, but it does change some of the internal metrics with people spread around the world in a different type of business relationship. Similarly, in our corporate and other, where you see the largest head count growth around managed services and IT investments, we do have a different framework for looking at investment of talent in that area.","So while the metrics that were pointing out are accurate, that the operating income per head count goes down, part of it cyclical, part of it varies across the different businesses that we have, and we will continue to manage that metric as best as we can.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. The next question for Andy. Interest expense increase sequentially to $9.3 million in the first quarter. Is that a good run rate going forward?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","There are three components to that figure. And the first one is, which is fixed, is our long-term debt. It's $500 million and it's a fixed rate. The second portion of that is our short-term debt, and there's two components that are impacting that. One, the number is bigger versus last year due to the acquisition of APC. And secondarily, it's floating and it's tied to LIBOR, and LIBOR has been up over that same time period. And so as LIBOR goes, you would expect our interest rate that we pay to fluctuate with that.","The third function that's in there is foreign currency translations and the adjustments that are in there, and given that there is now nearly 20% of our business that's being generated outside of the United States, there is foreign currency fluctuations that roll through that line item.","So, it's those three issues that are impacting it. The $9.3 million is a relatively good number but there is variability to that subject to foreign currency as well as LIBOR.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. To John with the next question. NAST net revenue margin improved sequentially, but operating margin ex the legal claim declined. What caused this divergence? Any color on the expected cadence for the remainder of the year would be appreciated as well?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","This is really the follow on question to the first topic I addressed, only directed specifically at NAST around their net revenue margin versus the operating margins.","Within the NAST results for the quarter, the real headline is the net revenue margin compression that caused that deterioration. I'll repeat what I had stated earlier. When you have that type of volume growth \u2013 and we are proud of the fact that we accommodated, and our network was able to manage that volume growth with a 3% head count within NAST. But when your net revenue margin compresses that much it is what drives the operating margin deterioration.","In terms of the cadence for the rest of the year, we've talked often about \u2013 it was kind of middle of 2016 where we saw a pretty significant change in the margins. So we do know that we have at least another quarter of more challenging margin comparisons for 2017.","As we mentioned, our run rate of volume growth continues in April, so we would expect the results in the short-term future to be consistent with the past couple of quarters.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. How much business does Amazon do with Robinson on a gross revenue measure, and how aggressive have they been with pricing? Have they approached Robinson about becoming a larger intermodal partner?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah. It's been our longstanding policy to not comment on the specifics of any customer, and if you look at our overall customer dynamics, we don't have a single customer that accounts for more than 2% of our gross revenue, and Amazon is not our largest customer, although they're in our top 50 customer.","I would say that you would expect us and all of our account reps and all of our people across the 14,000 employees that we have worldwide to talk to every one of our customers about every one of the services that we provide.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question to John. What's driving total company net revenue per day down 4% April to date?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","We addressed some of the April activity in the final comments that we prepared. You know, I guess what I would repeat is that there is a timing of the Easter Holiday which can impact the beginning of the April. The previous year, April was our strongest month in terms of second quarter growth last year so there could be some minor comparison challenge in that.","So mostly it's a continuation of the same environment that we had in the first quarter, where there's high volume growth, and some net revenue margin compression. I think whenever we share kind of these mid-month numbers, things can change quite a bit with month-end push and other activities, so we like to give it a just a general gauge of what's happening. But I would say it's safe to sort of state that we are seeing activity that's pretty comparable to what we experienced in the first quarter.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question to Andy. Please review what accounts for the sharply higher volume growth of the last three quarters in NAST, specifically North America truck load. These last three quarters have a pattern of continued lower pricing, but where the pricing is actually now falling more than your lower purchased transportation cost. Is this a function of re-contracting at prices lower than your falling cost, but in such a way that you were winning more volume?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yes, we'll start off by first addressing NAST in general. And as we talked about, I think we've done a great job in the entire NAST organization, both in the truck load growing volumes 11% in the quarter, LTL growing volumes 8.5%, and intermodal growing volumes at 14%. And so if you think about, what I would call the sell, and how do we go out and attract volume, and it's primarily through a couple of key elements.","One is our people. We have great people out in the organization right now and account managers and sales reps and the carrier reps and everybody that works in that area of going out and aggressively pursuing market share. So I think those type of volume growths that we've consistently seen over the last several quarters are really a recognition of the fact that our people are winning on a more frequent basis. And they're winning with the use of additional technology.","So when we go out on that commitment and contractual business, your customers, our customers are intelligent, they know where the market is, and we've got a be right there with them, and we're using data analytics, and we're using technology and we're using science to really win. And if you think about the percentage increase on a year-over-year basis where we're winning, it's up 400 basis points on that contractual business. So we really focus on those key elements.","And even in the transactional business, there's more technology, and there's more resources that we're bringing to bear for our people. And our people are smart \u2013 and we're developing talent across the organization to help us win that business. So that's on the sell side.","Now when you go out into the buy side, there's a lot of different factors that impact that. And as we talk about over the last three or four years, that committed and contractual business roughly bounces between 60%. Some quarters it's up a little, some quarters it's down, and the remaining 40% is in the spot.","But when we go out to actually buy the capacity is the vast majority, 90 plus percent, is in that spot market. And again, I think we have really talented people that are going out there and buying very well and very effectively every day in that marketplace. And what you see is, over the long term, the trend lines of the routing guides. And that's really kind of important, and there's a nuance to it. When we go to set that pricing, as I mentioned earlier, you're setting committed and contractual prices for whether it's six months or a year in advance and you're predicting what will happen. Ultimately, what does happen is where things fall out on the routing guide.","And if you'd looked at this time last year the routing guide were in the low ones, which means, guess what? People are getting their freight covered rather effectively. As we went through the year, that routing guide started to bounce up off of the low floor, low one floor, into the mid-ones, and it's kind of stayed in that range, and there's some variability month to month in that, but it's stayed in that range, and so our people are using all that information to go out and attract more business, and at the same time I think really do an effective job in this marketplace of pricing it accordingly.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. With more business running under contractual arrangements, do you think there is a risk that margins compress more quickly than the market might expect in the event that truck market tightens?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","One of the reasons why we added slide eight to our deck, that Andy shared some prepared comments about, is it shows, over the last decade, how our pricing to our customers and our costs of hire has varied and stayed together. And you can see on the chart from that last decade that there are periods of time where, you know, those two \u2013 the buy and sell rate will separate for a period of time, but what we like about the graph is it shows that over a decade, our business model and our teams are very disciplined at getting them back in line.","It's true that as more of the business has become committed or contractual, you do have a little bit more price risk in terms of a significant change in market conditions around tightening capacity, a lot of discussion about whether the ELD requirements in December will be an event like that. If you look on that chart over the last decade, there were other CSA safety and hours of service type regulatory changes that had some impact on capacity that don't show up as all that significant.","Who knows if the ELD event will be as well, but overall I guess we're proud of the fact that our business model adjusts for those types of market events, and we feel pretty confident about our ability to adjust to the market conditions if capacity does tighten significantly.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question to Andy. Why was Coyote's aggressive pursuit of market share such a challenge for you when they were growing rapidly in 2012 and 2013? Why don't you expect Uber and Amazon to push into the freight brokerage markets to post a similar challenge for your business?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Well, I'm glad you asked that question in the form that it was actually written, and I'll address the Coyote. But as it relates to \u2013 I don't think that's our perspective and opinion that Amazon and Uber won't have an impact to the marketplace. And I'll address that in a second.","If you think about over any historical period that dovetails with what John had mentioned, there's the cyclical trends and then the secular trends, and the cyclical trends our outsourcing is increasing, and we like that because it's what we do. And I think that we've been leading that industry for quite some period of time.","Other competitors have entered the marketplace at different points in the cycle, and it tends to really show itself on a more material basis when the marketplace is balanced. So you go back to that time period that was mentioned, 2011, 2012, 2013, and the marketplace was balanced, which is kind of if you look at routing guides during that same time period is where they are today. So it feel like it's more balanced.","Routing guides are more effective and they are more efficient, and loads are getting covered efficiently and effectively. And as a result, we went and got volume during that time period as well, and we were growing high single-digits, low double-digits during that period. So we were as aggressive in that marketplace as any of our competitors.","If you look at today, and you look at the entrance of new competitors, and \u2013 by the way, all the ones that existed previously are still competing with us today. Whether they're independent or whether they were acquired, they're still competing in that marketplace.","What we like about the \u2013 just from a macro perspective, thinking about the entrance of competitors, we think it validates the marketplace. We have for the longest time talked about the 3PL marketplace and the penetration of the overall for-hire truckload marketplace. And it started maybe a decade ago at the low-single digits and now it's 15%, 16%, 18% of the marketplace. We like the fact that when reputable competitors come in, it acknowledges the fact of what we do. It acknowledges the fact of what our people do, and we believe it's going to continue to drive up the acceptance and therefore the penetration rate of this brokerage and of the 3PL marketplace.","We like they are bringing technology to bear. We like they are bringing people to bear. We like they are bringing relationships to bear to compete. And so we take seriously all of our competitors, regardless of the form that they take.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Have you noticed any significant changes in the ocean freight markets with the new alliances that launched this month? What kind of impact is that having on your business and how can you adjust?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","The short answer to the question is \"no\", that we have not seen any impact on our business in the month of April. For those who may not be familiar with it, in the ocean industry there are vessel-sharing alliances, and the ocean carriers in those alliances made some changes and adjustments so that as of April 1st, there are new alliances that they're operating under.","The primary impact to us historically and kind of going forward is that when we work with a customer that has a diversified carrier strategy, we have to make certain that by utilizing different carriers you're not actually putting the freight on the same vessel, even though you're using a different carrier because they're sharing the vessels. If you're worried about weather or different service disruptions, you want to make sure that you execute a diversified strategy by truly having alternative routes and different ways to ship your freight.","The changes that were made April 1st over the long-term could have some meaningful impact. We have not seen any of that to date. We do have a team that aligns closely with all of those carrier groups and makes certain that as they change their routing and alliance procedures that we're able to adapt with them, and we feel pretty confident about being able to do that as well.","So the short answer is no, no immediate impact thus far in April, and we've worked through the alliance transitions before, and we will work through these and feel good about how we'll be able to manage it.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. How much over-supply of capacity is there in the current truckload market? How does that compare to where the year started?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","I wouldn't say that there's any material change from where the year started. It goes back to the routing guides, and routing guides are working very efficiently right now.","We continue to add capacity, and we talk about the 3,600 carriers that we added during the quarter, which is up from Q1 of last year. And again, the nets about the same, we're still losing carriers as well, or carriers that are not running for us, and they covered 18,000 loads.","It's \u2013 if you think about the overall tepid demand environment, the CAS (42:47) figures I believe for March were only up 0 .9%, and that was trending down through the quarter. It's not as much of a capacity story as it is demand.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. To John. Should we expect CHRW to continue hiring at this rate for the remainder of the year?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","We do expect to continue to hire throughout 2017. If you kind of piece together the comments in our presentations and Q&A thus far, you know within the Global Forwarding division we had the APC acquisition that accelerated the increase in head count over the periods that we're talking about. So their growth going forward would not be at the same pace as it's been for the past couple of quarters.","In terms of managed services, corporate and other and the IT spending that we've mentioned a few times, we do expect to continue to invest in both of those areas. We have a committed backlog of future contracts to implement, so we know that we'll be bringing talent on and there will be an investment that's more future oriented around implementation costs and automation initiatives that we expect to benefit for the longer-term future.","The other business units, we do expect them to continue to hire as well, particularly if the volume growth that we're experiencing continues, but that would be at a more modest pace like you saw during the quarter in the segment results as well.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. Net revenue growth in the first quarter was 0.9%. However, personnel expenses were up 4.7%. How much of this is tied to bonus incentive comp accruals versus head count growth, and should we be thinking about personnel expenses growing faster than net revenue for the remainder of this year given your investment in head count and IT?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yes, and to dovetail with a number of questions that have been asked and the answers that we've given, the net revenue growth of 0.9% was masked by the fact that volumes were growing at 13%, and personnel expenses up 4.7% on a 13% growth, when you're in a very challenging margin compression environment, it just \u2013 it kind of masks, I think, a lot of the good work that's occurring.","The personnel expenses, that 4.7%, the dollar amounts were driven up by the fact that headcounts are up by nearly 8%, so the salaries associated with that are driving it up. The variable portion of compensation, be that our cash bonuses, as well as equity incentives, are down on a quarter-over-quarter basis.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Can you remind us of the net revenue growth per day comps for the second quarter of 2016 by month? Also, can you provide the monthly net revenue per day for the first quarter of 2017?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","So if you look at the first quarter that we just reported on with our overall 1% net revenue increase, the months January, February, March went plus 2%, minus 2%, plus 2%. So a little bit of fluctuation. Again, there's different number of business days and a number of things that can impact that. So a little bit of fluctuation, but nothing too significant.","Last year, second quarter of 2016, we had shared at that time that our daily net revenue growth for April, May, June was plus 9%, flat, and minus 3%. So I believe I had made the comment earlier in one of the questions that as far as Q2 of this year is concerned, that April would be our most challenging comparison based upon the growth from the prior year, and looking at the daily activity in April, it's fairly consistent with the first quarter. It's just that we have a little bit different comparison.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question to Andy on ocean services. Ocean pricing increased for the first quarter in almost two years. What did you see in the marketplace?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah. The ocean pricing has been, and is still at historical lows, and there's variability around that. You think about coming in to the first quarter, you had a combination of the Chinese New Year, as well as the Hanjin bankruptcy, still the after effects of that bleeding in to 2017, but still very, very historical lows in terms of what the ocean costs are.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. What impact, if any, do you expect Amazon.com to have on the brokerage market, specifically market share and net revenue margins once its brokerage platform goes live later this year?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","One of the things we'll be talking about next week in our Investor Day is just this escalation of activity in the competitive landscape. Andy touched on the point earlier that while we've acknowledged, and everyone understands that our industry has become much more competitive over the last decade, that part of the positive trade-up on that is the expansion of the addressable market, and that particularly more recently a lot of these non-traditional competitors coming in to this space are coming in with the belief that the entire market is addressable, and not just the brokerage component of it.","So I'm not \u2013 Amazon hasn't been specific to kind of their go-to-market strategies or where in the big universe they are going to go after things. The only comment I'm aware of is with regards to whether it's final mile or ocean activities or longer-haul trucking. They have stated that they expect significant growth in their own business to continue, and that a lot of these investments will initially be focused on accommodating some of their own growth and then expanding more into a broader market services after that.","I have no idea if that's what their brokerage platform intents are, but that would be consistent with kind of what they've said in other areas of the supply chain that they want to invest and grow in.","So as I'll repeat again what Andy said earlier that we do think that digital transformations and all of the changes that we're going through and that are happening in our industry will have a very material impact, especially over the next decade or so as they all get traction and continue to make a greater and greater impact. And as far as what any one of them has in terms of the verticals or areas of the marketplace that they want to focus on initially, or what the short-term impact might be, it's difficult to assess at this point.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. To Andy, an ELD question. Has there been ELD discussions between Robinson and shippers or carriers? Do you expect the mandate to impact your carrier base? If so, what steps are you taking to be prepared for potential truck capacity tightening?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah. This has been a topic that's not only top of mind for investors, but as you would imagine, top of mind for our customers and top of mind for our carriers. So we're having conversations every day with each of those respective parties. And it's difficult to categorize them in any one way, shape or form. So on the one hand, we talk to our customers and say that ELDs will have an impact to the overall marketplace, whether it be the actual availability of capacity or the productivity of that capacity.","And yet, when we have those conversations, it seems like that the pricing environment continues to be challenged, because as I mentioned previously, routing guides are operating very effectively. And the desire to say lock-in or do something in advance of December is \u2013 it's just been very challenging in those conversations with customers despite the fact that we, they and everybody else know that it's coming.","We have conversations with the carriers as well. And the good news, if you think about the bifurcation of the marketplace, whether it be small carriers, whom we contract with, or large carriers which we also contract with, we believe that it's a marketplace, and marketplaces ultimately adjust and adapt to what occurs. We believe that we are well positioned. We talk to our smaller carriers, and we have smaller carriers. In fact, we have single owner\/operators that we recently had a conversation with that are ELD compliant today, and believe that they can continue to be compliant and productive and profitable despite the fact that they are running an ELD.","And so, while there will be a disruption of some sort, that has yet to be (51:31), because we're still adding capacity in the marketplace right now, and we believe we will continue to do that. And when you have an effective and efficient marketplace, when there's dislocations and disruptions, people like C.H. Robinson are very effective in helping our customers secure that capacity. Whether we continue to do it in the small marketplace, which we will, or also access and tap the larger truck marketplace.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Technology question for John. How do you more effectively use technology to leverage head count?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","We have initiatives across all of our business areas to drive productivity and to drive efficiency by using automation and digital transformation. There will be a lot more presented about that next week again by our various leaders.","You know, kind of using NAST, the biggest part of our business as probably the primary example, when you talk about the volume growth versus the more limited head count growth in the quarter. NAST itself is, you know, in the midst of a multi-year transformation, or reinvention around how our President, Bob Biesterfeld and his leadership team, are really changing the job families and the approach within the network to make sure that we better utilize the new automation, the new tools that we're creating to drive that productivity.","Examples would be that we share data electronically far more aggressively than we did even five years ago. The number of EDI and API interactions that exchange data with both shippers and carriers have gone up significantly. The track and trace information that check-call stuff that was done more manually in the past, a lot of effort around automating that. A lot of algorithms to help you find a truck more effectively. A lot of pricing tools that can help you move quicker.","So just across the business, there's a number of different initiatives of how we're structuring the network, how we're leveraging the automation tools, and we're already seeing some pretty positive results like we did in the first quarter with regards to the NAST business.","So I could share analogies in each of the other areas. I don't think there's any one silver bullet or one giant thing that is driving that digital transformation. It's the combination of a lot of initiatives spread across the entire business that, again, we'll be sharing more about in the future.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question, again, for Andy on capacity. Could you comment on what you're seeing from the small fleets, one to 20 trucks? Are you seeing some of your carriers exit the industry, or is capacity expanding?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Go back to \u2013 we continue to add capacity in the marketplace at a greater rate than we've lost it. So adding 3,600 companies, and those 3,600, as you would imagine, all have less than 20 trucks.","We continue to lose it, but not at a greater rate than what we've seen over the last three or four or five quarters. So I wouldn't categorize it as expanding or contracting. I would say it's more a continuation of the status quo.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. To John again on competition. Technology impact on the competitive landscape. Are you seeing the transactional business becoming more commodity-like versus the stickier, specialized, perhaps, contractual business?","John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","I would say that over the last decade or more, as we've evolved our business more in to committed or contracted type freight relationships, the technology has obviously had significant impact on both that business, as well as the traditional transaction or more spot market relationships.","There is pretty significant differences between the two. Like I mentioned earlier, around the exchange of information, the tendering of freight, the tendering of status updates, a lot of the automation that happens in that more committed business does make it stickier, and does benefit from a degree of technology and automation that is more long-term. It requires more of an investment up front, but then has more of an investment relationship to it over time.","In the spot market, competition and automation are having a significant impact too, but it's probably more driven at pricing and kind of reacting quicker and making sure that you're interacting with both the shippers and the capacity side by whatever means their preference is. A lot of it is still telephone. Some of it we have what we think is as good a mobile App as anyone. There's a lot of different ways to interact in the marketplace, and in that spot market world it's less about customization and unique interfaces with somebody and more about making sure that you have a wide array of exposure and able to accommodate whatever variation of capacity is out there.","So we have seen kind of this divergent -- divergence in the competitive landscape around the types of automation and the types of things that it takes to be competitive in both transactional and committed business.","Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. Can you talk about productivity or net revenue employee trends by segment, and address what impact recent forwarding acquisitions is having on this metric?","Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Yeah. Good question. And I'm going to take it maybe even a couple layers deeper, which is \u2013 and let's start with the evolution of the company over the last decade, and net revenues are up roughly 8%, 9% over that last decade, and we've been able to grow both organically within our North America Surface Trans and organically and via acquisition on the other parts of our business, and they each have different metrics that are associated with them.","Inside of NAST, as an example, truckload now represents 52%, 53% of our overall net revenue to the organization. So not only have we done a good job within our NAST organization with truckload, but doing things like adding LTL and intermodal have had an impact on those productivity metrics. So it's hard to simply say, you know, the net revenue per person has done different things. And they have, because of the different investments that we've made. But we've also made I think really good investments in our people and the services that we offer.","So today, you think about LTL being nearly $100 million of net revenue, that adds an entirely different metric in terms of not only net revenue per transaction but also net revenue per person, because it's a much more highly automated function than, say, truckload.","Then when you get into Global Forwarding and you think about the investments that we made, not only in terms of the people and the technology, and \u2013 but it's a different margin, you know, it's 22% net revenue margins \u2013 pardon me, nearly 23% net revenue margins this quarter versus 16.5% net revenue margins in our North American Surface Trans, and within that you've got customs, which is highly automated. You've got ocean, which we do a lot of less-than-container-load consolidations, as well as air consolidation shipments. And the growth rate in that organization, and the fact that we now have employees throughout the globe, and they have different cost metrics associated with them, so we have nearly 1,500 people in Asia, and they're wonderful and they do great work, but as you would imagine, looking simply at a net revenue per person in that function, they have a much lower cost per person in that function as well.","So it did, if you just looked at the overall metric itself, the net revenue per person has come down when we did the Global Forwarding acquisitions, but it comes at a higher net revenue margin and it comes at a lower cost per person in those key geographies where we compete.","Timothy D.
