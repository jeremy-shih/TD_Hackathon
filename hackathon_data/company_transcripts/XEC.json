All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Karen Acierno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Karen Acierno - Director of Investor Relations","Good morning, and thanks for joining us this morning.","Last night an updated presentation was posted to our website. We will be referring to this presentation during our call today. As a reminder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we will discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business.","Today's prepared remarks will begin with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling activities and results from John Lambuth, VP of Exploration. And then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on our operations, including production and well costs. Cimarex CFO Mark Burford is also present to help answer any questions you might have.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Karen.","And thanks to everyone who's participating in today's conference. We appreciate your interest in Cimarex.","We have some exciting new results to report to you for investments made earlier this year, including the completion of our first two-mile lateral in the Meramec. This well, the Clayton, had a peak 30-day IP over 16 million cubic feet equivalent, which is a 72% uplift versus the average one-mile lateral in Meramec we've drilled to date. Cimarex also completed its second two-mile lateral in the Wolfcamp A in Culberson County. That well, the Cavalcade, looks to be one of the best wells drilled in the Culberson Wolfcamp A to date. In addition, our production group has done an excellent job on both existing production and bringing on new wells, wells which continue outperforming our expectation. These two factors combined led to another production beat.","To begin with, however, I want to start with some conclusions. I'd like to begin the call by outlining a few key takeaways that we hope you glean from this morning's call. First, our production beat is a result of significant and meaningful improvements in our well performance, and increased focus on our base production, and an emphasis on operational excellence. Joe and John will give additional details on these operational improvements.","Second, we hear lots of talk lately that the industry focus is no longer on growth for growth's sake. This is heartening since we've been saying this for 20 years. Cimarex has also maintained an unrelenting focus on return on invested capital. To that end, we do not have an overarching strategic preference on commodity type. We drill the wells that offer the best full cycle returns. We model our investments using realized prices with room for draconian downside. Our production mix will shift between gas and oil depending upon our well mix and the returns we find within our portfolio.","Third, Cimarex has a bias for pressured reservoirs, and pressured tight reservoirs tend to produce a commodity mix that is both oily and gassy. These reservoirs have tremendous deliverability and also contain the energy which gives longer horizontal wells a turbo charged uplift. John will discuss the results of our first long lateral in the emerging Meramec play. Don't miss the significance of this well to our acreage position and the future potential of this play to Cimarex.","Fourth, Cimarex is entering a period of significantly improved capital efficiency. You will hear lots of discussion today about upcoming development projects and pilots that involve 10,000 foot and 7,500 foot horizontal wells. These longer horizontal wells are providing great improvements to our capital efficiency, and our program is rapidly evolving to be dominated by them. Our acreage positions in both the Anadarko and Delaware Basins support a growing long lateral program. John will discuss our upcoming long horizontal well development projects in the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp A, Delaware Basin Wolfcamp D, and the Anadarko Basin Woodford Meramec.","And fifth and finally, as we look into 2016, we see Cimarex positioned where we have told you we need to be. We've told you we need to find a sustainable path in this downturn, one where we can make a living, add value and not wait for the rescue ship. We will enter 2016 with 12 operated rigs. Owing to tremendous improvements in drilling efficiencies, completion optimization and cost reductions, we may be able to accomplish with 12 rigs what we had previously modeled with 16.","As we look ahead, we model a program for 2016, 2017 and beyond, which is within cash flow and cash on hand and allows us to survive and prosper in this difficult environment. This has always been our goal and it is a tremendous complement to our organization and to our assets that we have found firm footing.","With that I'd like to turn the call over to John for further details.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Thanks, Tom.","I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on upcoming activities. Cimarex invested $184 million during the third quarter drilling and completing wells. About 60% was invested in the Permian region with the rest of that money going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. Companywide we brought 56 gross, 14 net wells on production during the quarter.","Our Permian operations are in Delaware Basin, where we brought on 4 of the 14 net wells during the third quarter. All were Wolfcamp wells. Our long lateral program in the Wolfcamp D in Culberson County continues to provide solid results. We now have 30-day peak IP rates averaging 2,308 barrels of oil per day from 13 Wolfcamp D long lateral wells. As always, we continue to work on optimizing our frac designs. We have had great success in lowering drilling days along laterals meaning individual rigs can accomplish more than previously thought. Joe will talk more about those details shortly.","On our last call we talked about our plans to spud our first Wolfcamp A down spacing pilot in Culberson County. Locations are being built and drilling is expected to be underway this quarter. This six well pilot will be drilled using 7,500 foot laterals and will test two different spacing designs. Half of the wells will test eight wells per section spacing while the other half will test six wells per section. Both will be drilled in a staggered pattern.","Regarding our plans to begin development drilling in the Wolfcamp D in Culberson, we have adjusted our plans from what we discussed on the last call in that we will now drill five new 10,000 foot laterals stack staggered in the Wolfcamp D on the two adjoining sections immediately east of our two spacing pilot sections. This change will insure the accuracy of the production data since unlike the original planned sections, there'll be no parent wells embedded within these development wells. Plus the added benefit that we expect to achieve very good A-tax rate of return for these 10,000 foot wells, even in this challenging commodity environment. Drilling will commence in the first quarter of 2016 with production scheduled to begin mid-year.","Now on to the Mid-continent, you will recall that we began drilling on the Cana-Woodford row 4 infill development program late last year. Completion on these 57 gross wells covering seven sections are nearly finished and production has begun. We will be moving drilling operations to another Woodford row infill on the east side of the core. This development covers six sections. Cimarex will operate the westernmost two sections, drilling 14 gross wells. The entire row project consists of 50 gross, 23 net wells. Production from this east Cana development row is expected to come online in July of 2016.","And in our emerging Meramec play, we now have production data on 11 5,000-foot laterals. These wells have an average 30-day peak IP rate of 9.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day, with oil yields that vary from 15 barrels per million cubic feet to 330 barrels per million cubic feet. Our first 10,000-foot lateral in the Meramec has been on production for about two-and-a-half months. The Clayton 1HX has an average 30-day peak IP of 16 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which is a 72% uplift from the average of 11 5,000 foot laterals we've drilled.","We have another Meramec long-lateral producing now, with a third currently drilling. We are very encouraged from the early time production we are seeing from this second long lateral. So much so, that going forward we plan to drill long lateral wells on all of our delineated Meramec acreage wherever possible.","As we think about the future developments at Meramec, Cimarex is focused on an area we call 14-10 (10:07). This area is made up of 30 contiguous sections that have the potential to be developed in both the Woodford and Meramec using 10,000-foot laterals. It's a big area. To better understand the multi-zone potential for this area, we have designed a down spacing pilot which we have commenced drilling on. See slide 21 for an illustration of the design.","This pilot will consist of 11 wells to be stacked and staggered in both the Meramec and Woodford formations. The pilot will be executed using 5,000-foot laterals on a little over half of one section. The spacing in the Meramec will be the equivalent of 10 wells per section, of which there will be five wells in the upper and five in the lower, staggered within the Meramec.","The Woodford will be drilled with our standard nine wells per section development plan. In addition to this pilot, we have started filling back a two-well stack staggered pilot in the Meramec and our partner has commenced drilling on a Meramec spacing pilot testing five wells per section and one landing zone. The data from these pilots will be critical in helping us design the appropriate development plan for this vast Meramec and Woodford resource.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","Well thank you, John, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'll be touching on the usual items. Our third quarter production, our Q4 and full year production outlook and then I'll finish up with a few comments on LOE and where we're seeing service costs.","We had another great quarter in Q3. Our total company net equivalent volume came in at 978.9 million a day. That's up 4% from the 942 million a day we produced in Q3 2014 and it beat our guidance of 920 million to 940 million a day by a fair margin. As Tom mentioned, and as was the case last quarter, our guidance beat once again comes as a result of stronger than expected new well performance and our production group's focus on minimizing downtime and optimizing production, with us seeing particularly exceptional results coming from the Permian.","As we have mentioned in our last few calls, our 2015 production growth was forecasted to come from the Permian in the early part of the year and then from the mid-continent in the latter part of the year and we're seeing just that. Our Q3 2015 Permian equivalent production came in at 562 million a day, up 38% from Q3 2014, while our Mid-Continent production came in at 405 million a day, down as anticipated from the 518 million a day we produced in Q3 2014. Our Cana Row 4 completion activity, as John mentioned, began in late Q3 and is forecasted to arrest the drop, providing us with a very strong boost in production as we finish off the year.","As expected, our Permian completion activity slowed during Q3, with only four net wells coming online during the quarter as compared to 30 in Q1 and 18 in Q2. As a result, our Permian net equivalent volumes declined during the quarter, down 5% as compared to Q2. That said, the Permian continues to make up the lion's share of our production, representing 57% of our total company equivalent volume and 85% of our total company oil volume.","Our Q3 Mid-Continent production came in as forecasted at 405 million a day, down slightly from the 419 million a day we posted in Q2. We're on track with our plan, projecting the Mid-Continent production to wrap up considerably here in Q4 as our Cana completion activity picks up steam. With the activity, we're projecting 21 net Mid-Continent wells to come online in Q4 versus a total of 19 for the first nine months of the year.","As we look forward into Q4, our Q4 guidance of 0.98 Bcfe to 1.01 Bcfe per day incorporates our forecasted ramp up of production from Cana, coupled with a slight drop in Permian production with our most recent slowdown in Permian completions. Our Q4 2015 guidance reflects an exit rate that's 3% to 6% above our Q4 2014 average of 915 million a day, and it provides us with a great springboard into 2016.","With our strong year-to-date results, we've once again upped our 2015 full year guidance, incorporating our Q4 projection. Our 2015 total company net equivalent production is now projected to be in the range of 983 million to 991 million a day, up from our previous guidance of 960 million to 980 million, and reflecting a 13% to 14% growth over 2014.","Shifting over to OpEx, as Tom mentioned, our production group continues to focus on trimming our operating costs. With their efforts we've seen sizable reductions and optimizations in items such as saltwater disposal, compression, rentals, power, fuel, as well as well service costs. As a result, our Q3 lifting costs came in at $0.70 per Mcfe, well below our guidance of $0.90 to $1.05, flat with our Q2 2015 average of $0.76, and down $0.29 or 29% from our 2014 average of $1.08. When incorporating our forecasted production by region and the variable nature of workover expenses, we're guiding our Q4 lifting costs to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.87 per Mcfe, down from the $0.90 to $1.05 estimate that we quoted last call.","The important byproduct of our LOE reduction is the additional funding we're supplying our drilling program. Our Q3 2015 average monthly LOE of $23.1 million per month is $6.6 million per month below our Q3 2014 average of $29.7 million a month, which over a 12-month time period equates to us bringing up about $79 million that we can direct towards our drilling program, truly significant.","On service costs, with the continued industry slowdown, the markets for both our drilling and completion costs remain relatively soft and in check. Since our last call, most of our drilling costs components have remained relatively flat with us seeing some modest decreases in a few items, such as cementing, well tubing and surface rentals, particularly in the Permian. Day rates for idle rigs continue to be very competitive, down significantly from last year's rates of $26,000 to $27,000 a day to current quoted levels that are in a range of $17,000 to $18,000 per day.","On the completion side after the first signs of cost relief in Q1, our average total company per well frac cost came down approximately 15% to 20% from Q4 with us pumping an average of about 12% more fluid and 20% more sand. As we've worked our way through Q3, we've capitalized on the continued reductions in frac cost by keeping our average well frac cost in check, while pumping even bigger jobs. As a result, our average total company Q3 frac cost is still down the same 15% to 20% from late last year but we're pumping 65% more fluid and 84% more sand on the average than we did late last year. The bottom line is we're seeing a slight drop in our major program total well costs since last quarter while continuing to pump even bigger jobs, with our total well costs down anywhere from 15% to 20% from where they were at the end of last year.","Our current Cana core one mile lateral Woodford AFE is running in the range of $6.6 million to $7 million. That's down about $100,000 from our last call and down 16% to 17% from the $7.9 million to $8.4 million quote that we gave you last year. In the Meramec, with it still early in the program, we expect to see our current single well lateral wells fall closer to the lower end at the $7 million to $7.4 million AFE range that we quoted last call, which is down about 13% from late Q4.","In the Permian project drilling continues to be our primary focus. With more wells under our belt, we've cut our Wolfcamp two-mile lateral spud to rig release time 20% from 35 days in 2014 to 28 days in 2015 and have a record well this quarter that came in at 20.5 days. We have seen similar drill time reductions in our one-mile lateral Bone Spring Avalon category of wells, cutting the average days from spud to rig release 26% from 23 days in 2014 to 17 days during the last quarter, again with a record well of a very respective 9.25 days. We've established good momentum, cutting the drilling days in our entire Permian program, and as such, we're getting more done with fewer rigs. With continued gains in drilling efficiencies and market cost reductions, we've dropped our two-mile lateral Culberson AFEs down about $200,000 with current AFE estimates of $10.8 to $11.6 million. That's down 18% from late last year.","So in closing, another great quarter's under our belt. Strong year-to-date performance resulted in yet another quarter with a good production beat. We've made significant strides to cut our LOE. Our drilling program continues to churn out very positive results. And we remain vigilant to keep our costs in check and optimize our program results.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Drew.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","It looks like you have two objectives with the 2016 program, one being to maximize capital efficiency and the other one to size up the resource base. So I'm hoping you can shed some light on how you balance innovation or pushing the envelope on well performance on one hand and minimizing costs on the other. And I guess as it relates to the pilots you plan to drill, how much variation in well design do you expect to implement?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Drew. This is Tom. That's a great question. You know certainly capital efficiency and return on capital remains our top focus. But you always have to have room for innovation. In particular, our assets are in wonderful areas where we have a very thick stratigraphic column. And understanding and identifying the full extent of that column and how many ultimate targets we're going to have is critical to full cycle development.","I would say first order is looking at the stratigraphic section and understanding how many unique landing zones you'll have. And then second order is what the wells will be spaced side to side. And the challenge as we develop these resources and go into full development is making sure that we've identified all the various landing zones that will become available to us because you cannot always go back and get them later. If you don't identify all the landing zones up front, you run a serious risk of orphaning some targets that will not be available to you, either not at all or if you come back later you'll severely interrupt existing production.","So it's always a juxtaposition. And some of the pilot projects that John has outlined allow us with small sample projects to test those various landing zones to try to optimize so as we go into full development we're doing it prudently and with the decades of inventory in mine so that we don't strand resources. So it's always a tradeoff between innovation and capital efficiency.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. This is John my only follow up with that, Tom's right on point is what's nice about these projects we have outlined is we are looking for greater capital efficiencies out of these particular pilots especially the Meramec Woodford one that I described. If we're going to be looking at mean ways to reduce our per-well cost, on a per section basis and we hope to see those type of achievements with that type of pilot while also generating very good returns in testing those multiple levels. So we hope to really achieve a lot by these pilots and put us in a very good position to go forward in our development plans.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","And this is Joe. I'll just add something further to that. With these pilots we'll also be experimenting with the optimal facility design, the utilization of zipper fracs to try to optimize our completion costs to that end.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Everyone thank you for all that color. Very helpful. In the Meramec as you complete those, that first pilot, I guess, the pilot you and Devon have the two pilots, are you looking to move forward to drilling those long laterals later in 2016 or is the outcome of the pilot kind of predicated on that?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well this is John. Like we've always talked about when we look at pilots and we ask ourselves, what are we trying to learn from pilots in terms of the ultimate spacing, as Tom alluded to the different landing zones. Yes, we tend to lean towards 5,000 foot laterals for those just from a standpoint of capital investment. But as far as going forward especially in terms of holding acreage and future drilling in the Meramec especially once we understand the ultimate spacing pattern, our plans are to drill 10,000 foot laterals over the majority of our Meramec\/Woodford acreage. The nice thing is our acreage is contiguous enough that we have that ability to do that.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I'll just ask one more. Can you compare the returns in the Meramec as they look today to Culberson County Wolfcamp and Cana? Are they similar across those three?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","You know, it varies obviously; in the Meramec, as I talked about in my part of the script, there is a large variation in yield and deliverability and so there are some sweet spots I would say in the Meramec that when we look at it, especially from a standpoint of 10,000 feet, those wells come right to the top as far as the type of returns that we can generate. They compete head on with some of our best Bone Spring drilling as well as some of our best Culberson Wolfcamp long-lateral drilling. So it's very nice to have that kind of portfolio that again we can go after here.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for all the color.","Operator","The next question comes from Irene Haas with Wunderlich. Please go ahead.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Yeah, so question is, can you give me the average number of rigs that you are running during the fourth quarter? And perhaps a little insight into first quarter, are we going to just average 12 rigs for the first quarter, and then the entire year? Just trying to get a feeling of your activity levels.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah, well this is John. I think currently we have eight...","Unknown Speaker","Seven.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Seven, I think about to have an eighth rig, and certainly by December we will be at 12 rigs. That is our plan, and that will be our plan going into the first quarter of next year, is 12 rigs. Those rigs will be deployed currently with six in the Permian and six in Anadarko. And within each of those programs, within the Permian two will be Bone Spring rigs, the other four will be Culberson rigs. Well three of them will be Culberson; the fourth one will be Reeves, currently. In Anadarko it's probably more of a mix of four Woodford and two Meramec, but that will vary some during the course of the year.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","And...","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And to answer your question on the average, Irene. You can maybe call later and we can get that to you. But we'll have 12 rigs by the beginning of the year and that's kind of where we want to enter 2016 too, we think that's a good number and gives us kind of the flexibility we want.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Are you going to stay at 12 rigs? Or would you have any ambition to get up to 16? Or you don't need to?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well we don't have any immediate plans. We certainly have the capability, but right now we'd like to stay at 12 and kind of watch and wait.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey good morning, everyone, and congrats. Tom I just wanted to come back to some of your earlier comments on returns. Can you maybe just give us some color around what you require for an investment, maybe on a full-cycle and half-cycle basis? And can you also just frame some of the draconian downsides that you highlighted?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well returns are \u2013 everybody who talks about returns, we're probably all talking about different things. You hear people talk about half-cycle, full-cycle, I will say that at the end of the day, we sum it up and we look at a fully burdened return, and that's how we grade ourselves. And that would include all land, amortized, all overhead associated with programs, any and all capital and what we book for reserves. And here at Cimarex we only look at proved, developed reserves. We don't -- you know, if we book PUDs at the end of the year we don't count that in terms of our reserve adds that goes into our returns. And so there's a lot of room for things to go wrong in that but our experience is that on a return basis, if you're good at this business, you're really good, you can get consistently mid to high teens fully burdened. Now different people may have different reads on that. That's our experience.","But things go wrong in our business. And that means if you're expecting to deliver to your shareholders mid to high teens on all investments you'd better be drilling wells that are A-tax 25% or better. And it just so happens when you sum up a program that's A-tax 25% or better, if you're good you may end up having fully burdened mid-teens. Now there's a lot of variation around that answer but that's the way we see it and that's what our experience tells us.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So within your portfolio today what would see as generating A-tax 25% or better?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, certainly I would say just about everything we're drilling. With very few exceptions we won't get below that unless it's some extraordinary piece of information we think we can leverage for the future. And you also asked about our downside. We're currently running our investments at a $30-flat NYMEX oil held flat forever, at $40-flat NYMEX held flat forever, and $2 and $2.50 gas held flat forever. And then furthermore we take the dominant revenue phase of a well and we see how low can that dominant revenue phase go and will we still get an A-tax 15% on that investment.","So we try to stress test our investment. We're not perfect at it and there's certainly an ongoing debate here at Cimarex as to how we should be looking at it. But we tend to live in a world where things don't always work as we planned and want to leave ourselves some room for that.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. I appreciate that answer. And maybe just on 2016. So I guess from your comments, sticking with 12 rigs instead of 16 is more due to efficiency than anything else? And you've previously mentioned that you want to spend the proceeds from the equity deal earlier this year next year. Are you still thinking that way? Or are you comfortable maybe preserving some of those proceeds into 2017 at this point?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well, this is John. I'll take the first part of your question. Maybe Mark will follow up. Based on our comments earlier, especially what Joe talked about in terms of how quick we're drilling these wells, when we look at our programs now when we run up to 12 rigs, we come pretty close to spending the amount of capital that we envisioned spending in 2016 when we originally looked at it from 16 rigs. I mean, we are really drilling these wells fast. And so it just means we get more done with less rigs. We're still looking at a certain capital model but we're just more efficient with it. Mark?","G. Mark Burford - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah. Just to follow up on that Jason and also you might have seen in the pie charts that our mix of drilling in 2016 is slightly shifting, a bit more Bone Spring and Meramec in that mix of drilling. As John alluded to the net number of wells we can cause through 12 rigs with that shift in mix of drilling is not that dissimilar to what we're running with 16 rigs. Capital is down with just a little bit less long laterals in that mix of wells -- so capital would be probably -- efficiency of drilling time and also just overall well costs currently at least capital will be down probably with where we had it, 16 (32:33) but number of net wells we're looking to get done is pretty comparable.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll just finish up. Jason, when we did our equity offering and we first talked about 16 rigs we were in a -- what looks to us today as a significantly higher commodity environment. We were at $60, $65 oil and looking at that as a go forward we've slipped quite a bit. Now balancing that slip has been increasing well performance, increasing drilling efficiencies. So we're pretty pleased with where we sit today from a return landscape, but we think it's prudent to be talking about the rig activity. We are, we maintain that flexibility and we hope that our Cimarex shareholders are listening will be glad that we're proceeding cautiously but moving ahead.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the detail, everyone. Thanks.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Please go ahead.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks. I appreciate the time. I guess first, just wanted to talk a little bit more about the Meramec and as you've continued to work through the delineation program there. How much of your acreage in the Meramec, with Meramec exposure do you believe will have multiple landing zones within the Meramec ultimately? Is it the whole slug? Or is there a particular portion?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","The whole slug. This is John. We don't know yet honestly we don't know. I mean, it's a pretty thick section and so we haven't written off any of our areas I don't think yet where we think we can only do one landing zone. We just don't know. Time will tell and it's going to take more drilling by us, as well as our competitors. I will say that we do continue to experiment with different landing zones. We traditionally drill most of our wells in what we call the middle Meramec. We have some more recent wells we've done in the lower Meramec and we've been very pleased with what we see there. So it's hard to say right now because we're just so early in the game. So yeah, I hope it's the whole slug but we'll see.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is Tom. One of the things I would add to that is we're almost internally talking about the Mississippian section more than the Meramec. We certainly have the Osage that sits underneath the Meramec and there's a reasonable suspicion that there's lots of areas where that's contributing significantly. And then we also look at the Mississippian Woodford as one continuous petroleum system. So I think for a lot of our acreage we're going to easily say that we're going to have three different landing zones in that petroleum system. That would include the Meramec, Osage and Woodford. But John's right we're still delineating that and right now it's premature to give you an acreage count but it's a lot of our asset.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. Fair enough. Is it safe to say that whole 14-10 (35:43) area that you highlighted would all be prospective by you're thinking currently for multi-zone development side of it?","\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. We're evolving here and we'll give you more color on that project as we get our plans further defined. But when you talk about an area the size that John talked about, essentially all of its Cimarex operated. We can drill 10,000 full length horizontal wells with three landing zones. It's a big, big project. You don't have to go back very many years to where this project swamps the size of Cimarex in terms of what it does. So it's worthy of a lot of forethought and we're putting a lot of thought into it and how do we develop it in the smartest way.\nMichael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors\nOkay. Yeah. That's helpful and you guys alluded to it earlier but did notice that the Meramec's getting a good amount more of the 2016 pie versus the original plan from last quarter. How much more I guess could that, I mean, it does seem like if those wells continue to perform as they are as a highly efficient piece of the capital program. How much more of that pie would you say that the Meramec could command if things continue to play out as they are?\nJohn Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration\nWell this is John. I think in some ways that reflection of the pie shape you're seeing is first and foremost a recognition that we do have some acreage we have to go out there and hold. I'm proud of the fact that early on in this play once we had a few wells under our belt, we did get out and pick up a nice block of acreage but that acreage has termed. And so part of that capital you see is us getting out there and insuring that we hold that acreage position.\nBut I'll also say and true to our word, we chase returns and as we continue to drill these long laterals and if we continue to see good type of returns, then yeah. I mean, we're going to take a hard look at that and make a decision as we always do. We like to maintain our flexibility in that regard, but again, the main reason you're seeing that additional capital is primarily to hold acreage for us this year.\nMichael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors\nOkay. Great. And then I guess last one on my end. Just looking through all the slides and listening to commentary, it sounds like quite a bit of the completion activity is around midyear and in second half in 2016. I guess how should I -- how should we think about the first half from a production profile standpoint? Is there much in the way of completion activity? Does it all kind of keep sequential momentum going? Or should we expect some sort of lull in that period?\nG. Mark Burford - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President\nYeah. Michael, this is Mark. And even though the plans have not been established completely for 2016 is still in motion, but your logic is correct. As some of these plays that we're moving into or some of these areas that are in field development should take a good portion of the first part of the year to drill when we start completing. That's still the case as we look into 2016. So that's a logical thought process through 2016.\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nEarly models would tell us the production growth occurs in the latter half.\nMichael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors\nOkay. Makes sense. Appreciate it. Thanks. Congrats.\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Michael.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Brian Gamble with Simmons. Please go ahead.\nBrian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International\nMorning, everybody. Appreciate all the detail. Congrats on the Meramec. The question I wanted to touch on, Tom, was I guess specifically on the Mid-Con, successful results, definitely working through optimal spacing, optimal visioning of the way you want to go forward. Has it changed your attitude at all to any particular additional set of acreage? Anything you're seeing either within distressed assets or just within your results that lead you to believe the trend might be going in a certain direction that might enhance an M&A opportunity in that area?\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nWell, that's a great question. This is Tom. We would love to find assets in our core areas that are at reasonable valuations and are bolt-on, either extensions or even the ability to drill 10,000 foot laterals because they're adjacent to our existing position. That would be a wonderful thing. As you know, the Meramec is not a secret. There are a couple of really aggressive private equity players out there, there are public companies that are extremely aggressive and there are new entrants every time we turn around. So valuations out here are pretty challenging when you look at per acre costs.\nThere was a regional BIA sale that you're probably aware of, that was two or three weeks ago? And what we bid one, what did we win one track, John?\nJohn Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration\nWe got one track, yes. Thanks for reminding me, Tom.\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nThere was, even the private equity players were standing there stunned because of the valuations. So it's, we're, we would love to add assets either through M&A or acreage bolt-ons, but we have to be disciplined. We just have to be disciplined.\nBrian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International\nWith that discipline in mind, is there any particular area that would be outside your core areas? Outside the Permian and the Mid-Con that could potentially gets interesting the longer we stay at these lower prices? Clearly there are some guys with much worse balance sheets than you guys who may be more incentivized to do something?\nJohn Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration\nThis is John. I guess I'll take a stab at that. I mean we have a group that is constantly looking at new opportunities for us outside of our two core areas. And we're always looking at different basins that we think would be a good fit for us. But it always comes down to what can we bring that's different than what they already have? I mean it's one thing that they may have an impaired balance sheet, it's another to say whether or not they're a poor operator or, what could we do differently? So we look at that, for sure. But that's a tough challenge for us, because again you're talking about bringing in something that would have to compete with the type of assets we already have under our belt in both the Permian and Anadarko.\nSo it's a pretty high threshold for us to get interested in something outside of those two basins, just given the large inventory of opportunity we already have. But we do look. We're not -- we are always looking because we're always chasing the best return. And if we think there is a better return somewhere else, then yeah, we'll go after it. But boy, it would be tough.\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nWe always have an active search ongoing, either for assets or M&A. Not a week goes by where we don't have several meaningful discussions on opportunities. But, as John said, the bar is high.\nBrian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International\nAnd then just one short-term question, the Q4 completion schedule, how many Permian wells are on it?\nJoseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP\nFor Q4, this is Joe. On a net basis we're looking at about 11.7 net wells in the Permian and about 20.8 in the Mid-Continent.\nBrian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International\nPerfect. Thanks, guys.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nJeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nHi. Good morning, everyone.\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nJeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nHi. You talked about trying to identify landing zones early to make sure that you don't go and orphan any zones. And can you talk about that a little bit in regards to the Wolfcamp C, because it looks like from the presentation the Culberson Wolfcamp C development dropped off in exchange for the longer laterals in the Wolfcamp D. And then also in the Meramec and the Woodford, in terms of co-development you talked about how thick the sections are but what would you need to see to be confident that you can continue with the Woodford development and then maybe come back later and catch the Meramec over time?\nJohn Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration\nWell, this is John. First off, we have not given up on the C. I want to be clear about that. What we've elected to do is in this case we are going to go develop the D on those two sections. Really what we're doing is we want the see the effect of a stagger on those wells within the fifth D (44:47). And we want to get that result because that's not something we've achieved yet with our other two pilots. I will tell you that we have plans after we finish with those long laterals to go right back up north to what we had previously talked about as our C hero assault (45:04). And there's a good chance that based on what we see from this latest development area that we'll then layer in the C wells. Right now it's just one step at a time. Right now we really want to see the effect of stagger and we don't want to overcomplicate it in this case.\nAs far as the Woodford, Meramec and I guess what we tend to call optionality, that is can you develop Woodford and then come back later and develop Meramec? Those are things that quite frankly we're trying to ascertain right now with some of the wells that we've been drilling. I don't know that we have a firm answer on that just yet as far as can we do one and come back and do another later, or do we have to do it all simultaneously? I can tell you that's a big debate within our company and that's something that we have a number of wells that have been drilled or will be drilled that will be testing those type of concepts. Because that is something that we have to understand as we go forward.\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nJeanine, it's Tom. If we had to take a risk on that I would say our bias would be to drill the Meramec first and come in later and get the Woodford underneath it rather than the other way around. And that's just, the Woodford and the Meramec behave very differently when you offset them. But John's right, we don't know the answer to that yet. One thing we do know, if we codevelop it all simultaneously then we don't really have to spend a lot of time worrying about this.\nJeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nOkay. Great. That's really helpful. And then in terms of the production profile for 2016, dovetailing on our previous question, it looks like that for the Permian the approach for completions there for next year is just drill all the wells and then complete all the wells at the same time, which I think is what you're doing in the Mid-Con, and I assume that has something to do with the reservoir characteristics in the Mid-Con. Is there anything in the data that suggests that you need to absolutely do that same type of development approach in the Wolfcamp? So is it at all possible that you could do a less chunky program and kind of smooth out production for next year?\nJohn Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration\nThis is John. Yes, there are areas within the Wolfcamp where I think we have satisfied ourselves that we could be less chunky in our development, and that is, maybe take a section at a time. But honestly, from a capital efficiency standpoint I don't know that's in our best interest in terms of planning out all the infrastructure involved in this. I think from our standpoint it is best to look at it more in multi-section development, if we're really going to achieve those future capital reductions we'd like to see on a per well basis. So honestly I think that's just where the whole industry's going, that you're going to see a lot more of these larger scale developments. And that's going to lead to a more chunkier type of production profile.\nJeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nOkay. Great. Thanks very much.\nKaren Acierno - Director of Investor Relations\nYou know, Jeanine, supplementing the infills we'll have rigs running in the Bone Spring. So those rigs add production on a more regular basis. So it's not as if all the production will be coming on that way.\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nAnd Meramec. We may have individual Meramec elimination (48:11).\nJeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBiju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on the Bone Spring program. I'm looking at slide 15. You talk about 100 locations identified. And I suppose that's mostly in New Mexico. And I was wondering what is your view of the acreage down in Culberson County? And what could be the Bone Spring potential there?\nJohn Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration\nYeah. This is John. We love our Bone Spring acreage in Culberson. As you can tell, we've drilled quite a few wells there. And in fact, of the two rigs that will be drilling Bone Spring that we anticipate in 2016, one of those rigs pretty much will be drilling down in that Culberson area. There is great potential still there. I know we always sound like a broken record when it comes to the Bone Spring. You know we don't think of it as a regional resource play like a shale. For the Culberson acreage it just takes more drilling on our part to get more confident and de-risking on more of the acreage. So yeah, there's still plenty of locations left in Culberson. And there's still a lot of upside left down there. But we still need to explore some of that.\nBiju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nOkay. So that will be as locations added as you go delineate that acreage block?\nJohn Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration\nYeah. We basically kind of step out from section to section. The issue with Bone Spring is pretty simple. It's water cut and we have to be very careful on water cut and that's really what drives our economics. And so as we get better and better definitional on the water cut and within our plays, then that helps us define better where all the good locations are. And that's something we're still defining and understanding better down in Culberson.\nBiju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nGot it. Thanks.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nThomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\nI want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and we look forward to delivering further results in the future. Thank you all very much.\nOperator\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"5459":["Cimarex Energy Co.

Last night, we updated \u2013 we posted an updated presentation on our website. We'll be referring to this presentation during our call today if you'd like to take a look at it. And as a reminder, our discussions will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business.","So today's prepared remarks will begin with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling results and activities from John Lambuth, VP of Exploration; and finally Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on our operations including production and well costs. Paul Korus and Mark Burford are also here in the room to help answer any questions.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Karen, and thanks to everyone who's participating in today's conference. We appreciate your interest in Cimarex. I'd like to take a few minutes to share my thoughts on the current environment before turning it over to John and Joe for the details of our first quarter results and our plans for the rest of 2015.","During this call, you'll hear about new wells that are outperforming our expectations, which has led to our Q1 production beat. We have several new long laterals in the Delaware Basin that are in the Wolfcamp on line and they've reaffirmed our enthusiasm for the long-term potential of this play for Cimarex. Our improved well performance is primarily driven by ongoing well optimization, but is also driven by certain changes in our horizontal landing zone. You'll also hear some of the results from our second Bone Spring oil play in our Eddy County, White City acreage. These wells are among the best in our portfolio with multi-year running room.","We've always been a company that emphasizes the science and that emphasis is yielding results in spacing pilots, well design, completion design and unraveling geologic complexity. We will also update you on our continued success in the Cana-Woodford shale and the emerging Meramec plays.","Oil prices have recovered modestly since our last call, but are still at a level that we view as unsustainable. Natural gas prices remain depressed. Our projected 2015 cash flow outlook is similar to what it was at our last quarter call in February. Owing to our commitments to be fiscally disciplined, our 2015 capital expansions remain at the $900 million to $1.1 billion that we've previously announced. We have seen service costs decrease 15% below Q4 levels and we look forward to further service cost reductions.","For now, we intend to leave within cash flow and not incur additional debt during the remainder of 2015. We view debt as a long-term commitment and we're hesitant to make long-term commitments in this volatile environment. Our focus has been on asset quality. As we have high graded our activity, we have continually scrubbed our project returns to ensure that we're investing wisely and not destroying capital in this depressed commodity environment.","The robustness of the returns in our portfolio has surprised us to the upside. We've a deep inventory of projects that make great sense in today's environment and when the time is right for acceleration, we're ready to roll. The quality of our inventory is a testament to technology, innovation, and great geo-science that have become hallmarks of Cimarex. There's also a splash of luck in there too; our assets are in great basins with tremendous multi-pay geologic targets.","Finally, as always, our focus is on creating shareholder value. These depressed commodity prices make our task more difficult.","(04:30 \u2013 04:41)","Operator","Pardon me. This is the operator. Please continue to hold the line. We are attempting to reestablish connection. Again, please continue to hold the line.","(04:47 \u2013 07:23)","Operator","This is the operator. Once again, please continue to hold the line. The speakers will reconnect shortly. Thank you.","(07:28 \u2013 08:08)","Operator","Pardon me. This is the operator; I have reconnected to speaker's location.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I thank you for your patience. Apparently our emphasis on technology does not include telephone technology, but I'm not sure where we got cut off; but I was just saying that oil prices have recovered modestly and we're so committed to the $900 million to $1.1 billion that we previously announced for 2015 CapEx.","And also, I think I it was fading when I was telling you that we've seen service costs come down 15% since the fourth quarter and we're expecting further service cost reductions but we intend to remain within cash flow for the remainder of 2015, and that's based on our core hesitation to incur addition debt in this volatile environment.","Our focus has been on asset quality, and as we've managed through this price correction, we've continually scrubbed our returns and looked to make sure that we are funding the very best projects and that we are not destroying capital. And as we've done that, the robustness in quality of our well level returns have surprised us to the upside.","We've got a great inventory of projects. We have lots to do in current environment, and when the time is right for us to accelerate, we'll be ready and we got lots teed up. And as I was saying, the quality of this inventory is really a testament to our organization, our emphasis on technology and innovation, and great geoscience; and it's nice to have a little luck as well. Our assets are in great basins; they're multi-pay basins that really allow us to leverage technology and play against our core strengths.","And finally, as always, our focus is on creating shareholder value. These depressed commodity prices make our task more difficult while but are uncompromising on our focus on shareholder value. We have the organization and the assets to emerge from this down-cycle stronger than ever.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John Lambuth who'll provide additional detail.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics about some of our latest results.","Cimarex invested $308 million during the first quarter drilling and completing wells. 67% of that investment was in the Permian region with the rest going toward activities in Mid-Continent region. Companywide, we brought 53 gross, 33 net wells on production during the quarter. Our Permian operations are in the Delaware Basin where we completed 30 of those 33 net wells during the first quarter. We focused on completing our backlog of Avalon wells and Wolfcamp long laterals. We also began production on several new second Bone Spring wells located in our White City area.","We continue to have exceptional results drilling second Bone Spring wells in this area since incorporating larger frac jobs into our completion design. We've gone from 9 stages to 15 stages in order to achieve these results. We now have 15 wells with 30-day peak averages of 1,344 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Oil represents 68% of the production stream on a three stream basis with the 15 wells averaging just over 900 barrels per day for 30 days. As of today, we have identified approximately 100 second Bone Spring locations on our White City acreage with the vast majority being located on acreage which is held by production.","Our long lateral program in the Wolfcamp D in Culberson County continues to provide solid results. Eleven long lateral wells are now producing and seven wells now have enough data to provide an updated average 30-day peak IP of 2,378 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","As I said on our last call, we continue to work on optimizing our frac design to both maximize IP rates while paying close attention to costs. In fact, we've recently brought on a number of Wolfcamp wells with various frac designs in order to determine the best design for our next spacing pilot. Based on these recent well results, we have chosen a stimulation design which places the same amount of sand per well as the previous pilot had, but we accomplished this with fewer stages. As for this pilot, which we just recently began to fracture stimulate, we are testing the equivalent of six wells per section with the wells spaced 880 feet apart. A diagram of this pilot can be found on slide 15 in our new corporate presentation. The new pilot was drilled directly south of our first Culberson down-spacing pilot, thus enabling us to be able to review well results without worrying about geologic variation.","Also in the Delaware Basin, I'd like to give you an update on the status of our stack staggered Wolfcamp A pilot in Reeves County. This pilot was designed to test the down-spacing and the viability of landing more than one lateral in the fifth Wolfcamp A section.","After delays caused by the September flooding, these wells began producing in early December. I'll refer you to slide 18 in our presentation for a diagram of the pilot. The wells landed in the upper part of the Wolfcamp A produced at higher rates than the lower wells, achieving a peak 30-day average of 1,068 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 59% was oil. The wells in the Lower A had a peak 30-day average rate of 761 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 56 barrels of that being oil.","Slide 19 shows the production of the upper and lower wells for the first four months. We had a very difficult time placing sand in the wells landed in the lower A, which we attribute to a poor choice of landing zone, which led to a higher amount of carbonate instead of shale in the lateral. We have reviewed the landing zone in question and are confident with a small landing zone adjustment we can achieve much better results in future wells landed in the lower part of the A.","In 2015, our Wolfcamp capital will continue to be focused on drilling additional long lateral wells in Culberson County as well as meeting our leasehold obligations in Reeves County, which we expect can be fulfilled by spudding eight wells in 2015 at a cost of $70 million.","Now on to the Mid-Continent; we brought three net wells on production in Mid-Continent region in the first quarter. The rest of the wells drilled are awaiting completion. You may recall that we began drilling on the Cana-Woodford Row 4 infill development program late last year. We and our partner are nearly finished with the drilling on this row and expect to begin completions around mid-summer.","To help ensure we use the most effective fracture stimulation on Row 4 wells, we recently completed and are currently flowing back eight wells in the Haley section. We varied our completions on these wells with changes in total sand pump ranging from 9 million pounds to 12 million pounds or, same way of saying it, 1,800 pounds per foot to 2,400 pounds per foot, as well as varying stage count from 24 to up to 30. We will monitor these well results and then choose the appropriate frac design for Row 4 wells.","In our emerging Meramec play, we now have enough production data on seven 5,000 foot laterals to give you an average 30-day peak IP rate of 10 million cubic feet equivalent per day. The seventh well, the Peoples 1-29H, had an average 30-day peak IP of 9.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 1,628 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This well has a very high oil yield averaging 788 barrels of oil per day. We will watch the performance of all the wells drilled to date as we continue to delineate our position, refine our geologic model, and further enhance our frac design.","We currently have two Meramec wells flowing back with a third being completed right now. We have also recently commenced drilling the first of several 10,000 foot laterals in the Meramec. Results from the long laterals shouldn't be expected before our third quarter call in November.","Cimarex has approximately 115,000 acres prospective for the Meramec, 70,000 of which have been de-risked by our and competitor drilling activity. From a capital standpoint, current plans are to invest $70 million in Meramec drilling in 2015. Once we have finished Row 4 drilling, one of the rigs that is currently working the Mid-Continent will be redeployed to the Permian Basin, bringing our rig count to three in each region.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","Thank you, John. And thank you all of you for joining our call today and especially for bearing with us during our little phone technicality there; and hopefully things are working well and it sounds like they are at least with the phone, for the call. I'll touch on the usual items, our first quarter production, update you on our second quarter and full year production outlook, and then I'll follow up with a few words on operating and service costs.","We had another great quarter for production. Despite expected shut-ins of approximately $30 million a day for January weather and February pipeline and facility maintenance in the Permian, our first quarter net equivalent daily production came in at 947 MMcfe a day; that was virtually flat to our record company production level that we posted last quarter. We were up 28% from a year ago and we beat our guidance of 920 MMcfe to 940 MMcfe a day, so a strong quarter from that perspective.","Really guided by our strong 2014 exit rate; and with that, our Q1 2015 total company reported volume was up 206 MMcfe a day from a year ago with our Permian equivalent production up $141 million a day or 41% from Q1 2014. And our Mid-Continent production up 73 MMcfe a day or 20% from last year, both statistics reflecting our strong activity levels in each of those areas over the last year.","As we mentioned last call with our \u2013 with the \u2013 excuse me, the geographic focus of our drilling program and the shifting of rigs as we moved into the year, we forecasted our early 2015 production growth to come primarily from the Permian and we saw just that in Q1. Despite freezing and pipeline maintenance issues, our first quarter Permian equivalent volume of 488 MMcfe a day was up 42 MMcfe a day or 9% from fourth quarter. Oil production drove the increase with our Q4 Permian oil volume of 43,089 barrels a day \u2013 excuse me, our Q1 Permian oil volume of 43,089 barrels a day up 13% or 4,843 barrels a day over Q4. With that, the Permian now makes up 52% of our total company equivalent production and 84% of the net oil we produce as a company.","As we mentioned during our last call, that with fewer net Mid-Continent completions planned for the first half of the year, we projected our Mid-Continent volumes to drop somewhat through mid Q3 of this year. Our Q1 Mid-Continent production came in accordingly at 444 MMcfe a day, down slightly from the 488 MMcfe a day that we posted in Q4, yet still up 20% from the 371 MMcfe a day that we posted a year ago. Nothing has changed at our modeling, where we project our Mid-Continent production to pick up in the second half this year as we bring on our Cana infill (20:03) project. We completed 3.1 net wells in the Mid-Continent in Q1; we anticipate a similar number here in Q2, and then are projecting a rapid increase to 30 net wells to be completed during the second half of the year.","So looking forward, with strong Permian results, we're really off to a good start here in Q1. Our current model projects 2015 total company net equivalent production to now be in the range of 920 MMcfe to a day to 950 MMcfe a day. That's reflecting a 6% to 9% growth over 2014, and it's up from our previous guidance of 895 MMcfe a day to 935 MMcfe a day. As was the case in our beginning year model, our current projection reflects a geographic focus to our activity, with the Permian driving production during the first half of the year and our Cana infill (20:57) project providing the catalyst during the last half of the year.","Our Q2 guidance of 965 MMcfe a day to 985 MMcfe a day is up 15% to 17% from our Q2 2014 average of 839 MMcfe a day, and it reflects continued production growth in the Permian with a slight drop in our Q2 Mid-Continent production, just prior to the onset of our Cana infill completion operations, which should begin here in Q3.","With our current drilling schedule, our projected fourth quarter 2015 production rate is forecasted to be flat to down slightly to Q4 2014, but as we've mentioned before and Tom alluded to earlier in the call, our forecasts are based on the low end of our capital spending projection and any changes in that regard will obviously effect our future forecast for production.","Shifting over to OpEx, our production team's focus on reducing LOE continues to show up in our numbers, driven by strong reductions; in items such as rentals, compression, SWD and in particular well servicing, our Q1 lifting cost came in at $0.96 an Mcfe, below the bottom end of our guidance which was $1.07 per Mcfe to $1.17 per Mcfe and down $0.09 from our Q4 average of $1.05 per Mcfe. So counting for our strong Q1, all the while the variable nature of work over expenses, we're guiding our remaining year lifting costs to be in the range of a $1 to $1.10; and again, that's down from the $1.07 to $1.17 that we quoted last call. We're extremely proud of the strides our production team has made to reduce LOE and even prouder the resolve to reduce them further yet.","A few comments on service cost. With the continued decline in industry activity, we've seen further softening in drilling and completion costs since our last call. On the drilling side, we've seen further cost reductions in items such as bits, cementing, tubulars, directional equipment; all the while day rates today are certainly more negotiable than they've been in years.","On the completion side, since about February we've seen anywhere from 10% to 40% decreases in all of our major frac cost compound, whether would be sand, transportation, chemicals, or service costs. And as a result, to give you a perspective of 30,000 feet, at the total company level, our Q1 average crude oil frac costs were down 20% from Q4. All the while, we're pumping an average of 12% more fluid and 20% more sand per job. The bottom line here is our total well costs are down 13% to 20% from where they were at the end of 2014.","Our current Cana Core one-mile lateral Woodford AFE is now in the range of $6.7 million to $7.1 million. That's down approximately 15% from the $7.98 million to $8.4 million that we quoted last year \u2013 late last year. In the Meramec, with just a handful of wells under our belts, our current single-mile lateral AFEs are running in the $7 million to $7.4 million range; that's down about 13% from late in Q4. And in the Permian, our primary focus, as John has alluded to, is in the long lateral development of our Culberson County Wolfcamp program. We've gained tremendous drilling efficiencies and cost reductions both in that program. And our current two-mile lateral Culberson's AFE for Wolfcamp are now running a $11 million to $11.8 million and that's down 17% to 20% from year end.","So we're making strides. Our LOE costs are down, our drilling costs are down, we're seeing some nice production results. We've come off a very nice quarter. Our late 2014 drilling activity has carried very strong production levels into early 2015, even into the latter parts of the second quarter. Our drilling program continues to generate positive results despite the lower commodity prices; and our organization is acting swiftly to reduce costs across the board while we're keeping a focus on optimizing program results.","So with that, I guess, I'll turn the call over to question-and-answer.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from Andrew Venker with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Drew.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, Tom. I just want to start with the Culberson density pilot; just curious aside from the spacing, are you doing anything different on the completions versus that first density pilot?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah, Drew. This is John Lambuth. As I mentioned for this particular pilot, which as I said directly located south of the first pilot we did, we are changing the frac design some based on some recent well results. We're not changing total amount of sand. We're still at around 6 million pounds over the length of a 5,000 foot lateral. But we're going to do it with fewer stages; instead of 20, we're going to do it with 16 and then what we're also doing is adding more clusters within each stage. We have a few wells that recently came on with this type of design and although we don't have a lot of production on those wells just yet, the early time data we see from those particular wells is encouraging and that's why we're making this particular change for this pilot.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And is that a cost savings measure, a capital efficiency measure, or do you really think that well design just gives you the best performance?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. Clearly, it was a decision of best performance. That said, because we're going to less stages, there will be some amount of cost savings because we haven't quantified that just yet.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","This is Joe. I'll elaborate. We've seen significant reductions in our service cost per stage, upwards of 30%, 40% per stage just over the last three months as a result of not only the market itself, but our efficiencies in pumping the jobs. So really, all those cost components are intermixed in us changing these designs, but overall we anticipate that to be down slow \u2013 somewhat from our prior jobs.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. And then, just as far as the completion design and the landing zones overall for Culberson, can you talk about how that's evolved and how much room you think there is for improvement from here? Have you played around with, I guess, the landing zone a fair amount, and where do you think you're on the completions?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well, on the landing zone front \u2013 I'll take that first. This is John again. We have a lot of wells drilled now that we've tried many different landing zones and so I think we're getting a good sense of where its best to land a well in terms of both achieving the best EUR, being able to actually place all our sand and even getting a very high drill rate through the rock. All those things come together to leading to the most economic wells. I think we're very comfortable now saying the Wolfcamp D as to where we want to be there, and I think we're definitely getting there on the Wolfcamp A from Culberson as well.","As far as the completion design, I don't know we'll ever probably reach the optimal design. Obviously, year and year-and-a-half ago, we had a major step change when we went from 10 stages to 20 stages and we are very pleased with that outcome.","In the case of Culberson Wolfcamp, we actually took it even further, going to 30 stages and we did not really get our bang for the buck doing that. And that's when we start to ask ourselves, well maybe we want a little too far on stage count and those are the things that we've been testing, as I said. These latest wells where we backed off on the stage count, but still were able to place the equivalent amount of sand just doing it with less stages but more clusters. Again, as I said, early time data is encouraging to us, but I am sure we'll find ways to even adjust that as we go along","with our future wells.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, this is Tom. I just want to comment on that. Having the two basins really makes us better, and you've heard us talk about that. We get a technology arbitrage from basin-to-basin from time-to-time. And although in 2014, we hit a major step change in our Cana-Woodford completions, we're kind of undergoing another one right now. We're trying some things in Cana that are leading to significantly better results and we are discussing what implications that may have on the Permian. So I think that this advancement in completion and well performance is still well underway and it would be, I think, foolish for us to say that we've got the right recipe in the Permian, because we're learning some things in Cana that causes us to rethink some core assumptions.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful color, Tom. Just one last one; Tom, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you would be ready to accelerate when the time is right. Can you give us any color on if there's specific criteria there that you're looking for, or is it just kind of a different feeling of the environment?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, a lot of it is feeling and that's the hardest to get specific on. I will say I think we'd like to see what happens at the OPEC meeting in June, and at least get some kind of a directional confirmation of oil prices. It's been nice to see oil prices firm up a little bit over the last couple of weeks; we'd like to see that trend continue. And every increase is a big positive to our cash flow and our outlook. So, we've said in the past that our current capital program is a snapshot in time and we'll be reevaluating that here, I think, come midsummer and make our best determination. We are absolutely getting ready to accelerate, if indeed it's prudent.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for the color, Tom.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Gamble with Simmons & Company.","Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International","I'll take a stab at the other county that you have the spacing pilots down for; maybe you could walk us through the Reeves County issues with the lowers, just \u2013 what was different on the landing zone? I'm assuming you landed in a similar spot to the parent well, but how much variability do we think that is there and just other lessons learned that may not have been part of the prepared remarks?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah, this is John Lambuth. I think what it just shows is there is a quite bit of variability in terms of the Wolfcamp in regards to these inter-bedded carbonates that we encounter from time to time. And indeed, that's what occurred with those lower wells on this particular pilot. What we didn't do, which we would do now is if we do encounter that, we will be more aggressive in our directional planes to get out of that and get back into shale, and that's something now we do do with the wells we're currently drilling. And then furthermore, we will pay more careful attention to the local well control to make sure we avoid those particular zones. That's really what it comes down to is just ensuring that you place most of that lateral in good shale because we've seen now when we do that, we're able to get our sand, our frac jobs off, and we get the best wells. And so that's really the main lesson we learned from that particular pilot on those lower wells.","Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International","And when are we going back into the lower with another similar spacing pilot? Is that something that's ongoing?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","We don't have a current spacing pilot right now lined out for Reeves. We're still looking at this one as well as our previously mentioned 80-acre Spacing Pilot and monitoring those results very carefully over time. Secondly, really, what we're doing now is doing more long laterals in Reeves. We have a quite a number of 10,000 foot laterals that are coming on now. And it's really the combination of these two different spacing pilot results along with long laterals that will help us better line out what does development look like for that particular area; so that's kind of where we're at right now.","Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International","Great. And then one bigger picture question. Tom, on the M&A market, maybe give us an update on any sort of changes in bid\/ask spread as oil prices have increased, appetite for different deals, things that maybe you've seen come across your desk. Any update there would be helpful.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. This is Tom. We really haven't seen a lot of assets recently, but I think our viewpoint is probably what's out there in the writings that there's still, I think \u2013 what did I see, a quote from CERAWeek, whistling past the graveyard; they said that our industry is whistling past the graveyard. If we get into a lower longer environment, we're expecting that bid\/ask spread to collapse a little, but we have not seen it yet.","Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International","I appreciate it, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Jason Smith of Bank of America.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jason.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Hi, Jason.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, Tom, so to follow up on the earlier acceleration question, the returns on your Culberson long laterals per your slides were, I think, about 100% at current commodity prices. So when you think about moving up from six rigs, where does the potential for hedging fit in?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, boy, I wasn't expecting this.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Well, I am wondering if you're something to protect your downside versus, if your trends are that good then...","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's a good question. I want to say first off, when we talk about our returns, they're well level returns; they're not fully burdened, I want to be clear on that. Although fully burdened, they still look very, very good. And then when you have a program, things go wrong and you have opportunity for over expenditures. So I wouldn't want to represent that our entire inventory anywhere in our program is 100% after-tax rate of return. We do have a fair amount of that, but we have a mixture of a return landscape.","But your core question is on hedging; we're discussing a different hedging approach at Cimarex. I think one of the things that philosophically appeals to us is some kind of a program hedging where we would take volumes periodically and just commit to hedge them without making a determination whether price is high or low; layer them in and kind of have a feather over time of a hedge book.","But the tough question is, all right, when you're going to start that. And I think we're kind of reluctant to layer in a lot of hedges at these price environments. We were at a dinner recently where an individual we really respect made the comment at the heels of a big discussion on hedging, he just kind of quieted the room when he said if Cimarex were to hedge today at $60 oil and prices were to recover to $90, there'd be a riot. And, you know, we maintain that balance sheet. We're fully equipped to ride through the down cycles and participate fully in the uptick. So, yeah, we're arguing about it, but I wouldn't be waiting with bated breath for some new approach.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. So then that the three rigs I think, Joe, you mentioned that the third rig is going to move back to Permian, could you just talk about where those are going to concentrate? Is it going to be all Culberson? And I guess what I'm curious about is you guys completed 16 wells in the Avalon; you said some of that was running through backlog, but obviously one of your peers this morning had some pretty positive results out of that place. So can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing there and how that fits into the portfolio going forward?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. In regard to the rigs in the Permian, the three rigs for the rest of the year, they will almost primarily be Wolfcamp wells, either in Culberson or Reeves. A lot of that is to ensure we hold our acreage; some of it is delineation as well, but that's primarily what they will be doing for the remainder of the year.","In regards to the Avalon, we did, in fact, bring on beginning of the year around 18 gross Avalon wells. Those wells were really spread across four different sections and they were essentially spacing pilot wells. We were testing both spacing and turns of 80 acres and 107 acres or the equivalent of eight or six wells a section. We also in one section stack and staggered and on another one, we even varied frac. So there's a lot going on there. All of those wells are flowing back now and really we need a little bit more time to review those results and I feel pretty confident by probably next earnings release, we'll be able to give you a good update on the result of that \u2013 of those wells in the Avalon at that time.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And just one last quick one from me, I know you guys aren't focusing there this year, but just your thoughts on the Ward County acreage and how that kind of fits in the portfolio. And maybe you can talk with any acreage exploration issues in 2015 and 2016 there that would cause you to have to drill.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. In regards to Ward County, it is a struggle. Ward County has not been a good rate of return area for us at Wolfcamp so far. And we still talk about it and we still monitor not just our own but competitor wells to make sure we fully understand that asset. We don't have any major explorations, but they really start coming in pretty big next year in 2016. We're currently looking at that acreage and asking ourselves, is there anything left that we haven't tested on it to see that we can try, but so far, within our portfolio of Wolfcamp opportunities, the Ward County is much lower prospective than the other two.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. This is Tom. One of the things we've seen in Reeves County, and I think we have a little bit of work to do in Culberson County, is so much subtle changes in landing zone are having a fairly significant impact on well performance. And we did a fair amount of (39:47) physics work and have just recently completed a couple of wells that we're optimistic will reconfirm for us what we're seeing in some competitors that landing zone makes a huge difference.","Now, is that going to save Ward County? We don't think so today, but we're looking long and hard at it and, as John said, we study our competitors' as well as our own activity. Stay tuned. I mean, there was a day when we expected Ward County to be our best and it cycled. I mean, there was a day when we looked at our entire Wolfcamp landscape and we thought that Ward County would be our best. And so it comes and goes.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answers. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Dan Guffey at Stifel.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, guys. You gave rates on your four 7,500 foot Wolfcamp A laterals and Culberson, and I'm curious if you can kind of walk through \u2013 I know they're more oil rich, but they come in \u2013 come on at lower rates. I guess, can you walk through and compare the economics versus the D? And then on top of that, how many locations have you identified and are 10,000 foot laterals feasible, across your acreage?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. This is John Lambuth. I'll take a stab at that. The Wolfcamp A wells and Culberson are definitely higher yield, higher condensate, but they do come in at a little bit lower rate and that's simply because you're a little bit less pressure than you are in the D. But that said, those lower rates are more to make up for because of the amount of oil we do make; but right now, just as I speak on a comparative basis, the Wolfcamp A laterals to us look just as good economically as do the Ds.","The first few A wells are 7,500 and that's just a matter of the way that acreage laid there in Culberson. We share that JVA with Chevron, and we just have an odd number section so at some point, not all of them could be 10,000 foot laterals so in this case, those basket of wells were 7,500. The remaining of our acreage, we fully anticipate to be 10,000 foot for A, and in fact, I think we have one of our first ones coming on here right now. So the lateral length, it's just because of the acreage itself not because we don't think we can't do 10,000 in the A and that would be our plans going forward for the A.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, on locations and how much of your acreage you think is prospective across Culberson and then does the A thin, I guess, as you move across your acreage to the north and to the west?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","As far as the A is concerned, it does begin to thin as we go toward the west and a little bit to the north. But to be honest, we haven't really determined how thin is still good. We haven't pushed that edge yet so it's hard for me to say, how much of the acreage is good for A or not. Those are some of the things we'll have to do here in the coming \u2013 with the drilling program is to test that boundary. We don't know the answer to that.","I mean, clearly, we started in an area where we had a very good thickness in the A; but again, to be honest, and it's kind of nice, there are other competitors drilling wells nearby us, testing some of these thinner intervals of the A that will go a long way to helping us to determine just how prospective is our entire acreage there in Culberson. But I don't really have an answer for you today, but stay tuned; over time, we'll be able to give more clarity as we get more wells on line.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just two follow-ups kind of defining acreage in the Avalon, just piggybacking on the last question; previously, you guys have talked about 200 plus locations. You guys are obviously doing down spacing test among the others that you listed. I guess what is your identified inventory in the Avalon at this time and I guess what base assumptions are you using to back that up?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. This is John. I think in today's commodity price and cost environment, we see around 186 gross, 5,000-foot laterals and that's, I believe, based on six wells per section. So that could change dramatically based on the spacing pilot results. But that's just how we see it today, but that number is always changing. That's just as of today, that's how we see it.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then switching gears over the Meramac, you guys have talked about 70,000 net acres you feel is de-risked and 115,000 net acres total. You guys have provided a map and you guys have mapped that geologically with significant well control across your acreage. I'm wondering how much do you feel is kind of in the up-dip \u2013 up-dip kind of normalized pressure versus the down dip over pressured regime?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. I don't remember the numbers off the top of my head. Clearly, we have a good representation of acreage both in the up-dip as well as the down-dip, but I don't recall the break \u2013 breakout of their \u2013 off the top of my head. We could probably follow-up with you on that to give you that breakdown; I just don't have it with me.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Yeah. That'd be great. Thanks for all the color today, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Investment Research.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Good morning.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I appreciate the color you just gave a few minutes ago on the Wolfcamp A and Culberson. Just kind of like to extend the idea a little bit and ask, is the prospectivity of the Wolfcamp D and the Wolfcamp A similar across \u2013 I'm looking at slide 11, across the Culberson acreage or are there different parts to the acreage that are discretely prospective for each zone?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Give me a minute while I get to slide 11. The Wolfcamp D is prospective over all of our acreage there in terms of thickness. The Wolfcamp D is much thicker. I think the only issue we have there is, of course, like in the Delaware Basin, as we go from east to west, you begin to lose your yield as you go to the west. And it just becomes a matter of economics at that point as to how far west you can go. We don't really \u2013 we haven't really defined it as of yet. But the D is a much thicker interval across the breadth of our acreage than what the A exhibits, thus, more prospectivity.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is Tom. The nice thing about this Culberson block, when we're talking about economic limits, is we have a wide open playing field for long laterals. In fact, 10,000 foot laterals, I think, will be the standard out here and that gives us tremendous range of economic liability. And that's going to be true on the A and the D. And then I also do want to discount the C. We've talked about the C not competing with D and the A. But when we go to full development, I would anticipate that the C will be developed alongside of it.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","I'll follow-up with Tom's comment. That's especially true when we look at the C on a 10,000 foot lateral basis; then it becomes more economically viable for us. And it starts to make sense that in a full development mode, while you're there you'd want to capture that interval while you're doing the D as well. And that's something we'll clearly need to be testing once we get further along and actually into development mode whenever that occurs here.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And this speaks back to our opening remarks on asset quality. When we look at our Culberson block, and that Eddy block \u2013 Eddy County block to the north of it, there you have also great Wolfcamp prospectivity and then our central Reeves acreage, all of it is nicely blocked out. So the opportunity for longer horizontal wells is pretty deep in our inventory and that allows us a lot of robustness.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","And it sounds like from what you just laid out that there's certainly going to be some potential for maybe A, C and D in some locations when you're full bed development.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","That is especially true on the eastern side of our block. And then as we move to the west we'll just \u2013 we'll have to take a wait and see based on well results. But certainly, the eastern side of Culberson definitely aligns itself up to that and with further drilling, we'll see how far we can push that full three stacked opportunity.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Although we don't have results to discuss, there's also a push for a second D landing zone. So it's too premature to even hint that we may have two zones in D, but we're testing it.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Look forward to some color on that one, when it comes out. On slide 22, you showed, by my count, six locations in the Meramec, so it looks like maybe the seventh one hadn't shown up on that slide yet. I was just wondering was the seventh completion an updip or down-dip well?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","No. This is John. I believe there are seven stars; just got to look up to the north, west or up.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Oh, there it is; yeah, so which one was the seventh?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","That was the seventh.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. So you've also tested a little bit further away from kind of the area where you've been drilling.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yes. That was a delineation up there. Yes.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then as a final question, I just wanted to go back to the lower A landing zone subject in Reeves County. I just wanted to make sure that I understood it correctly. Is it \u2013 based on the need to move the landing zone, does this affect the amount of acreage that you thought \u2013 previously thought was prospective for the lower landing zone? In other words, is this an adjustment that you can make in your \u2013 within your existing vision and prospectivity or does it change anything?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","It really doesn't change any prospectivity as far as acreage. It just means we have to be a little more careful when we drill those laterals and pay a little more careful attention to what we are in. To us, like I said, it's literally a very small adjustment to lateral zone and then very careful attention to why we are drilling that lateral, if we do encounter a carbonate to quickly adjust and get out of it.","And no, we don't see that as a hindrance at all going forward. It's just a lesson learned. A tough lesson learned, but we've learned our lesson there in regards to how we will drill those wells going forward.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great, thanks. I appreciate it. Good quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinnen Energy Advisors.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks, good morning.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Michael.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","I guess maybe one on the Mid-Con first. Just curious around what sort of discussions have you had, what's the thought process behind any additional row development with your partner in the Cana-Woodford as we think about formulating a 2016 plan.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. We have lots of discussions with our partner and there are two rows currently being discussed as future development. Potentially, even to the point we began drilling on at least one of those rows later this year. So there's still funny to do here and both us and our partner are very pleased with returns we're seeing from our development, which is leading toward the discussion I just mentioned about a couple more rows of development that potentially may begin later this year and go into next year. As we firm up those plans, then certainly we'll let you know probably by next quarter's call, we'll see. But discussions are underway about more development in the Woodford.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. And I guess maybe just high level then, thinking about just the capital cycle 2015 and 2016, is it fair to say then that 2016 might be a similar look to 2015 as it relates to Permian outperforming in the first half and the Mid-Con coming in in the second half in a stronger way? Is that...","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, this is Tom. It's really premature to get that granular with 2016. We're still wrestling with what 2015 is going to look like. So we've got lots to do, but how we stage it and what that will look like, it's way premature for that.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. That's fair. And then I guess jumping over to the Permian, can you give a little more color around the thought process on the six well spacing versus the tighter spacing on the prior pilings in Culberson and what you're hoping to learn outside of the varying completion designs from a spacing perspective?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. I'll take a stab at that. I think we all recognize that when we do go to development mode on the \u2013 in Culberson, that's a very critical step for us; lot of capital and we want to make sure we do it right. And so we knew all along that one pilot would not be sufficient to answer that question. And we kind of knew all along that we would have to do a couple pilots where we varied the spacing, in essence so we can bookend results in terms of what does six wells looks like per section versus eight. Please understand it, us going to six wells a section with this particular pilot in no way infers that that's what we think our spacing would be. It just helps us with those results and our previous pilot really hone in on what is the right spacing from a standpoint of both rate of return and PV. And that's why we are doing that, it is to kind of create those bookend results and then review that, and then make an informed decision on how to go about and develop that acreage. So that's the thought process.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","That's super helpful color. Thanks. And then just in the Permian program in 2015, how much of the program is on full two-mile laterals at this stage for rest of the year?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. All of Culberson is either 7,500 feet or 10,000 feet in regards to Wolfcamp; and in regards to Reeves, I would say the majority of the wells are 10,000 foot. There are some that are 5,000 foot just simply because we don't have the acreage to do 10,000 foot, but we're at that point even in Reeves that if the acreage allows us, then we're drilling 10,000 foot.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The one exception, the pilot we've discussed is 5,000 foot. We choose to do \u2013 to the extent we're doing science and it's an experiment, we like to go with a more cheaper well.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah. Thanks. And then last one on my end, in that Reeves pilot, the mix shifted a little bit over the course of the 90 days in the lower A. Is there anything to read into there or is that, again, somewhat a function of the carbonates encountered during drilling?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","I don't know there's a lot to read into that. Obviously, over time, these wells tend to \u2013 our GOR does go up as we produce these wells, so I think you're seeing a little bit of that there. But in the course of four months, I don't know you can read too much into those numbers just yet.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, this is Tom. You know, when we forecast these wells, we forecast the declining oil yields and that's built into our economics and we have raging debates internally as to whether we've got that forecasted correctly. I think there's some organizations would think we're a little conservative in our forecast, but we just need to have a few more years of production history.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Fair enough. I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ipsit Mohanty with GMP Securities.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Most of my questions are answered, but if I could just \u2013 I couldn't stop but notice your impressive results in the Second Bone Spring in White City. But if I understand correctly, you're probably not going to do much on it for the rest of the year. Is that a component of HBP there and no need to go back there?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, yes. It is held by production, and our need to go back there is our need to generate top tier returns and it's about the best in our portfolio. I will say this, as I've said repeatedly, our current plan is a snapshot in time and if we were to accelerate activity, I think you'd find that to be a strong contender for increased activity. We're ready to go there and those wells are phenomenal.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Got you. And as you think about the second half of the year, sort of more held up by Cana \u2013 Cana's program, what's the extent of longer laterals \u2013 the longer laterals that you're going to drill there? What's the percentage of other wells that you're going to drill on long laterals?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah, this is John. Clearly, Tom talked about this, how we leverage off each region. And clearly, based on our experience now in Culberson, we've gotten extremely comfortable as a company in terms of drilling and completing long laterals. So we haven't \u2013 but done but one of those 10,000 foot laterals in Woodford so far, although we have a few 7,500. But without a doubt, we have areas now where we have a large acreage position that we operate and control where we envision long laterals being our go-to method for developing that acreage. We're not there yet, we still talk internally about it; but we do make plans that eventually we will be developing with 10,000 foot laterals in the Woodford. Because again, we've gained great confidence in our ability to do that based on our experience in the Permian.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And then to follow-up on John's comment, I want to just remind our listeners, at our Meramec program, the wells we've announced, are all 5,000 foot long horizontal wells and you will be comparing those with competitor wells that are largely 10,000 foot long horizontal wells. We've \u2013 are just in the process of our first 10,000 foot long Meramec well and we're very, very interested to see what that will generate.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Yeah, that's great color. But would you be drilling any longer lateral Woodford wells in the second half?","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","As of today, we don't have any definitive plans, but plans can change. I mean we are talking about, quite frankly, maybe one or two where we further delineate our acreage with 10,000 foot laterals, but nothing has been approved just yet.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Great. The rest all sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Paul Grigel with Macquarie.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Your previous production guidance that assumed CapEx at the low end of the range. How should we view the latest production guidance relative to CapEx and how much flexibility is built into production and CapEx?","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","Yeah. This is Joe. We've done the same this go-round as we did last. So what we've really done is just incorporate the first quarter well results that we've had and our projected timing and anticipated volumes for the remaining part of the year with the same budget.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's the low end of the range.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","It's the low end of the range.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And we've \u2013 although we're always updating our projection based on our latest well results. Some of the improvements we've made, we're modeling in in our projection, but we're testing a lot of things, and we don't have any future improvements modeled in. We're modeling current CapEx and current well performance.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. So just to be clear there, there's no acceleration or anything assumed; it's just the current program of six rigs running forward for the rest of the year and that's the production.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct. Low end of our range and 900 MMcfe is our guidance.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","And as we talked about last call, because our (01:00:20) had a couple of questions on this already, the profile itself is such that we see a peak in our total company production here in Q2 as we roll off the Permian completions and then into Q3, we start to pick up the Cana completions that give us a boost in the latter half of the year. So \u2013 and that's obviously implied when you look at our Q2 guidance versus our current forecast for our full year guidance.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And would we expect a production mix shift between gas and oil as we head into the back half of the year of a material amount given the change to the Cana projects?","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","Ironically enough, our Q4% gas was running around 49% and we'll end up there this year, at around 49%. We'll have some \u2013 a little bit of a dip in there in Q3 as we transfer out of the Permian into the \u2013 into Cana.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. That's all for me. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. And as there are no more questions at the present time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.","Karen Acierno - Director of Investor Relations","Thank you, Keith. So I guess we'd just like to thank everybody for participating in the call and please let us know if you have any further questions. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you.

In Denver, we have Tom Jorden, President, CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; Paul Korus, Senior Vice President and CFO; John Lambuth, VP of Exploration; and Jim Shonsey, our Vice President and Controller.","We issued our financial and operating results in the news release this morning, a copy of which can be found in our website. I need to remind you that today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss, and you should read our risk disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases for the risk factors associated with our business.","We have also posted a copy of the year-end investor presentation on our website, which we'll also be referring to, from time-to-time, on today's call.","So with that, we'll go ahead and jump into the call, I'll turn it over to Tom Jorden.","Thomas E. Jorden","Thanks, Mark, and welcome, everyone. It's a pleasure to be releasing our fourth quarter and full-year results this morning. We had a very nice year in 2012, and I really want to give credit to our organization across the board, for executing and performing on target with the plan we laid out this time a year ago. We had some headwinds to overcome, as those of you that follow us, in the past years. Very pleased that the underlying growth of our asset base is showing, and that Cimarex is on firm footing today and -- as we march through an uncertain future, so we've never felt better about the position of the company.","I'm going to be walking you through our results and will be referring to the slides that are posted on our website. I'll start with Slide 4, and will just be letting you know when I move a slide.","So to start, we had a solid fourth quarter, reporting record production for the quarter of 677 million cubic feet equivalent per day, and that was 13% greater than our Q4 2011. It's a very nice growth. We grew fourth quarter oil 28%, to another record, 35,099 barrels per day. Very, very nice oil growth.","Our full-year 2012 production averaged 625 -- excuse me, 626.5 million cubic feet equivalent a day or 6% greater than our 2011 production. Oil was the biggest driver of that growth. Oil production for 2012 averaged 31,463 barrels per day, increasing 17% over 2011.","Our oil and gas sales for 2012 are relatively flat, with higher production being offset by lower prices. Gas prices fell 35%, natural gas liquids prices, on average, dropped 28%, and oil was down 4%.","So we reported strong cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion and net income of $353.8 million or $4.07 per diluted share. Another metric that speaks for who we are, we ended the year with no bank debt and only $750 million of senior notes. As of year end, our debt-to-total capitalization was 18%.","And I just want to say at the outset, something we've said from time-to-time, we're not averse to borrowing money. That balance sheet is there to weather the commodity cycles and provide flexibility, but also there for opportunities. So even though we're classically a low-debt outfit, I wouldn't want to surprise anybody, we see that balance sheet as flexibility, and for the right opportunity, we'll tap it.","Moving on to Slide 5. We had a good year, adding significantly to our proved reserves. Very, very good year to the drill bit. We replaced 330% of production from extensions and discoveries. Proved reserves grew 10% to 2.3 Tcf equivalent. But if you exclude the property sales that we closed on in December, our reserves grew 13%. Oil reserves grew 18%, excluding property sales. We added 757.3 Bcf equivalent from drilling, and of those additions, 51% were liquids.","We invested $1.6 billion in exploration and development. We drilled 192 net wells and realized very solid returns in both our Permian and our Cana programs.","Overall, we had very strong execution in our key plays. We're very, very pleased with our core Mid-Continent and Permian programs, the execution we saw in 2012, the execution we're seeing as we look ahead to 2013 and also the investment returns that those plays offer us.","We had continued strong results in our Permian and Bone Spring plays. And John Lambuth, our Vice President of Exploration, will be giving you quite a bit of color on this, but we're increasingly excited about our Culberson County play. Both the Wolfcamp and the Bone Spring look attractive to us in that play. We've got the Wolfcamp in Reeves County, that's a new add for us, in addition to our core plays of the Second and Third Bone Spring.","The Permian also continues to develop new targets, some of which we haven't disclosed yet. And overall, it's a very, very nice place to operate, and we're seeing improving costs and operations performance.","Slide 6 shows our core operating areas. Year-end 2012 reserves are 2.3 Tcf equivalent. As you can see, 68% Mid-Continent, 31% Permian. And our fourth quarter 2012 production at 677 million cubic feet equivalent per day was 52% Mid-Continent and 43% Permian.","Slide 7 shows our growth in proved reserves from 2009 through 2012. We have a very, very solid proved reserve base. Our PUD percentage is still a very low 20%. One of the things I'll say about our reserves, they're solid, they're real. We do look-backs every year, back to the history of Cimarex in 2002. Our reserves have stood the test of time and we feel very, very confident in laying these reserves out to the investing public.","100% of our proved undeveloped reserves are currently in Cana.","As our investments have been pulled towards more liquids-rich areas of our portfolio, that's resulted in solid liquids growth. As you can see, we're currently 55% gas, 45% liquids. We've seen a nice compounded annual growth rate of 42% of our liquids, going back to 2009, and we expect to see that liquids growth continue as we continue to emphasize the Permian basin.","Moving on to Slide 8. Slide 8 shows our proved reserves by region. And we'd have -- we've had solid reserve growth in our core Permian and Mid-Continent areas. They have increased to the compound annual growth rate of 22% over the last 4 years. But more than just growth, that increase is a result of solid returns in our capital investment program.","As you know, we understand the challenge to grow, but mostly, we view our mandate as the challenge to reinvest our cash flow at high rates of return, and growth is a natural outcome of that. So we're very pleased, as we show you our production reserve growth, to be able to stand before you this morning and tell you that, that's an outcome of some investments that are very attractive to us, and we have a very nice investment portfolio that we're prosecuting in 2013 and beyond.","Going on to Slide 9. Looking forward into 2013, we're moving into this year at a very active drilling pace. And as we always say, we'll be carefully watching our returns. We've given our activity guidance, our investment guidance of between $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion, but we're going to keep our hand closely on the throttle. Depending on our own results, our opportunity set and commodity prices, that could be accelerated or decelerated. We certainly have the flexibility, based on the environment we find ourselves in.","We'll have a very active 2013 Permian program nonetheless. Our Bone Spring programs in New Mexico and Texas are performing very well. And again, John Lambuth will give you some color on that. And as I said a moment ago, we're getting very bullish on the Wolfcamp. Very pleased with our recent results. There've been some industry results that have confirmed what we've always known about the Wolfcamp, and it's rightly getting a lot of attention in the Delaware Basin.","In the Mid-Continent and Cana, we're seeing very good results in our infill drilling. One of the things we'll do, however, we'd like to manage our total capital to be in that $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, as we currently model it with our current model for our cash flow. So Cana is an area where we'll be adjusting our activity. And again, John will cover that in more detail.","Finally, in Slide 10. As we look at our capital investments over time, the Permian, in 2013, continues to get a slightly larger share of our total capital, over what it did in 2012. We currently project the Permian to be getting 55% -- excuse me, got 55% in 2012. We're projecting it to be 62% this year. The midpoint of our capital at $1.45 billion is down about 10% from last year. But again, we're going to see how it goes. Our cash flow is a certain and critical part of that equation and our results are a critical part of that equation, as are our costs of drilling and completing these wells.","But the good news is we're seeing solid returns in all our areas and lower capital, a result of wanting to keep our capital closer to cash flow.","Slide 11. There's a little pie chart that shows you our capital investments. We're currently running -- today, we have 15 rigs in the Permian, but we'll say, as we move through the year, we'll be between 11 and 14 rigs. We'll drill 150 gross or 105 net wells in the Permian. Those will be spread throughout our programs. In Cana, we'll continue our Cana infill development, and John, once again, will give you some color there. One of the things we're seeing in Cana, as a little bit of change from prior years, we're seeing more demands from other operators. So although our operated activity may decrease, it's being taken up, by and large, by outside operated activity.","And then the Gulf Coast. We're working on some new 3D data sets, and we expect to spend a small amount there this year, drilling 6 to 9 net wells.","Onto Slide 12. Slide 12 showcases the underlying growth engine of our company, and that's the Permian Basin and Mid-Continent. And you can see our production growth. Our investments are delivering that strong growth. For 2013, we expect continued predictable growth for Mid-Continent and Permian. And this is not growth for growth's sake. We're seeing solid economics in our Permian, and liquids-rich gas in both Mid-Continent and Permian, and 40% to 50% of our drilling results are liquids.","So we're seeing very, very nice returns in that Permian and Mid-Continent program. And that is -- has indeed, I think, become apparent to all, that's the engine of our growth.","Slide 13 showcases our Permian oil production and how that's grown over time. And that's driven by outstanding results in our Bone Spring drilling program in both Texas and New Mexico. The growth in 2013, excluding the impact of our year-end asset sale, is 8% to 12%.","So overall, we're seeing very nice results from our program. Again, I'm very proud of our organization and the way we've executed in 2012. We're firing on all cylinders as we enter 2013. With a healthy balance sheet, a fantastic inventory and good prospects for very nice returns on capital, we're looking forward to making 2013 again, a year in which we execute on target.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John Lambuth, our Vice President of Exploration.","John Lambuth","Thanks, Tom. I'm going to give you an update on our 2013 exploration drilling program. I'm going to first start with our most active region, as Tom mentioned, Permian Basin.","I'm on Slide 15, for those of you following along with the presentation. You will note that for 2013, our total expected capital investment will be approximately $900 million, which is just a little bit of an increase over 2012. You will also note, though, that the number of gross and net wells is down relative to 2012, with 150 gross for '13 relative to 182 for '12. The primary driver of that is just our overall portfolio, the type of wells we'll be drilling. Where in '12, we had quite a large inventory of shallow Paddock-Blinebry wells, we really don't have much of an inventory of those left for this year, thus, for the same capital, you get fewer wells because the overall portfolio is slightly more expensive.","Going onto Slide 16. As Tom mentioned, our bread-and-butter play has been the Bone Spring. In 2012, we drilled 107 gross, 60 net Bone Spring wells, with 64 in New Mexico, 43 in Texas. We continue to have very strong performance from this program. In New Mexico, our average 30-day IP for the 2012 wells was 640 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with those wells being primarily 90% oil.","In the Texas part of the Bone Spring, where we're mainly targeting the Third Bone Spring sand, the 30-day IP rates were 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 85% of it being oil.","We continue to see great results in both of these plays, and we expect that this will continue throughout 2013.","Of course, as we drill these wells, we learn and we try to look for areas to expand into, and we've done just that by moving into Culberson County. We have a couple of recent wells we're going to talk about, that have us very excited about the potential with our acreage there.","The first well is the Owl Draw 12 Unit 12H well. That well had a first 30-day average of 665 barrels of oil per day or an equivalent of over 1,000 of oil equivalent per day. We then followed that up with the Alysheba 17 2H. It had very similar results of 645 barrels of oil per day and over 1,100 barrels equivalent per day, wet gas plus oil, when we combine.","What's really exciting about this is that, in Culberson, we're actually slightly shallower than what we typically drill in New Mexico. And thus our well costs are even little bit less than what we usually experience in those other plays. So the type of returns we're getting from this play are very, very good.","When we look at this play and look at the totality of our acreage, we can put a wide range of potential locations here. In fact, the numbers range from 100 to 200. But the simple fact is we really don't know until we drill more wells and we get a very better idea of how we define and de-risk this play.","It is this encouragement that is leading us to maintain an approximate 2 rig schedule in Culberson, targeting this Second Bone Spring interval.","But of course, our acreage in Culberson was initially driven by our Horizontal Wolfcamp play. In 2012, we drilled 15 Horizontal Wolfcamp play, bringing the total number of wells we drilled within this White City Culberson area to 33 from its inception. As most of you know, we have been the leading driller and industry maker for this area.","We continue to see better and better performance from these wells as we try to continue to change the recipe in terms of frac-ing, fracture stimulation, and where we land our laterals. Please keep in mind that the Wolfcamp in Culberson is upwards of 600 to 700 feet gross thickness. So it's taken us a while to find that magic landing zone relative to frac to get the best performance, but we're definitely starting to see that.","As we show on Slide 17, from first quarter to fourth quarter 2012, we've been able to increase our liquid yield from 59 barrels per million to 97 barrels per million. That is definitely having a big impact on the type of rate of returns we can expect from these wells.","As you go to Slide 18, you see then over the last 3-year period, what our Horizontal Wolfcamp production looks like. You will note a couple of things: first off, we made a major investment in a new pipeline within Culberson County, we call Triple Crown. That pipeline, which was completed in late 2003, gives us the flexibility for multiple outlays for the -- for taking our gas to market.","That has also then enabled us to go out there and increase our drilling activity, which you see, resulted in a nice increase in production you see in 2012. We fully expect to see that continue to increase as we go into '13.","On Slide 19, you see, based on the most recent wells in terms of the average, we are presenting to you our type curve, essentially what we expect these types of wells to make. You will note that the 30-day average is 6.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, with an EUR range of 4.5 Bcfe to 5.5 Bcfe. Although in this case, this particular type curve is a 5.4 Bcf equivalent. The makeup of that hydrocarbon is 47% gas, 30% NGL and 23% oil.","If you now go to Slide 20, and I use that type curve, along with our net revenue interest of 75%. And then finally, our most recent AFE for a completed well being $7.2 million, you will see that, with a forward strip from February 11 of '13, we are able to generate in the low-30 type of internal rate of return for this type of program. This really is exciting for us because, as you recognize, this shale play is rather extensive over this acreage, and thus great potential is there for us. I'm sorry, that's an APAX [ph] rate of return.","Furthermore, then, in summary for Wolfcamp in White City and Culberson, along with our improving results in terms of the production we're seeing, we're also seeing a nice decrease in our well costs over time. In 2011, our average well cost was around $10 million. 2012, it decreased again, down to around the mid-8s. And now for 2013, we're seeing somewhere in the mid-7s, a nice decrease, which again only helps with the type of returns we'll get from these wells.","If we look again at our total acreage position and just look at the overall potential, then we've shown you a table of what the future may hold for us in this play. Now I must emphasize strongly, we have not yet drilled a downspacing pilot to determine what our ultimate spacing will be. With that said, on the conservative side of just 160 acres, or 4 wells per section, based on our current acreage position, we would have 500 net wells with a reserve potential of 1.7 to 2.1 Tcf. And that would require a capital investment of $3.6 million. Obviously, if we could prove via a downspacing pilot, even tighter spacing, essentially going down to 80, that would result in the doubling of those numbers. Again, we need to, at some point, plan a spacing pilot, but as of right now, we're still in the mode of HBP-ing in our acreage in order to secure our acreage position.","But as Tom mentioned, that's not the only place that we are drilling Horizontal Wolfcamp wells. We do have a significant position at Reeves County, approximately over 35,000 acres. We have drilled 2 wells now on that acreage position. We are in the early parts of flowback on those wells. What I can tell you is we are very encouraged with the results we're seeing, so much so that for this year, we plan to drill approximately 3 additional tests in the immediate area to better define the opportunity there.","I'm now on Slide 22. I'll be stepping to the Mid-Continent region. On that slide, you will see that for 2013, our estimated capital investment will be $450 million as compared to $673 million for 2012. As you know, for Mid-Continent, the majority of that money goes to Cana-Woodford. In regards to the change in capital, from $673 million to $450 million, you need to keep in mind that in 2012, for that program, over 37% of wells we drilled were one-off or exploratory wells, to better define the Cana opportunity for us. 63% were infill core drilling. When we look at our 2013 program, over 90% of the wells that we will be drilling to participate in, are infill core programs. That is where we're going to get our best rate of returns and that is where we're focusing our capital on.","From the inception of this play, as you see on Slide 23, we have drilled or participated in over -- approximately 492 wells, through the first -- fourth quarter 2012. We have a very strong land position of 120,000 net acres, of which, as we show on the display there, we have delineated what we call a gas-rich down-dip area, up-dip liquid-rich area. Within the liquid-rich area, we have 75,000 acres, of which almost all of them now are in a held-by position status. So we really are not driven anymore to go out to drill wells to hold acreage, it's just a matter of maximizing our opportunity in terms of picking the best rate of return.","As we go to Slide 24 then, we are doing just that with our infill drilling program. We are essentially carrying forward into 2013 what we are doing through the majority of 2012. We have 4 operated rigs, currently. We -- for full development in Cana, we are drilling 8 new wells per section, in addition to the existing parent well. That results in 9 wells per section. We plan for 2013 to have 125 gross wells, that's 35 operated, 90 non-operated. I will point out that, for 2012, we participated or drilled in 128 gross wells. So there's not that large a difference between '12 and '13 when it comes to Cana infill development.","On Slide 25, you see a display or graph of our net production from Cana-Woodford for the past 3 years. You will note, in the first 2 quarters in '12, there was a slowdown to -- in fact, a slight decrease. And that was due to the fact that, to start the infill development program, we need to develop a sufficient buffer space between our actively drilling wells and the frac fleet. Once we accomplish that, we then immediately start to develop, or frac-ing wells, and then you see that nice ramp-up in production in the last 2 quarters there.","It's that type of production growth again, we'd expect in '13 with this infill drilling program.","So in summary for Cana-Woodford, we exited fourth quarter 2012 with net production of 215 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which was a 30% increase over fourth quarter 2011. And at the bottom, I still want to point out, there's still great potential here, even though we've already embarked on an infill development program. To date, we have 1.1 Tcf of equivalent gas proved for Cana. And yet, we still show a risk upside within that liquid-rich core area of 3.3 Tcf, which would equate to 660 net wells and close to $5 billion of capital. So total risked resources for Cana, as you see there on that slide, is 4.4 Tcf.","Finally, on Slide 27. A quick word on our Gulf Coast program. As those of you who follow us know, Gulf Coast is our higher-risk, greater-reward opportunity region. It is a region that is entirely dependent upon 3D seismic and the attribute work we do with that to pinpoint our drilling locations. In 2012, we made a major investment in a number of new 3D surveys, in order to replenish our drilling inventory.","That data has been acquired, processed, it is in house. We are currently rebuilding that inventory and hope to be drilling again in the second quarter of this year. But I want to emphasize, unlike the other regions, we do not think of Gulf Coast as a rig line, as much as it is of capturing good opportunity. We hope that there will be 10 gross, 7 net wells there. But again, it's all about the quality of the opportunity we have, and if it's good, we will drill it, if not, then we won't reach that number.","With that, I will hand it over to Joe Albi, who will talk about the productions for Cimarex.","Joseph R. Albi","Thanks, John. I will be going over our fourth quarter and 2012 production statistics. I'll hit a little bit on our 2013 guidance and then just a few comments on where we ended the year with LOE and where we see current service costs. For those of you following along, I'll start here on Slide 29.","And to echo Tom's earlier comments in the call, we really did have a great year. We had some strong October and November new well adds that helped prop our fourth-quarter volumes up to a level of 677 million equivalents a day. That was right at the upper end of our guidance of 652 million to 677 million, and up 13% from where we were in Q4 '11 at 601 million a day.","All the while, we set a new record in the fourth quarter for total company production, and the driver to that growth, as we've alluded to already in this call, was our increased oil production, which grew 28% over Q4 '11 to a record of 35,099 barrels a day in Q4.","Also helping the quarter were minimal production disruptions for plant turnarounds, ethane rejection and other downtime, which, those of you following us for a while have known, did impact us a little bit more, earlier in 2012.","We dig deeper into the numbers, we continue to see production growth from our Permian and Mid-Continent programs. Our record fourth quarter Permian net equivalent volume of 292 million a day was up 6% or 17 million a day from Q3 '12, and up 36% or 77 million a day from fourth quarter of 2011.","Our oil growth was the real driver here, with our Q4 Permian oil volumes averaging 27,091 barrels a day, another record for the company, and up 42% from fourth quarter last year. We're drilling some really great wells, and it's showing up in our numbers, with some strong adds from really virtually all our programs in the Permian. Our Texas and New Mexico Bone Spring plays, as well as our Wolfcamp program.","Our fourth quarter Mid-Continent equivalent volume of 351 million a day was also a record for the company. It was up 8% from last quarter and 11% from a year ago. Cana continued to drive the increase, with record fourth quarter volumes of 215 million a day, that's up 31 million a day from last quarter and a respectable 57 million a day from Q4 '11.","With that, Cana now represents 32% of our total company production. So in a nutshell, Q4 came in, I'd say, as modeled, but I'll say it came in on the high end of our model, reflected significant increased volumes from our Permian and Mid-Continent programs. And as a result, our full-year 2012 equivalent production came in at a record 626.5 million a day, which was up 6% from our 2011 average of 592 million a day.","And driving the year-over-year growth was really 3 important factors: a 43% increase in Permian oil volumes; a 15% increase in our total liquid volumes; and a 21% increase in our combined Permian and equivalent -- excuse me, Mid-Continent equivalent volumes. Definitely, a good year.","Shifting over to Slide 30, where we look at production by region. Big obvious thing pops out here, and that is we've seen a nice increase in our total liquid production over the last few years. Our Q4 liquid volumes averaged 57,217 barrels a day. Looking back 3 years ago, that's 2.5x the 22,935 barrels a day we averaged in the fourth quarter of 2009.","The catalyst to the growth has been the Permian, which accounts now for 61% of our total liquid production. That said, we're also seeing nice contribution from Cana, which is the backbone to the 35% of the total company liquids comprised by the Mid-Continent.","The Mid-Continent still represents the lion's share of our gas production at 69%, and our total company equivalent production of 677 million a day is now nicely balanced between the Mid-Continent and the Permian, with the Mid-Continent representing 52% of the total and the Permian at 43%.","On Slide 31. Looking forward to our 2013 production guidance. We're projecting our 2013 equivalent daily volumes to average in the range of 675 million to 705 million equivalents per day for the year. That's up 8% to 13% over 2012. Built into this estimate is the $294 million Permian property sale that we closed on at the end of the year, which reduced our net volumes by 2,550 equivalent barrels per day, 2,000 barrels a day of which was oil.","If you're looking at the table in the presentation, you'll see our projected 2013 oil growth to be quoted at 1% to 5%. But if we exclude the impact of that sale, in essence, we're projecting 7% to 11% oil production growth, and so we have a very good chance for a second year of double-digit oil production growth here in 2013.","Although our Gulf Coast production is modeled to contribute only 3% to 4% of our total company production, we do have some drilling planned for the program this year and have incorporated a modest, I'll call it, heavily risked drilling wedge of 5 million to 10 million a day for the year, which has been built into our modeled projections.","Hence, from 30,000 feet, what we're projecting is for 2013 to look quite similar to 2012. Strong double-digit Permian and Mid-Continent production growth in the range of 11% to 15%, with an emphasis on liquids, which as modeled, would bring our liquid percentage up to 51% by the end of '13.","Our first quarter guidance of 614 -- or, excuse me, 642 million to 667 million has been reduced by about 15.5 million a day, for a recent property sale, as well as some weather and other facility shut-ins that we experienced in early January. In essence, after accounting for the property sale and the shut-ins, we're projecting Q1 to be fairly flat with our strong Q4 '12 results.","Shifting gears over to operating expense on Slide 32, as we talked about before in our previous calls, our production group has put a great deal of energy into fighting the overall cost increases the industry has seen over the last year in LOE, in particular, in the area of SWD and more specifically, in the Permian.","In addition, we've undertaken measures to control workover costs company-wide. Well our efforts are showing up in the financials, with a Q4 lifting costs coming in at $1.06 per Mcfe, that's down another $0.01 from where we were in the third quarter of 2012 and we're down $0.12 or 10% from Q4 '11. Our Q4 '12 lifting cost is the lowest lifting cost we've seen since late 2010.","Looking forward into 2013, we've projected our full year ROE guidance at $1.05 to $1.17, and hoping to fall in on the lower end of that range.","Just a few comments on service costs before I turn the call over to Paul. On the drilling side, similar to what we discussed last quarter, we are seeing most cost components remain relatively in check, but we are seeing continued signs of a softening rig market, as evidenced by recorded day rates down anywhere from 3% to 5% from last year.","Our biggest cost savings continue to come in the form of drilling efficiencies and lower per unit frac costs. An interesting observation, when we compiled our frac statistics at the end of the year, our total company frac statistics show we pumped upwards of 20% to 30% more sand and fluid in 2012 than in 2011, yet our overall frac costs were down 18%. And that's really a combination of pumping more white sand, reduced service costs and additional horsepower on the market.","Looking more specifically at individual well costs, in Cana, our drilling efficiencies and lower frac costs have brought our current AFEs in the core infill program down to about $7 million, total well cost. That's $400,000 lower than what we quoted last call and down $1 million from where we were a year ago, so it's paying off in Cana.","In the Permian, our Horizontal Second Bone Spring wells continue to run in the $6.5 million to $7.1 million range, while drilling efficiencies in our West Texas Third Bone program have brought total well costs down to $7.2 million -- around $7.2 million. That's $300,000 lower than the figure we quoted last call.","And finally, our Horizontal Wolfcamp wells are running $7 million to $7.5 million, total well costs. That's down from $8 million to $8.5 million, the levels that we saw about 6 months ago.","So all in all, we're quite excited about where we are. Our production and our reserves are trending up, while our lifting and well costs are trending down. We've got a deep multi-year inventory of drilling projects in the Permian and the Mid-Continent, probably the richest inventory XEC ever had. And all those are very good reasons to find ourselves in a pretty good position here, starting out in 2013.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Korus.","Paul Korus","Thank you, Joe. If you'll page forward to Slide 34, I'm a little brief, I only have one slide.","Despite the fall in gas and oil prices during 2012, we had reasonably good earnings, driven by nice growth in production and proved reserves. After investing $1.6 billion in 2012, we ended the year with $750 million of debt. That was inched up, if you will, from about $400 million at the end of 2011.","So still plenty of capacity on the balance sheet, but please do recognize that our prior tolerance of note debt has at least evolved into a tolerance of some, albeit still low, amount of debt.","We had -- as we mentioned repeatedly, we had good growth in production of 6%, which actually met the midpoint of our very original guidance for the year. And we increased our proved reserves by 10% to 2.3 Tcf, adding 750 Bcfe of reserves through new drilling, which was more than 3x our production for the year. And we had good finding [ph]  costs and good rates of return doing it.","So as we look to 2013, our expected capital, at the present time, gives a very narrow range for us of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. But as Tom mentioned, please appreciate that we reserve the right to increase it some or decrease it some, as the year evolves.","Still, at the tight range that we're giving, our expectations are for double-digit growth in production and reserves in 2013.","Those are my comments. Kayla, we would be happy to entertain questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from Phil Jungwirth from BMO Capital Markets.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","On the oil production guidance for 2013, 32,000 to 33,000 barrels a day, it seems to be a little bit lower than the 4Q average, even adjusting for the assets. So can you address why this would be the case? And is it mostly just conservatism on your part, given that greater allocation of capital is going towards the Bone Spring and you've seen better results there?","Joseph R. Albi","Phil, this is Joe, I'll answer that. Yes, if you look at the slide, it says, hey, without the property sales, we're showing 1% to 5% growth. When we throw those back in there, 7% to 11% growth. Our projections do incorporate risking. And if we're off, I think what it's basically telling us is that we've got a very strong chance of having another year of double-digit production growth. There's a couple of other things that are at play here, too. At any one given point in time, new wells make up 40% to 50% of our total company production. And those new wells, even these permian wells, they can come screaming off pretty hard. So we're always constantly fighting the snowball effect of new well decline, which can impact the rates of production growth and certainly have an impact on what ends up being the final product of our modeling. But as Tom alluded to earlier in the call, as those of you who've known us for all these years, we are focused on rate of return. And it's all about rate of return. And to the degree that production is a byproduct of that, so be it. Obviously, we want our production to go up. That year or -- all that said, our model is really showing that we have a very, very good chance of another year of double-digit production growth. And we're really pretty pleased with that. Being able to have double-digit production growth is not something to not be proud of. So that's, I guess, our answer to that question.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, this is Tom. If I could just follow up that up. Joe has done this for a long time and he's gotten quite astute at making these models. Our business units send in what they think they're going to do and they time it out, and Joe takes that and looks to see what historically they've done. In the oil patch, things tend to go more wrong than they go right. You have delays in timing, you have delays in equipment. And so Joe factors in what he thinks is our historical average and he risks those business unit models down. That said, the business unit modelers are getting better and better at it. They're going to challenge him and if all goes right, we're going to beat that number. But we'll just have to see as we go through the year.  It'd be nice to have a year where all goes right, but it would be our first.","Joseph R. Albi","The other thing I want to add because I'm guessing we'll get the question, is on Q1, with our guidance being lower than Q4. Well, a couple of things at play there and this is also impacting our total number. But the Permian Basin sales that we closed on at the very end of the month last year, took about 15.5 million a day off our first quarter production. We also had a number of freezing issues and pipeline issues, and particularly in Culberson County, in early January, that hurt January to the tune of about 16 million a day, that built into that number. We also had a handful of good strong fourth quarter wells that came on in October and November that were on a very good screaming decline here in November and early January that we were fighting. And all of that, when you add it all up says, hey, we're going to be at about flat with Q4, which was strong quarter for us. We were at the upper end of our production guidance. All that said, the model is also saying that we anticipate production to start picking up here pretty quickly in February, and our early indications are that production is doing just that. And when you take a look at our production guidance for the year, and you look at 675 million to 705 million and you compare it to where we were in Q1 or what we're given guidance in Q1, hey, it smells an awful lot like what we told you guys last year. We're going to be kind of flat for the first half of the year and we expect to ramp up here at the end of the year and, lo and behold, that happened. And that's what we're modeling this year. We're going to have a little bit of a delayed start here in the first quarter, primarily as a result of the property sale. Our model is saying that, come around second quarter, we're going to start to see some real nice production growth. And ultimately, I hope, allow us to talk quarter-to-quarter about continued record numbers. So kind of a long answer to your question but I thought I'd knock off the second question because I thought it was going to get asked.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Here's a third question on the guidance. On the NGL production growth of 33% to 39%, is any of that driven by a change in processing contracts and then reporting the NGLs as opposed to leaving it in the gas stream?","Joseph R. Albi","No, most of that is all due to the existing contracts, which have already been modified. Most of the old contracts that could be rewritten or revised, all that's been done. So anything really showing up now is all through new adds.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then final question here, I appreciate all the Wolfcamp disclosure. It looks like there could be some variability in the GOR as you move from the south to the north. Is that the case or am I just drawing some conclusions from 2 wells here?","John Lambuth","I don't know. You should -- this is John Lambuth. I don't know you should draw any conclusion from just 2 wells. I would say, clearly, based on how we understand that formation, there is variability. But we tend to think as more of an east-west trend than north-south. But again, we still get surprises as we continue to drill this. But I would say not north-south necessarily, just based on those 2 wells.","Thomas E. Jorden","But we also see a primary variability, stratigraphically. And that's a complex system.","John Lambuth","It is, and that's something again, I want to emphasize. It's a very thick shale and we have really honed in on a particular interval, where we're getting our best results. And you would expect us  then to get much more consistent results as we go forward, because that's the interval that we're primarily going to be drilling in.","Thomas E. Jorden","And we're obviously -- our excitement about the Wolfcamp comes through in our comments. But we're really early times here and, with the interval as thick as it is, we have a lot of that stratigraphy we haven't tested. So we're, as yet, uncertain as to what our ultimate spacing will be, either laterally or vertically. I mean, there's an argument that says 8 wells per section is not adequate to fully exploit this resource. But the truth of the matter is, we don't know, and we really would like to get data rather than speculation.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mario Barraza with Tuohy Brothers.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Mario Barraza here. Just want to dive a little deeper on the Second Bone play on the Texas side. Last quarter -- are we still thinking just over 125 well locations is a comfortable count for this point? I know you guys said right now, 100 to 200 locations. But what percentage of your acreage in Culberson do you think this is prospective?","John Lambuth","Well, this is John Lambuth, again, and I guess, I would say 100 to 200 locations. I mean, we are very, very early. If you think we're early in Wolfcamp, we're very early in this play. We have 2 very good, very exciting wells that we wanted to tell you about. We have very limited well control. Basically, our well control in that area is our Wolfcamp drilling. It helps define that shallower Second Bone Spring. But unlike the Wolfcamp, there's quite a bit of stratigraphic variability in the Second Bone Spring, so with each well we drill, we learn a little bit more, some to the negative, some to the positive. All I can tell you is, just looking at our acreage position and the current wells we have, we see definite potential and it's in the range that I just mentioned. This year will be very important for us because we have a lot of wells. We will be drilling to test it and further define it. So maybe during the course of the year, we might be able to give you a little bit better update. But we're just being honest, this is how we see it right now, based on the limited well data we have.","Thomas E. Jorden","This is Tom, if I could just follow-up on that. We've long recognized the potential of Second Bone Spring in Culberson County. This is not news to us. The reason that we haven't talked about it prior to the last call or 2 is because we expected it to be gassy. Based on our overall trend in the basin, we looked at that and this part of the basin and thought, it's probably gassy. We had good shows and we drilled through it, but we hadn't tested it. And these first tests, ours and there are some offset operators, have really surprised us pleasantly. We really didn't expect the Second Bone Spring to be as oily as it is. I mean, these are fantastic oil wells. And so when you ask what controls these 100 or 200 locations? We have that sand map throughout this Culberson block. We have very good shows when we drilled through it. We're just hesitant to get too out in front of ourselves and say how oily or gassy it is, and that's the main controlling factor. Is it going to continue to be oily or will there be pockets of this land where it's a little heavier gas? So that's why we are not waving the checkered flag just yet, but we're very, very encouraged by the results we have, limited though they may be.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, appreciate that color. If I can shift gears towards the CapEx budget for this year. On the last call, you talked about -- you were going to exit the year with 4 to 5 rigs in Cana, but if gas prices stayed depressed, you might -- you were considering shifting out, possibly some rigs and transferring some more CapEx dollars to the                                                                Permian. What's kind of the price lever you're thinking about for -- where would you pull back on the number of rigs in Cana?","John Lambuth","Well, this is John Lambuth, again. I really couldn't pick a particular price. Again, it's going to be a matter of rate of return. And that's going to be dictated by the type of section we have an opportunity to drill. Again, the yield, the NGL mix, really dictates that rate of return, more than the gas price even. So we're constantly monitoring both our results to make sure we're hitting our expected volumes and our drill costs. Right now, we're very encouraged, I mean, very encouraged with what we're seeing coming out of Cana but, that said, we're always keeping an eye toward gas prices. And yes, if it drops to a level where we don't see it to be economic, we will slow that down or even shut it.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, it's Tom. It's really a function of how much money we want to borrow this year, more than anything else. Our cash flow is what it is, and we're trying to allocate it. Our returns in Cana are quite good. Our returns in the Permian, in general, are slightly better, and it's a function of how much money we want to borrow.","Paul Korus","It's Paul. I'll just add that, whether we run these 4 rigs through roughly the middle of the year or whether we run them all through the year, it's only about a $50 million swing. So it really won't move the needle that much in terms of capital or production volumes in 2013, because the wells drilled in the first half will be frac-ed in the second half, roughly. It would have further implications for 2014, perhaps, in terms production volumes. But it's not a needle mover.","John Lambuth","I mean, I would just say, again, I would emphasize, we're getting some really great results and they're really making it hard for us to not want to go ahead and get those rigs going. I'll leave it that way. I mean, really good results so far as we start this year.","Thomas E. Jorden","But we have not made a final decision. We currently have 4 rigs running at Cana, and we've not made a final decision.","John Lambuth","That is correct.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jeff Robertson with Barclays.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Tom, in the Wolfcamp play in Culberson County, can you talk about where you think you'll be with some of these questions, just around stratigraphy and spacing, by the end of the year? By the end of 2013, that is?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, there's really 2 issues, Jeff. And I'd invite John to chime in here. One is, we're still sampling real estate. If you look at our current penetrations, although we think we've got a lot more than we know, there's still a lot of that area that's very finely sampled. So we need to just sample the real estate over that acreage block. We don't currently have planned this year a spacing pilot. Now that's something else that we're still kind of arguing about, because that's -- our experience in Cana is that, that's something you want to know as early as you can for full development. But right now, we don't have a spacing pilot planned for the Wolfcamp. And so we don't know yet what the spacing will be, both laterally and vertically. So your question is, what are we going to know by the end of the year? I think under our current plan, we're going to know the liquids yield and the producibility of that rock over a wider area than we've currently sampled, but in our current plan, we probably won't know any more about spacing than we do now.","John Lambuth","This is John Lambuth. I agree. I mean, the only thing I'd add, besides just the overall productivity of these wells is, again, we're very excited about what we're seeing with our drilling complete costs and, really, right now, as we look at these wells, that really is going to be one of the bigger drivers to the type of rate of returns we get. And so far, we're very encouraged by what we see going on in regards to those costs, both from the drill side, but especially on the completion side, is something Joe alluded to earlier. We're definitely seeing a decrease in our completion costs, and that really is very impactful for these wells.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Second question on that play. I think you said there are several different zones within the Wolfcamp. Is all of your drilling going into what you think is the same Wolfcamp interval?","John Lambuth","This is John Lambuth, again. Early on, we were, how do you say, all over the court? I mean, trying to understand, optimally, where we should be. It's fair to say, going forward, we've kind of honed in on the particular interval. We break it up into A, B, C, D and E. In our case, we have a particular interval that we now feel really good about and that's where you'd expect us to put the majority of our wells going forward.","Thomas E. Jorden","If I might add to that, Jeff. Some of the new drilling you're seeing over in Reeves County is in the shallow-most stratigraphy in that Wolfcamp. That's something that we haven't sampled in Culberson County, and there's a -- it looks interesting to us, we don't have a well in it. And it might be additive to everything else were doing and it might not be either\/or, it might be additive. And please take that with a grain of salt, don't run out and update your model on that. We just don't know. I mean, we're just -- it looks to us like this Wolfcamp is going to be a legacy asset that can stand tall next to Cana for the future of Cimarex. That's the message this morning. The detail, whether it's $7 billion, $10 billion, $15 billion of future capital, we just don't know. But it's here to stay and we like it.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","One last question. Is there the ability to increase acreage in the play, in the areas that you think are promising?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, we did increase acreage in 2012. We made a couple of acreage acquisitions that we talked about. It's getting skinny on the broad brushes. But we still get up every morning, and we wrestled home some things and we're continuing to do that. But I wouldn't want to start from scratch today in that part of the real estate, that part of the world.","Operator","And your next question comes from Joe Magner with Macquarie Capital.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","I just wanted to, I guess, get a sense on when, during the year, do you think you'll have enough information or insight into some of these new opportunities? And the results seem very encouraging, rates of return seem very equivalent across different plays and competitive with existing development opportunities. I'm just curious when we might start to expect to hear decisions on increasing capital or drilling additional wells?","John Lambuth","Well, I guess -- this is John Lambuth. What new -- which ones you're referring to, just specifically, so I can....","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Well, I guess, the Second Bone Spring opportunity in Culberson, in particular, and then the Wolfcamp Shale, over in that same general vicinity, seemed like the 2 areas, at least where results could be supportive.","John Lambuth","Well, I would just say, in Culberson, I think we're pretty set on that 1 to 2 rig schedule for this year, as we continue to identify the opportunity there.","Thomas E. Jorden","For the Bone Spring, in addition to the Wolfcamp.","John Lambuth","For the Bone Spring, in addition to the","Wolfcamp, you're absolutely right, Tom. That all -- like we say, that's always subject to change based on performance. But right now, we think that's the adequate rig schedule and capital we need to fully define that opportunity. Clearly, by the end of the year, we'll have a much better understanding of it. In terms of Reeves County, all I'll say is, we really need some more well performance and perhaps even a couple more wells, before even we're ready to talk about it. We need time there. Again, I'll just say we're encouraged. But we need a couple more wells, and we just need to see some more consistent performance, and then we'll probably be in a better position to talk about it.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. And I guess with respect to the Horizontal Wolfcamp that's been focused in New Mexico, 33 wells drilled to date, how much of that acreage has been held now? And what is required, I guess, through this year, to be able to -- this year into next year, to lock up more of that acreage?","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, in the New Mexico, in that Wolfcamp trend, it's by and large, I won't say 100%, but it's almost all held. We have a couple of obligation wells that we drill every year but other than that, we don't have any kind of an acreage exploration that's driving our New Mexico portion.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. And there's one last one for me. I believe you all have been working on some other shallow liquids opportunities, or other Mid-Continent liquids opportunities. Any update on any of those new initiatives?","John Lambuth","No, no new update as of today. You are right in that there are a couple of plays that we have been pursuing. We still have some more evaluating and drilling to do in those plays. We really can't add any color to that today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A question -- I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but I just wanted to follow up on the guidance for this year. The 60 million cubic feet a day that you talked about that was affected by shut-ins in  Culberson County, is that just 60 million cubic feet a day in January or is that across the entire first quarter?","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe. That, for the most part, those were very mature properties with very shallow declines.","John Lambuth","So it came from the shut-ins, Joe.","Joseph R. Albi","Oh, for the shut in. I thought -- the freeze-outs [ph] , for the most part, appear to behind us. We will have, in the Culberson County area, probably in the first part of Q2, some work done to high-grade some of our pegging facilities and improve some of the line itself. So there'll be a little bit of downtime there, but it looks like the freezing issues in January are behind us.","Thomas E. Jorden","But it's just January. It's built into our Q1 guidance.","Joseph R. Albi","So if you were to divide it by 3, I guess, if you want to take a look at that.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then on the -- how would you describe -- I mean, can walk me through to the state of infrastructure, I guess, as you look forward over the course of 2013? I mean, how much conservatism did you build into the numbers from potential infrastructure downtime? I guess, I'm still having a little bit of a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that, for 18 months, you've done kind of 2,000 barrels a day sequentially each quarter, Permian oil growth, and it seems to have flattened off.  I'm just trying to figure out is that -- how much that it's infrastructure downtime conservatism you're building in versus anything else?","Joseph R. Albi","There's maybe, if you were to take a look at the Permian, I'll just tell you in equivalents, I don't know how it's going to answer the oil side of it. But I venture to say that we, just on base properties, have integrated somewhere the range of 7 million to 10 million a day of a risk in our base property production that you could attribute to being directly associated with downtime, because that's about what we saw last year as an average. Second quarter last year, I think, we had a 14 million a day impact for the quarter, and most of that was in the Permian. And let's face it, the Permian is a tight deal out there. And we're constantly finding it. We had a few wells here in Q1 that we delayed fracs on, waiting to get the connections put into place. So I guess, if you're looking for a number, that'd be about the number I'd give you. Other than that, I always take a minute when I answer this question this way, too. What we're trying to do with our guidance, heck, the majority of that number is coming from new wells, and we're trying to predict when we're going to drill, and when we're going to hit the good ones, what they're going to produce, and for the most part, I'm really pretty amazed, as close as we all get playing this game, when you're trying to project what you're going to see. So we inherently put, maybe, a 70% to 80% risk into our region on risk numbers, based on history. And that's kind of how we end up where we end up. We look at capital utilization, how well we spent money and added production and so forth, and then come up with our final number.","Mark Burford","Ryan, this is Mark. I have one other thought to add to that discussion, is that, as you pointed out in the slide, for the guidance slide, we talked about oil growth, excluding property sale, being 7% to 11%. And the risking that Joe is alluding to and then further risking, if you take our risked\/unrisked team's wedge, as Tom alluded to, probably be adding a few thousand barrels a day to these numbers. And if we add that back into these guidance numbers, it'll probably be close to 20% growth year-over-year in oil. So we definitely have tried to build in some uncertainty with the infrastructure, uncertainty in well timing, all those factors that go into guidance. But definitely, there's a lot more upside in these numbers if we hit our plan, but we know historically, there's always timing -- issues with timing, infrastructure, and those things. And so we try to build in, we think, would be a reasonable amount of conservatism for the numbers we can think we can reasonably achieve.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, one last thing for me from an  infrastructure point of view, as the pipelines come in, connecting the Permian to the Gulf over the course of the year, I mean, how do you -- you've obviously seen the differential come in quite a bit up to this point, I mean how do you view that playing out over the rest of the year? Do you see upside in terms of potential to narrow that differential or maybe even go at a premium to WTI at any point? Or...","Mark Burford","WTI premium -- WTI, no, Ryan. We don't see that potential occurring. We're grateful to see it tightening to where it's gone. But I mean, we've -- when we look at the forward curve, I'd say it's still at around $1 range, that's -- we look at our models, and we don't assume it to go to premium, but we don't also assume to buying [ph]  back out like we saw early late last year and early part of this year.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Mark Burford","Great. Thank you all for joining us on the fourth quarter conference call. I look forward to reporting to you next quarter. Take care. Bye-bye.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

Please note, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Karen Acierno. Please go ahead.","Karen Acierno - Director of Investor Relations","Thanks, Amy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Cimarex second quarter 2015 conference call. Last night, an updated presentation was posted to our website. We will be referring to this presentation during the call today.","As a reminder, our discussions will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business.","Today's prepared remarks will begin with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden; followed by an update on our drilling activities and results from John Lambuth, VP of Exploration; and then, Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on operations, including production and well costs. Paul Korus and Mark Burford are also here in the room to help answer any questions you might have.","With that, I will turn it over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Karen, and thanks to everyone who's participating in today's conference. We appreciate your interest in Cimarex. I'd like to take a few minutes to share my thoughts on the current environment before turning it over to John and Joe for the details of our first quarter results and our plans for the rest of 2015.","During this call, you'll hear about new wells that are outperforming our expectations, leading to another production beat. We now have 18 long laterals with over 30 days of production in the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp, several of which have been online for more than six months. We're gaining a much better understanding of the production characteristics and potential of these longer horizontal wells. The data we've gathered has strengthened our enthusiasm for the long-term potential of this play for Cimarex. We've always been a company that emphasizes science and innovation, and this emphasis is yielding results in spacing pilots, well design, completion design, and unraveling geologic complexity.","The second quarter was punctuated by advances in each of these areas. Of particular interest, subtle changes in our horizontal landing zone have had enormous impact on well optimization. We're now at a point where we're ready to move ahead in our first development project in the Wolfcamp D in Culberson County with drilling scheduled to begin in January on a six-section project. More about that in a moment.","Also in the Delaware basin, Second Bone Spring results continued to impress. These wells are among the best in our portfolio with multiyear running room. We will also update you in our continued success in the Woodford Shale and the Meramec play. The Cana-Woodford shale and Meramec continue to be a laboratory for continuing improvements in innovation. We have further delineated our acreage, optimized our simulations, and are testing new landing zones.","We remain quite bullish on the long-term multi-pay potential of our Cana and Delaware basin assets. To that end, we see the opportunity for a modest acceleration as we move into 2016. We have $730 million of additional capital following our issuance of equity in May. As a result, our 2015 capital expenditures have an increase by $100 million which will fund the beginnings of several exciting projects including a Wolfcamp A, downspacing pilot in Culberson County and more Bone Spring and Meramec activity.","But perhaps most exciting is what we have on tap for 2016. In addition to Cimarex beginning its first Wolfcamp D development in Culberson County, the first development in Reeves County will begin as well. We're also planning additional infill in the Woodford and Meramec, including the possibility of a long lateral development later in the year. We'll conduct down spacing pilots in the Meramec as well as stack testing of the Woodford and Meramec for future development.","These development projects in the Delaware and Anadarko Basins are complex and require considerable planning. The multi-zone stack potential of our asset provides tremendous opportunity and challenges. We have the opportunity to significantly increase capital efficiency by exploiting multiple zones within a single development project. We have challenges in that this requires careful planning and understanding of the geologic complexity, for you cannot always back up and capture a zone that was missed in the initial development.","Our organization is hard at work preparing for effective execution of these projects. John will provide additional color on these efforts. We intend to live within our current capital structure, and with the recently added equity funding to not incur additional debt during 2015 or 2016. We do debt as a long-term commitment, and we're hesitant to make long-term commitments in this volatile environment.","We have seen service costs further decrease. Looking at current well cost in two of our most often drilled well designs, a Cana-Woodford infill well and a Wolfcamp D long lateral, we've seen total well cost decline 30% and 20%, respectively, from their peak in 2014. We've also made significant progress on lowering lease operating expenses driven primarily by reducing saltwater disposal cost. Joe will give additional detail on this during the call.","Since our last call, the recovery we saw in oil prices was short-lived, and natural gas prices remain depressed. Despite this negative backdrop, Cimarex is moving forward, investing in our exceptional assets. The conversation since last fall has been dominated by discussions regarding the commodity price cycle and expectations of a recovery. I said at the time that Cimarex was adapting to this new environment and figuring out ways to survive and thrive in it. Our challenge is to adapt our business to be sustainable in this new normal.","There is good news to report. With the reduced cost environment and advancements in well performance, we have a deep portfolio of opportunities that offered very attractive returns. Regarding our plans for modest acceleration, we've been asked, why now? Isn't it more prudent to wait for the macro environment to settle out and recover? To that I'd say, we have no special insight on the future direction and timing of commodity prices. We view the world through a lens of greater return, and through this lens, we see the opportunity to modestly accelerate projects that offer outstanding returns, provide a cushion against further commodity downside and strengthen the foundation of the company as we look ahead into 2016, 2017 and beyond.","We have the wherewithal to fund these projects and are ready to go. Although we would enthusiastically welcome a recovery in commodity prices, we've always managed Cimarex with commodity cycles in mind. We'll survive and thrive through this one.","Finally, as always, our focus is on creating shareholder value. We are uncompromising in this focus. We have the organization and the assets to continue to deliver shareholder value through the cycles. As I tell our employees, we are building an ark, not a party boat.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John Lambuth who will provide additional detail.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our planned activity increases.","Cimarex invested $190 million during the second quarter drilling and completing wells. 66% was invested in the Permian region, and the rest went toward activities in the Mid-Con region. Company-wide, we brought 45 gross, 33 net wells on production during the quarter.","Our Permian operations are in the Delaware Basin, where we brought on 16 of those 23 net wells during the second quarter, meaning we have now worked our way through the backlog of completions we had built up at year-end. That backlog was caused by some severe weather in the second half of 2014 and in addition to a lot more activity overall. We had 18 rigs running in the Permian region at 2014. We then dipped to a low of two in the second quarter, and are now operating three rigs with plans to add more. I'll share some of those details a little later.","But first, we continue to have exceptional results drilling second Bone Spring wells in the Culberson White City area. We've drilled several wells using a larger, 15-stage completion with very favorable results, of which you can see in the presentation on slide 17.","Cimarex recently completed a 7,000-foot lateral in the second Bone Spring sand section called the Klein 33 Federal Number 5H. This well had an average 30-day peak IP of 2,753 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which included 1,870 barrels of oil per day. This outstanding well result gives us greater confidence that a combination of our upsized completions along with the extended laterals in the second Bone Spring can generate superior rate of returns.","Our long lateral program in the Wolfcamp D in Culberson continues to provide solid results. We have 30-day peak IPs averaging 2,255 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 11 long lateral Wolfcamp D wells. We continue to work on optimizing our frac design to both maximize IP rates while paying close attention to cost. As Tom mentioned in his remarks, optimal landing of the horizontal leg can be the key difference between a good well and a great one.","This is clearly illustrated by one of our most recent long lateral well results in the Wolfcamp A interval in Reeves County. The Big Timber 57-25 Unit 1H had an average 30-day peak production rate of 3,309 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 50% was oil. This well was drilled and completed in the Upper Wolfcamp A zone, the first Cimarex long lateral in Reeves County to be landed in this zone. We now have plans to drill a number of additional long laterals in this Upper A in order to determine repeatability of this very economic zone.","In Culberson County, we have results from our second downspacing pilot in the Wolfcamp D. As you can see on slide 15, these 5,000-foot laterals have strong 30-day initial peak production rates that average 1,340 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This pilot was drilled on 107-acre spacing, the equivalent of six wells per section. It's fair to say we've learned a lot from these two spacing pilots, and, when coupled with the data from the stack CD test completed in the first half of 2014, we are now ready to move forward on our first development in the Wolfcamp D.","As illustrated on slide 16, this will be a six-section development that would be drilled with 7,500 foot laterals, essentially four 1.5-mile sections of development each. Drilling will begin in January on the southern sections. First production isn't expected until early third quarter, as completions will coincide with the start-up of the recently announced MarkWest processing plant in Culberson.","We plan to drill 14 7,500-foot development wells in the Assault and Sea Hero 1.5 mile sections, bringing the total well count to 16 when you include the two existing current wells. These infill wells will be staggered in the thick D interval.","The two northern sections, which we call Sunday Silence and Silver Charm, will begin drilling in the third quarter 2016 with completion set for early 2017. As you can see in the wine rack illustration on slide 16, the Silver Charm 1.5 mile section will include an additional row of wells in the Wolfcamp C, whereas the Sunday Silence 1.5 mile section will test an increased density of 10 wells per section in the D.","As far as Wolfcamp capital plans for the rest of 2015 is concerned, we plan to start a six-well Wolfcamp D spacing pilot in Culberson County later this year with the rest of the capital allocated toward meeting our leasehold obligation in Reeves County.","Now on to the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling on the Cana-Woodford Row 4 infill development program late last year. Completions on this 57 gross wells covering seven sections has finally begun.","In preparation of these completions, we recently completed eight wells in the Haley Section with a variety of frac designs. Total sand pumped ranged from 9 million pounds to 12 million pounds or, put another way, 1,800 pounds per foot to 2,400 pounds per foot and we varied the stage count from 24 to 30 per well. As seen on slide 21 of our presentation, the Haley wells achieved a 30-day average peak rate of 10.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day with a 90-day average of 8.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day, very good results.","Based on learnings from these wells, we plan to make use of primarily a 30-stage frac design on our Row 4 wells and will pump between 13 million to 16 million pounds of sand or again the equivalent of 2,600 pounds per foot to 3,200 pounds per foot.","In our emerging Meramec play, we now have enough production data on ten 5,000-foot laterals. These wells have an average 30-day peak IP rate of 9.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day with oil yields that vary from 15 barrels per million to 330 barrels per million. Our first 10,000-foot lateral in the Meramec is in early flowback while our second one is drilled and awaiting completion. We plan to provide you with an update on these wells during next quarter's call.","In the meantime, we will be participating in our first downspacing pilot in the Meramec as well as drilling our first two-well stacked test in the Meramec, which we've actually commenced operations on now. Additionally, we now have plans to drill a stacked stagger pilot within the combined Woodford and Meramec intervals. All of these are critical data points as we think about development of this potentially vast resource.","In closing, I'd like to summarize our capital plans for 2015 and 2016 as we see it today. There are two slides in the presentation that illustrate this. First, on slide seven, you'll see our capital allocation for 2015. As Tom mentioned, we've added $100 million to our capital investment plan this year. This is really the kickoff to the increase in activity we have planned for 2016.","Slide eight shows how we see allocating capital in 2016. While we're haven't given you a dollar amount, we've based this allocation on what we project our cash flow will be based on the current strip, and then adding in the remaining equity proceeds of $630 million. The Wolfcamp and Woodford make up 90% of our 2016 drilling and completion dollars. While that may come as no surprise, the complexion of the Wolfcamp capital has changed, with about half of the investment in 2016 being earmarked for development drilling.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","Well, thank you, John, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'll touch on the usual items: our second quarter production; our Q3 and full-year production outlook; and then I'll follow up with a few comments on LOE and service costs.","Q2 was another great quarter for us. With little impact from weather or pipeline downtime, we proudly surpassed the 1 Bcf a day mark for the first time as a company, with our total company second quarter net equivalent volumes coming in at a record 1.026 Bcf a day. That's up 22% from the 839 million a day we produced a year ago and it handily beat our second quarter guidance of 965 million to 985 million a day.","Our guidance beat comes as a result of two areas. One, the strong new well performance that we should see in our completions. In fact, they way outperformed our projections, in particular in the Permian. And then, strong execution from our production group operating our base properties with their focus on minimizing downtime and optimizing production from the wells. And as a result, our Q2 2015 Permian equivalent production hit an all-time high of 595 million a day, up 202 million a day, or 51% from Q2 2014, while our Mid-Continent production came in about as we expected at 419 million a day, virtually flat to Q2 2014 which we reported 425 million a day. And we anticipated the production of Mid-Continent to hold flat as we waited for our Cana-Woodford Row 4 completions to begin here in late Q3.","As we've mentioned in our last few calls, with the geographic focus of our drilling program and the timing of our new well completions as we move throughout the year, we forecasted our early 2015 production growth to come from the Permian and we saw just that. Our second quarter Permian equivalent volume came in at a record 595 million a day. That's up 107 million a day or 22% from the first quarter, all the while setting new region record marks for oil, gas and NGLs.","With our Q2 Permian oil production of 48,448 barrels a day, up 12% over Q1; our Permian gas production of 189 million a day, up 26% from Q1; and our Permian NGL production of 19,169 barrels a day, up 46% of our first quarter volumes. With a significant production growth, Permian now makes up 58% of our total company equivalent production, and more impressively, 86% of our total company oil production.","As we also discussed in our last two calls, with fewer net Mid-Continent completions planned for the first half of the year, we've projected our Mid-Continent volumes to drop somewhat through mid-Q3. Our Q2 Mid-Continent production came in accordingly at 419 million a day, that's down slightly from the 444 million a day we posted in Q1. We're still on track with our plan, projecting our Mid-Continent production to pick up here in late Q3 as we bring on our Cana infill project. We completed just nine net Mid-Continent wells in the first half of 2015 as compared to our projected 30 net wells to be completed during the second half of the year.","As we look forward, with our strong Q1 and Q2 results, our current model projects our 2015 total company net equivalent production to be in the range of 960 to 980 million a day. That's reflecting 11% to 13% growth over 2014, and it's up from our previous guidance for the year of 920 to 950 million a day.","As was the case of our beginning year forecast, our projections reflect the geographic focus of our activity, with the Permian driving production during the first half of the year and our Cana infill project providing the catalyst for production during the last half of the year.","Our Q3 guidance of 920 to 940 million a day reflects our anticipated slowdown in Permian completions, along with approximately 20 million a day of planned Permian pipeline and facility maintenance here in early Q3, and just modestly, Q3 contribution from our Cana infill completion operations, which will begin late in the quarter.","With our current drilling schedule and the anticipated Q4 production contribution of our Cana Row-4 project, we project our Q4 2015 production rate to be up from Q3, with us exiting the year slightly above Q4 2014 \u2013 our Q4 2014 average of 949.5 million a day.","Jumping over to OpEx, Tom mentioned a little bit about this. We had a great quarter from an operating expense standpoint here in Q2 and that was really driven by both strong production results and our production group's diligent focus on LOE. Our Q2 lifting cost came in at a very strong at $0.76 per MMcfe and that was well below our guidance of $1 to $1.10. It was down $0.20 from our Q1 2015 average of $0.96 per MMcfe and down $0.32 per MMcfe from our 2014 average of $1.08.","We're extremely proud of the effort of our production group has put forth to reduce operating costs. Over the last six months, they have realized sizable reduction for items such as rentals, SWD, compression and well servicing, and our results continue to progress.","As we look forward into the last half of the year, accounting for a number of items including our Q1 and Q2 results, our forecasted production in Q3 and Q4 and the variable nature of workover expenses, we're guiding our remaining year lifting costs to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.05 per MMcfe, down from the $1 to $1.10 mark or range we quoted in our last call.","On the service cost side, with the slowdown in industry activity, we continue to see a somewhat soft market in drilling and completion costs, although we see our overall total well costs that will quote in this call, somewhat flat since our last call. We do feel that on both the drilling and completion side, service companies understand the importance of market share, which is helping to maintain a soft competitive market and perhaps more cost relief as we continue into the latter half of the year.","On the drilling side, since our last call, we've seen a majority of our cost components stay flat, all the while, supplier costs for tubulars have come down slightly. Day rates for idle, I'll call them top-notch rigs, 1,500-horsepower rigs, are more than negotiable today than they've been in a long while, down significantly from the rates of $26,000 to $27,500 per day quoted last year to levels today at $17,500 to $18,000 a day.","On the completion side, as we mentioned last call, beginning about February, we started seeing 10% to 40% decreases in all of the major frac cost components, whether it be sand, transportation, chemicals or service cost. The end result was that at the total company level, our average Q1 per well frac cost were down 15% to 20% from Q4 with us pumping an average 12% more fluid and 20% more sand. In Q2, we kept our average company per well frac cost in check while pumping bigger jobs yet, 30% more fluid and 16% more sand than we did in Q1.","The bottom line is today, we are pumping much bigger jobs than we did in Q4, perhaps 45% more fluid, up to 40% more sand, and we're pumping them at a reduced cost. The end result is we've kept our total well costs flat while pumping the bigger jobs, with current \u2013 total well costs \u2013 down 13% to 20% from where they were at the end of 2014.","Our current Cana Core 1-mile lateral well, Woodford well is still in the range of $6.7 million to $7.1 million with our larger frac. That's down approximately 15% from the $7.9 million to $8.4 million range we quoted last year. In the Meramec, as we continue to get more wells under our belt, we expect to see our current single-mile lateral wells fall closer to the lower end of our range of $7 million to $7.4 million, and that range is down about 13% from where we were in Q4 of last year.","In the Permian, our primary focus as we've mentioned this year is our long lateral development and the Culberson-Wolfcamp program. Our gain in drilling efficiencies are hitting the chart and market cost reductions have kept our 2-mile lateral cost in check, and we're running anywhere from $11 million to $11.8 million per well with our AFEs. That's down 17% to 20% from where we were in Q4.","So in closing, we had another great quarter. Our strong first-half results and operating efficiencies resulted in a nice production beat. We're proud to be over that Bcf a day mark. Our drilling program is generating positive results, despite the lower commodity prices, and we've seen some excellent cuts in our LOE. While the organization is focused in keeping our development cost in check, all the while we're optimizing our program results.","So, with that, I guess we'll turn the call over to question-and-answer.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Drew Venker at Morgan Stanley.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Drew.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Tom, I was hoping you could just provide a little more color on when we would get to that 16 rig program? Is that by January 1? And then if you can provide maybe just some bookends, general thoughts on volumes for 2016, whether we \u2013 should be accelerating growth somewhat similar to 2015? Could you help us there?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, partially, yes. The rig ramp we have, all that John commented on, were \u2013 we had a plan there to ramp up so that we'd be essentially at 16 rigs as we enter the year \u2013 but we're obviously working our development projects and it's a flux issue. John, why don't you comment on that?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. As Tom said, we're not talking, of course, single individual wells now. We're talking lots of wells that we have to plan for. I think our latest schedule will have us at 16 rigs right pretty much at the beginning of February next year. But that can slide and move forward just depends on how well we put those plans together. But that's what it will show right now as of today.","And then Mark Burford's here. I'm going to let him comment on production next year.","G. Mark Burford - Incoming Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Drew. Just in terms of production, with the fact that, as we mentioned, in the Permian, half our capital is going now transitioning from single wells, individual wells, and half our capital now will be going to infill development. And if you look at Culberson County itself, specifically the Wolfcamp D in Culberson County, three-quarters of our capital will be attributed to those infill development projects.","So, we had a major shift in the complexion of our capital compared to 2015 to 2016. And as we point out on slide 16 of our presentation, those two secs \u2013 that six-section development \u2013 the first completions don't occur on that until June of 2016 and the northern sections don't complete until the first quarter of 2017. So, we definitely have a mixture change in the complexion of our programs, so the efficiency \u2013 previous capital efficiencies probably don't hold true going into 2015 as we transition to infill development. And production is delayed in those areas and even in Reeves County where we have infill development in Reeves County. So, our overall Permian program, half of it now is infill development. So it does have the impact, the major production are more lumpy and more backend-loaded.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","This is Joe. Just a couple of comments there, too. When we have these development projects, depending on how many wells per section and how many sections, we won't begin completion operations typically until all the wells are drilled and completed. And Cana Row-4 is a great example of that. We drilled those wells all throughout the first half of this year. We're not going to see the production until the tail half of next year. To the extent that our development program becomes the majority of our capital expenditures, we're going to start to see this roller coaster type production profile that may not coincide with a January 1 to January 1 timeframe.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Maybe, so maybe just to make sure I have it right, due to the timing of completion in these big pads, does it make sense to think about 2016 as potentially a little bit slower growth and then 2017 probably much stronger growth?","Paul Korus - Outgoing Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Drew, that's logical. Yes. That's the way \u2013 yes. It's the way the development plans work. Yes. That would be logical, yes.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Drew. We're a strong growth profile. It's going to be lumpy, but I think that's probably fair. Our acceleration into 2016 is going to be quite a bit back-end loaded because of the nature of these development projects.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's all very helpful. And maybe we could just dig in on the Culberson County, Wolfcamp C and D infill program a little bit. I was somewhat surprised to see you're already going into development with \u2013 mode \u2013 with two zones and the Wolfcamp D. Can you just provide some color on how you settled on that configuration?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. This is John. A lot of debate, I would say, internally. I mean, what's nice is as I mentioned, we have those two spacing pilots. In addition, we have that stack pilot. We've incorporated those results. In addition, we have a lot of individual parent wells that have been landed in different zones within the D itself as well as the C.","When we take all that information, we come away with a model that would clearly suggest to us that we have plenty of room within the D itself to stagger and stack, which is what we intended to do to start with, and feel very confident with that initial design, again, based on our spacing pilot results and based on leveraging that \u2013 the 7,500-foot laterals \u2013 that we're going to achieve very nice rate of returns. The way this schedule sets up then is we will get those online; we'll get early production from it. If it's meeting our expectation, then that just gives us even greater confidence to move forward to even more tighter, as you see in those follow-up sections.","So, I would say that the two sections we call Sunday Silence, Silver Charm are somewhat dependent on the result of Assault and Sea Hero and that's why we built that schedule that way. But again, we really are looking at the results of those pilots and looking at our landing zone results from a number of other parent wells, and come away very convinced that this initial design is going to work very well for us in this interval.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I just want to remind you that this Wolfcamp is a really thick zone. And every play is different and has its own attributes. But in some plays, you worry about resource in place and the overall storage capacity. That's not the concern here in the Wolfcamp. The Wolfcamp is really a mechanical issue and what's the best way to poke straws in there, frac the wells and space them to recover it. So, we're \u2013 based on our experience \u2013 we're highly confident that this rock can support this development plan.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just wanted to clarify again, I know in the past you had done a C and D stack test. Have you tested two laterals stacked or staggered in the D as of yet or is this the preliminary test of that?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well, maybe I \u2013 let me just put it this way. I guess I would love that we go forward, that we don't even call it the C, D. We just call it lower Wolfcamp. Really, we don't \u2013 C and D is more of a geologic marker. What you really should think about is it being a very thick, over 500-foot to 800-foot thick interval, and that going forward, we're going to start with initial stack of two wells that we feel good about. And then based on results, then potentially add a third level to it with the next set of development. That's really what we're talking about here.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Drew, we have tested stack in the Wolfcamp A in Reeves County.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yes.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And so that the analogy is direct here and John is absolutely right. In fact, our technical team is discouraging us from even using the nomenclature C, D. It really is one large section.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for the color, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Gamble at Simmons & Company.","Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International","Hey, guys. Maybe we can jump to the other exceptional results for the quarter in either the Bone Spring or the Wolfcamp A, whichever one you want to tackle first. But I guess, specifically on the Bone Spring well, huge oil cut there. Anything other than the stages going up that you did differently in that well?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. No. That one made use of what would be equivalent of a 15-stage for 5,000-foot lateral. The difference being is it was 7,000-foot. It's just an outstanding well and it's just \u2013 it's a replication of what we've been able to do in other areas with that particular design.","I think what's exciting to me is we don't think we're optimized. We still think that there's perhaps still room to go with that frac design. And so, we do have further wells planned in the area to go in and test the limit of that design. So, it's just \u2013 the way I look at it is, again, a nice confirmation that we can take it and go a little bit longer with the lateral and still get a very good result.","Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International","So essentially confidence in the repeatability is pretty high. Is that what you're saying essentially?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","In this immediate area, yes, we feel very good about our acreage position and the well results there. Thus, why that was the first incremental rig we added was immediately to this type of drilling program.","Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International","Great. And then, same thing kind of on the Wolfcamp A, you mentioned trying to more landing them in the upper part of the A. Was this the first landed in the upper or was this just the first long lateral landed in the upper part of the A?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. This would be our first long lateral, but I will remind you that we did have our spacing pilot which was the ANACONDA which was a stacked\/staggered pilot where we had upper A and lower A. And right away, from those results, we could tell that that upper A zone was giving us superior performance to the lower A, even as you recall, we've talked about some issues with the landing the lower A. But even in the wells where we did not feel we had an issue, the upper A was clearly performing.","But I will tell you than when we plan this well, we had high expectations for it, to the point that we even worked very hard as a collective group to make sure our production facilities, everything was in line for this well, because we had high expectations and it's met those expectations. We've been very pleased with that well result. We have a nice, large, contiguous acreage position there where this well is. And yes, we have plans now to go and see if we can't duplicate this result with a few more long laterals.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But like the C, D, it's not either\/or. I mean that A is a very fixed section and I anticipate multiple landing zones in the development scenario.","Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International","And then, one last one from me, guys, the kind of extrapolation of your comment, cash flow plus $630 million and\/or using the 16-rig count. That puts your capital up, by my rough math, at least 30% next year. Is that a reasonable starting point year-over-year?","G. Mark Burford - Incoming Chief Financial Officer","Brian, this is Mark. I'm sorry, 30% what, increase in...","Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International","In total capital.","G. Mark Burford - Incoming Chief Financial Officer","Total capital from year to year. As you probably know, we constructed eight-rig program \u2013 actually it's based on a $50 oil price deck and a $3 gas price deck. And even at that price level, those price decks, we'd expect to have some remaining cash in the neighborhood of $100 million in excess at the end of the year. So, the $630 million, right now, the eight-rig program doesn't contemplate quite using all the equity proceeds. We expect to have some remaining cash at the end of the year and fund that program from cash flow. So, the absolute capital, we still would like to maintain some flexibility in that. But the eight-rig program at $50 and $3 price deck, we wouldn't expect to quite use all the remaining proceeds.","Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International","That's helpful, Mark. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Philip Jungwirth at BMO.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, Phillip.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, the Wolfcamp C, D development section you laid out in the presentation, I noticed it's focused in the northeast corner of your acreage block there in Culberson County. I know in the past you've talked about how the (38:00) you move west. So, as development eventually does move west and south, do you think this configuration of laterals and spacing is going to be applicable across the position or is it going to vary and can you provide some preliminary thoughts around that?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah, this is John. It will vary. I mean, as you pointed out, we do recognize yield variations, and that will have to factor into both our rate of return and PV calculations as far as the development plans. The overall thickness itself is pretty consistent at least on that entire eastern side of our block, and then we do thin a little bit as we go to the west, but not to the point that I think we would lose a row necessarily.","Again, I think it'd be more a matter of economics because, I mean, it is fair to say we do tend to lose our yield a little bit as we go to the west, but that would just be a decision we'd have to make at that time. I guess that would be how I'd answer it.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And I think you've talked also in the past about the C bench in Culberson being a bit lower return than the D or the A. So, is there a reason that the C's included in the initial infill development as opposed to a D\/A development? And then, can you still come back at a later time and target those A bench reserves?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. I'll take a stab at that, and I know Tom's itching to answer it, too. Let me just make clear that from our well results, the Wolfcamp A in Culberson is mutually exclusive from the lower Wolfcamp C, D. So we can come back at any time and layer in wells and, say, in these developed sections in A and not worry about any type of impingement on those wells. So, that we've clearly have established from our drilling program.","In regards to the C, D, it is fair to say that our well results do indicate that Cs tend to have a little bit lower rate of return, but we are fairly convinced that if we were to develop, we wouldn't need to do it all the same time. And so, that's why we have the plans you see there with those upper northern sections that we'd like to move forward with that and demonstrate to ourselves what kind of returns we would generate, and that full development pipe scenario, because I don't think we're convinced that we could come back and necessarily go in with the Cs at a later date. So that's why we're stepping into this the way we are with this plan.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The challenge here, as John mentioned, is we've really pushed our organization to say we want to take a long-term view of how we optimally develop this asset. And so to the extent that we can't go back later and get a layer, even though it may have a lower rate of return, we don't necessarily want to orphan it and abandon it for all time.","And so, we're making those decisions on a case-by-case basis, but we're really trying to develop this asset with multi-year look so that we don't find ourselves in a position five or seven years from now looking back and saying, boy, I wish we had done this differently. And so, that requires a lot of forethought, a lot of planning, but we want to get that while we can.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. And can you talk about the reason why the Culberson B\/D development is going to be based on 7,500-foot laterals as opposed to two-mile laterals? Do you think medium-length laterals are optimal for development or did this just have to do with the acreage configuration?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","No. This is strictly based on the way that our JVA was set up such that these particular sections were just three sections. So, for long laterals we have to divide it up in a section-and-a-half, nothing more than that. Our plans for the rest of the acreage is 10,000-foot. This is just a matter of just geography, just the way the sections laid out.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Irene Haas at Wunderlich.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Yes. My question has to do with the Reeves County, Upper Wolfcamp A. Is this a typical shale or are you really kind of looking for better porosity streaks within the Upper Wolfcamp A? And if yes, how continuous would the interval be?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. This is a \u2013 it's a shale \u2013 the Wolfcamp of course is a shale with interbedded carbonates. The way we see it, there is some definite variability to it but for the most part I would say, in immediate area from our well results, we tend to see some consistency in well results from section to section. So, we do expect some repeatability. When we make a good well in a particular landing zone, if we are to move a section over, our expectation would be that we would still be able to achieve that type of result.","As far as the Upper A itself, you know what, I'm just going to say, we do a lot of work with our rock data, our log data \u2013 and coupling that with frac design and well results \u2013 that help us internally get more comfortable with that Upper A, B and A an attractive target. And I'll just leave it at that.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","So what do you see in specific that makes these wells so much better?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well, to be honest, I'm not really going to answer that question. That's something we do internally. I mean, we work very hard with our technology to understand this, and so, I'll just sat be happy with our result and leave it at that.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Okay. I understand. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Smith of Bank of America.","Jason Smith - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning.","Jason Smith - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","So, on the Avalon, can you just talk about the tests you performed there and the results you've seen so far? And I guess, I'm trying to see if there's a significant difference, particularly between the 6- and 8-well sections, that you guys have tested?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. We did update our slide. For those who have the presentation, slide 19, although we didn't have comments in our opening remarks. But we're very, very pleased with the results from our pilots that we've drilled in the Avalon. And as we've mentioned, we tested a variety of spacing to help the Avalon. And I would just tell you that, on a go-forward basis, based on these results, we are very comfortable with eight wells per section within an individual bench. And in fact, see multiple benches as being opportunistic on quite a bit of our acreage.","So we're very happy and pleased with that play. As we've mentioned several times, our acreage position is HBP [held by production]. There's no obligation drilling we have to do there. And it's a really nice thing to have in our back pocket that if we need to, we can throw rigs at it at any time.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, I might add there that in testing and delineating optimum spacing, there's an approach that says, you test it until you break it.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","We haven't broken.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We have not broken it yet. So there is a debate that eight wells is not tight enough.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","That is a fair comment, Tom, that eight is a minimum at this point.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Eight or more.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yes.","Jason Smith - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Got it. So maybe, John, just to follow up on that, I mean, in your comments on HBP, I understand that. But your mix of CapEx, I think, for 2016 shows nothing at least at this point for the Avalon. Are you guys doing anything in the balance of this year? And as you said, I mean, what changes your opinion there? What makes you kind of go back to work and ramp in that area relative to somewhere else?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","I will say we do have plans for another Avalon test, where we're once again going to land with a pad well and test a newer frac design that we think could even leverage better rate of returns. And outside of that, again, I think it's nice to have that flexibility of having that acreage sit there because quite frankly, not everything goes as planned. And so, it's nice to be able to throw rigs over to it when we need to or more importantly, if we need to deploy more capital. It's sitting there waiting for us and that's kind of how we look at it right now.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Mike. So, the way it looks from my desk is, as we manage our capital expenditures and come up with our overall capital plans, these development projects take a lot of capital. And so, not every great project is getting funded. So, please do not infer from the fact that Avalon doesn't have a bigger slice, that it means that we're \u2013 we like it any less. So, it's just you prioritize and these development projects are our top priority right now.","Jason Smith - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thanks, Tom, I appreciate that. And on Ward County, I feel like I get to ask this question every quarter. Given the improvements you've seen in Reeves County, what, if anything, are you thinking about implementing there? I think you guys have mentioned where you have some HBP requirements in 2016. So, is there any capital going there or is that something that maybe you'd consider letting expire?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well, as of today, we've really not come up with a way to achieve sufficient rate of returns in Ward County. It's just as simple as that. We always constantly monitor; there's still wells being drilled there by competitors. We keep a close eye on what they are doing relative to frac design, landing, length of lateral. But I \u2013 to be honest \u2013 we just haven't been able to come up with the right recipe to date that makes that an attractive rate of return for us. So, unless we see a major breakthrough somewhere, there's a good chance that we will not be able to hold that acreage next year.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I want to just add to that, and Ward County is our poster child for why we want to do forethought on the development. Ward County, a lot of our acreage was developed in that Third Bone Spring; we had drilled horizontal wells prior to the ultimate potential of that Upper Wolfcamp being understood. Had we not done that, I think we would be developing Ward County. Had we not done that, I think we would be developing Ward County and we would be developing a Third Bone Spring in at Upper Wolfcamp.","The problem with most of our Ward County position is we're drilling into a depleted fracture network in that Third Bone Spring. So, it's not to say we're disparaging the Ward County, we're not. If we didn't have that Third Bone Spring there, we'd be having a whole different conversation.","Jason Smith - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","I appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question is from John Nelson at Goldman Sachs.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, and congratulations on a great quarter.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, John.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Also, congratulations to Mark in his new role, and I guess best of luck to Paul. For my first question, is you guys talked about transitioning into 2016 into a development program, I'm just curious if there's any guidance on how we should think about infrastructure spend, either over the back half of 2015 or as we move into 2016?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll let Joe comment on that specifically, but we're studying that long and hard. And there's a lot of issues around infrastructure with gathering systems, how you develop your facilities and how you handle your water sourcing and water disposal. And we're looking at the full-cycle model in trying to really optimize the return on these projects.","We're very wary of paving the future with gold bricks on infrastructure. We want to balance having the efficiency of taking advantage of the development and not overspending on upfront costs. So it's a bit of a balancing act and we haven't decided where we're going to land there, but we're trying \u2013 I will say this \u2013 we're trying to optimize our capital efficiency and minimize our infrastructure spending wherever we can. And Joe, you can comment on that.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","I think, Tom, you hit it right on the head. In many, some ways, it's a matter of where we develop in these areas. And a majority of the big dollar infrastructure items have already been put in the ground, our major trunk lines, our laterals and so forth. And to the extent these development projects lie along those existing laterals, there's a minimal amount of infrastructure associated with it. To the extent they're further removed, it obviously becomes a little bit more pricey.","So what, John and the midstream and the production guys are doing, they're working in concert to try and develop these areas in such a means and such a way that we're optimizing our capital spending. If you ask me for the budget we have this year, I would say, it'd probably line up pretty close to what we did this year with our infrastructure dollars, primarily because a lot of that is driven by compression.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And this year's number was $50 million to $80 million. Is that correct?","Paul Korus - Outgoing Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. In 2014, we spent about $75 million. This year, we'll probably going to spend about $50 million for midstream projects. So I would say, somewhere between last year's and this year's is probably a good run point for starting to look at 2016.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","It all depends on the timing of when we need compression. Compression's a big part of it. But a lot of that existing trunk line or what have you is already in place. But as far as an overall percentage of our total Permian CapEx, I would say, it's a small part.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And just to interpret some of those earlier comments, is that to say that you guys don't necessarily want to overbuild production handling facilities such that we might think about, especially in something like that Wolfcamp C\/D development area, some of those wells maybe being facility constrained early on, but ultimately, still having a positive standpoint, kind of a flatter, flat and longer production profile? Is that kind of what you're saying?","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","Well, we've looked at a number of wells. Our 7,500-foot Bone Spring lateral is an example of that where what was the cost to design for peak rate versus what was the cost to not design for peak rate. And it was a very valuable exercise to our team. So, we're trying to understand all the efficiencies that need to come into play and that give us a maximum rate of return.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But there is an argument for that \u2013 that it used to be in five or six years ago \u2013 the well was always the driving force. We would drill a well and we would build facilities in order to produce it at its maximum allowable \u2013 the maximum rate we could do. Today, where we have potentially 12, 16 or more wells a section, we're studying, is it better to optimize our facility size and then drill to keep those facilities full and at peak capacity. And it's a tradeoff, and we're modeling the rate of return to that very carefully, so that we get the greatest capital efficiency.","It doesn't necessarily do us any good to drill a dozen or 16 or 24 wells, build facilities for peak production, and then find six months down the road those facilities are underutilized. That would be very wasteful. And so, we don't have the answer on this call, but that's what our organization is hard at work studying, not only studying economic models, but we're studying our competitors very carefully, how they've done it, where they've had success and where they've had failures.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","And just to follow up on that facility, in this case, doesn't necessarily just mean the battery. It can mean the pipe size; it can mean the compression, a variety of factors that need to come into play.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful and good problems to have.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","It's a good problem to have.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Second one for me, I can appreciate that you guys don't want to give out a 2016 CapEx number. But just when I think about your working interest levels in those two areas you highlight that's getting nearly 90% of the CapEx, it can be kind of a wider or lower kind of band. Is the 2016 rig number, is that purely operated? Is that a minimum? Or is there some level of sort of non-op spend that you also envision happening in 2016, or any color when we think about sort of relating what's on that slide up to an aggregate number?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. This is John. When we quote 2016, that's 2016 operated. So, it's fair to say we definitely anticipate quite a number of non-operated partner wells in the Woodford as we always have. Typically, they've been running around six rigs here recently. So, that certainly factors into our capital model as well in terms of what they plan to do in addition to what we will do.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. I'll let somebody else hop on. Congrats on the quarter.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ipsit Mohanty at GMP Securities.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys, and congrats, Mark, in person. Just a quick \u2013 I couldn't help but notice comparing slides of 1Q over 2Q that you're Permian was a tad gassier than \u2013 in 2Q than 1Q. Could you comment why?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. I'll take a stab at it first. I think you're just seeing, number one, if I think about the different programs, quite a bit more drilling in Culberson and the Wolfcamp, especially Wolfcamp D. And so that does tend to be a little bit more gassier than, say, Reeves County or other areas.","Secondly, even the Bone Spring for us, traditionally a lot of our Bone Spring wells were more in New Mexico in terms of Lee, Eddy. We're still in New Mexico, let me be clear about Western New Mexico, White City and Culberson. They tend to be a little bit more gassier. But I will tell you, they're far better wells from a rate of return standpoint in terms of the type of productivity we get from those wells.","So, I think that's just what's driving that slow change you're seeing and getting a little bit more gassier. It's just where the nature of our rigs have been on that western side of the Delaware Basin.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Okay. And then, I think you alluded to this in a separate question. But when you look at slides seven and eight \u2013 2015, 2016 over 2015 \u2013 you said the Avalon would be missing because you have HBP and you have that description going into 2016. But when I look at Meramec and Bone Spring, two of the regions that you've highlighted in your presentations and seeing improvement, you see them sort of shrinking as a percentage of capital allocation. Is there something to read into that?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Development versus single well.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. I think number one, again, as we keep saying, when we go to development, whether it be Wolfcamp or Woodford, that's a major investment from a standpoint of deploying 17 wells or 20 wells. The Bone Spring itself, I think, from a capital standpoint, I don't think it's that much different from year-over-year. You're seeing just at our capital, the pie is bigger. We still plan to have a similar type healthy drilling program.","The Meramec, I would say, yes, it's going to slow down because we've reached the point where we delineated, we think we feel comfortable where we have good rate returns from an individual well standpoint. But as I said in my comments, now we need to understand how do we develop it. And so, we have a number of major pilots ongoing between us and our partner, spacing pilots, stack\/stagger pilots so we can better understand on our acreage how do we develop the Meramec concurrent with the Woodford. And so, that's why, prudently, we'll be slowing down some of the Meramec while we get those pilot results and understand how we move forward to get that acreage properly developed.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I also want to add that this is a snapshot in time, and we want to give you color directionally as to where we see the remainder of 2015 and 2016 going. But it's by no means set in stone. And, for example, there is a chance that in this Woodford development, we may have a layer of Meramec to add to it. And so, we may increase Meramec along with the Woodford development. But we're still working our way through that, but we wanted to give you our best read today on the direction. We maintain a lot of flexibility as we work our way through this.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","All right. Appreciate it. And then, seems like as you go over quarter-over-quarter, having followed you, it seems you've gotten very comfortable with the longer laterals across your asset base. Is going on from here, as you go forward the remainder of 2015 and 2016, what percentage of your drilling are longer laterals, just across Bone Spring, Wolfcamp and Woodford?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","I'll take a stab at that. This is John. Essentially, all the Wolfcamp is extended laterals, I mean, pretty much where we can. I think the lone exception might be the occasional pilot where we find that we can achieve the answers we need from a capital standpoint through 5,000-foot instead of 10,000-foot. But outside of that, almost every Wolfcamp well, if the acreage allows us, is an extended lateral at least 7,500-foot to 10,000-foot.","Woodford, traditionally, we have been a 5,000-foot lateral developer. But I will tell you, because of our comfortableness with drilling 10,000-foot, a lot of our future development plans that we review now incorporate 10,000-foot as our go-to for development. Now, that's not going to happen right away. But as Tom mentioned in his comments, we are looking at some areas, probably mid to later next year, that we will move toward long lateral development even in the Woodford. And again, I think that just speaks to something you mentioned. We're getting very comfortable with our ability to drill and complete and flow back those wells.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And we've taken a little different approach than some of our competitors. To the extent that we're delineating or we're testing spacing, we prefer to do that with 5,000-foot long horizontal wells, get the results a little quicker and spend a little less per well while we're doing experiments. In particular, if you look at our Meramec program, Cimarex \u2013 our wells are dominated by 5,000-foot wells. Many if not most of our competitors, have chosen to go straight to 10,000-foot wells. We're fairly confident that that was the right decision for Cimarex.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Thanks. Congrats on another great quarter.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jeanine Wai at Citi.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you built your 2016 program around rate of return given that you don't have a crystal ball on future prices. So I was wondering if you could just give us an update and rank in order of rate of return in your plays. I know in the current presentation you gave an updated 78% rate of return for the Culberson Wolfcamp D. So how can we slot in the other programs like the Wolfcamp A, Reeves A, Bone Spring, Cana Infill, et cetera?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. This is John. I think before I answer that, again, there are so many moving parts that go to building that program, that clearly, yes, rate of return is one of the first things we look at. But there are obviously other mitigating factors such as takeaway concerns, obligation drilling to hold acreage. So there's many things that go into that program. So, I just want to be clear about that, but rate of return is certainly one that we focus on strongly.","From a program perspective, right now, first and foremost, White City, Culberson, Bone Spring wells generate by far superior rate of returns, and we're very pleased with where we are with that program.","Once you step from there, the long lateral Culberson program, as you mentioned, is very healthy, looks very strong for us going forward, both in the A and in the D, which we've gotten very good results recently from the A now. So, we literally have two different intervals generating very strong results.","I would argue now with the latest results from Reeves, with the well we just spoke about, if we can continue to duplicate that type of result in that Upper A, then Reeves becomes extremely competitive relative to Culberson with that type of result.","And then finally, you get to Woodford, where Woodford, right now, are very, very good rate of return results. I think what excites us about the Woodford is what I mentioned earlier, when we start thinking about it from a long lateral standpoint. When we look at Woodford and we look long lateral, then those returns all of a sudden get to a point we get very excited about relative to, say, a Culberson long lateral.","So, that would be just my take on it, based on the current commodity price and what we see going forward.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And then, I also want to add and I think everybody knows this. When we talk about rate of returns, to the extent we quote a number, those are what's being called half-cycle returns. Those are drilling-only returns. They're not burdened by all the other things that make up a true investment profile. But there'd be incremental decisions that we make every day.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. That's all for me. Thanks very much.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question is from (01:03:42).","Unknown Speaker","Good morning, guys. Just a few on the Meramec, just wondering \u2013 there's, I guess, a pilot, doing an 80-acre downspacing test that you guys had an interest in, if you had any kind of feedback on that result yet?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. No. We have no comments to make about that pilot as of yet. We're carefully monitoring but no comments.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And then, John, I guess the location of those downspacing and stack tests in the Meramec, are those going to be in the up-dip or down-dip sections?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","They are in the up-dip, as far as the spacing pilot, as well as the stack test, they would be in what we have called the up-dip. Yes, that's where they're located.","Unknown Speaker","All right. And then just last one for me. There's been some talk about the variability of the geology in the Meramec across the play. Just wondering if you guys think that your acreage is going to be fairly consistent on the characteristics?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well, this is John. I would say again, to date, we've been very pleased with the results of our wells. But I will point out that we have 10 wells that go into our average. It is fair to say that of those three new wells, one of them was quite a bit of a step-out for us. And yes, it underperformed relative to the rest of the wells. That's what happens when you try to delineate your acreage. And so, there's no surprise that we have reached a point where at least with that well, we would start to think that maybe that particular area is not as prospective as others \u2013 from a 5,000-foot standpoint \u2013 let me be clear. We do recognize there's a variability to this, but I would also again point out that we've been pleased with the overall consistency of our results to date.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But the \u2013 John mentioned the three new wells \u2013 two of the three were choked back during a significant portion.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yes. So, to be clear, of the three new wells, one of them was a significant step-out that definitely underperformed relative to our average. The other two wells, just to give you a little color, are wells that are in an area that we consider very prospective. We upsized the fracs quite a bit on both those wells and because of that, we're trying to manage the flowback on those wells from a standpoint of both water and sand control. Those wells were conservative on their choke settings, thus, we didn't achieve the same kind of 30-day average rates that the other wells have. But we're very pleased with those well results, those two wells, based on what we're seeing to date.","Unknown Speaker","All right. I appreciate it.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to management for closing remarks.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I want to thank everybody for joining us. And in closing, I'm glad it was mentioned in our call, I want to congratulate Mark Burford on becoming our CFO. He's ready for the job and will just do a fantastic job. But I especially want to commend Paul Korus for the contributions he's made to this organization over time. Many of you on this call know Paul well. We're going to miss him deeply. It would be impossible for me to overstate what he's meant to this organization, to our shareholders, and to the building of Cimarex. It's with a lot of bittersweet that we let him go. We're going to miss him.","And part of the great contribution that Paul has given us is grooming and choosing his successor. But Paul's contribution is something that we're very grateful for. And I know many of you share me wishing Paul all the best and just deep, deep gratitude for the role he's played as a founder of this company.

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Karen Acierno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thanks, Phil. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Cimarex's third quarter 2017 conference call. An updated presentation was posted to our website yesterday afternoon. We will be referring to this presentation during our call today.","And as a reminder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings, news releases, for the risk factors associated with our business. We expect to file our 10-Q for the three months ended September 30 later today.","So as usual, we will begin our prepared remarks with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling activities and results from John Lambuth, SVP of Exploration. And then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on operations, including production and well costs. Mark Burford, our CFO is also present to help answer any questions.","And just one reminder, so that we can accommodate more of your questions during the hour we have allotted, we'd like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. You can always feel free to get back in the queue if you like.","So with that I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you, Karen, and thank you to all of you who are on the call today. We look forward to updating you on our operations and outlook as well as answering your questions.","Cimarex had another very good quarter. Production for the third quarter averaged 1,143 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 190.5 MBoe per day. This was slightly above the high-end of our guidance range.","Consequently, we are modestly increasing our full year production guidance to 1,134 MMcfe per day to 1,147 MMcfe per day, or 189 MBoe per day to 191 MBoe per day. 2017 production guidance has increased 5% at the midpoint since we first provided guidance in February. And our exploration and development capital is now expected to come in at $1.2 billion, the upper end of our original guidance given in February. This is a testament to the strong operating performance of our 2017 program.","We are achieving excellent returns on our capital investments. Our current returns on both the well level and total program are better than those we achieved during the halcyon days of 2013 and 2014, which were of course in a much higher commodity price environment. These increased returns are due to significantly increased well productivity, lower costs, and the growing capital efficiency of our infill development projects.","I'd like to refer you to a couple of new slides in our investor presentation to illustrate this point. I'll start with slide 9, which shows the improvement in productivity of our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp wells from 2013 to early 2017. Well productivity, when adjusted for lateral length, has increased 20% in that timeframe. We chose to show the average daily production per well for 180 days, instead of the usual 30 days, to give you a more complete picture of well performance.","On the next slide, we've taken a look back to the third quarter of 2014 at what our forward looking returns were at that time for a 10,000-foot Wolfcamp well in Culberson County. We've compared those to our current estimated returns for that same well type today.","We've used the same price forecast for both cases, $50 oil [per barrel], $2.50 gas [per mcf], and $17.50 (sic) [$16.67] per NGL barrel, all held flat for the life of the well. But we've kept everything else, well costs, production, LOE, drilling time, as it was or is in each appropriate timeframe.","For example, our well cost peaked in the third quarter of 2014 at $13.5 million for a 10,000-foot Wolfcamp well, versus the $11.2 million today. As you can see, the well level returns have increased dramatically for both the Upper and Lower Wolfcamp, again a testament to the productivity improvements we've achieved.","We've recently been on the road, speaking with existing and prospective owners and have been impressed with the shift in investor sentiment in the past few months. There is a consistent theme around fundamental questions about the E&P business model, the philosophy around value creation, living within cash flow, managing through the commodity cycles, and making sure that companies have executive team incentives that are aligned with shareholder interest.","At Cimarex, we welcome these conversations and the scrutiny they invite. It is entirely fair to challenge us to articulate our value proposition. Our mission is simple, to increase net asset value per share. We believe that the best way to accomplish this is to consistently invest capital at high rates of return. We account for unknown future commodity prices by stress testing our investments at draconian downside cases. Profitable investment of capital is our mission. Growth is a consequence of good investment decisions, not a primary goal.","Our corporate culture is based upon results. There are two primary ingredients to superior results, great assets and an organization that is capable of executing on complex projects. Cimarex has both. We define results by achieved rates of return measured by objective, transparent analysis of fully burdened return on invested capital. Half cycle or drilling only returns are interesting, but they do not reflect the actual return on the capital invested. Fully burdened returns account for all investments, land, geoscience, infrastructure, salt water disposal systems, and overhead.","Our shareholders do not see the difference between a 2,500 barrel of oil per day horizontal well and a company operated gathering system. It all boils down to a simple equation, capital in and cash flow out. Any analysis that fails to account for every single investment misrepresents actual returns.","Companies that consistently achieve good fully burdened, full cycle returns will have a higher return on capital employed, higher debt adjusted per share of production growth, higher debt adjusted per share reserve growth, and higher debt adjusted per share cash flow growth. Furthermore, companies that generate good results with these metrics should be able to achieve them while living within cash flow.","At Cimarex in a $50 flat oil and $3 flat gas future, we have the assets and organizational capability to generate double-digit growth and generate free cash flow as far as the eye can see. Results are what matter to us and results are what matter to you.","Let me make a few comments about capital investment as we end 2017 and look ahead into 2018. Although we're not prepared to give a specific outlook for 2018 capital, I can offer some thoughts on how we approach the opportunities ahead.","Looking ahead into 2018, more and more of our capital will be devoted to pilot development projects in the Permian and Anadarko Basins. We expect the Permian to get the lion's share of 2018 capital, perhaps even a greater share than 2017. John will walk you through some of the projects on our plate in both the Permian and Anadarko. We very much like both basins, but the Permian is currently more shovel ready for development than the Anadarko.","Cimarex is moving forward in our premier investment portfolio, our deep inventory, and with a commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet. We anticipate an active year in 2018. And as we have in 2017, we will manage our portfolio for continued strength in well productivity and fully burdened returns.","With that I'll turn the call over to John.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity before getting into some of the specifics of our latest well results and plans for the remainder of 2017.","During the third quarter, Cimarex invested $335 million on exploration and development activities. 60% of our third quarter capital was invested in the Permian region with 39% going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. We invested $280 million of the $335 million on the drilling and completion of new wells. Company-wide we brought 77 gross, 30 net wells on production during the third quarter of 2017, bringing our total net wells year to date to 74.","Our 2017 exploration and development budget is now $1.2 billion from the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion originally estimated with $900 million to $925 million allocated for drilling and completing wells. Driving us to the upper end of our original guidance was an increase in salt water disposal wells and higher working interest in our Meramec drilling than originally planned.","For the full year 2017, we plan to invest 61% of our capital in the Permian region with the remaining earmarked for Mid-Continent. We currently operate 14 gross rigs, 9 in the Permian region and 5 in the Mid-Continent. We currently plan to exit the year with 10 rigs in the Permian and 4 in Mid-Continent.","Now on to some specific well results. I'll start in the Permian region, where we have exciting results to share with you regarding a successful well in the Lower Wolfcamp in our White City acreage position located in Southern Eddy County, New Mexico. While we have drilled many Lower Wolfcamp wells in White City, this is the first 10,000-foot lateral completed using our latest generation completion design. This well, the Marquardt 12-13 Fed Com 4H (sic) [11H], had an average 30-day peak IP of 2,766 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 47% was gas, 19% oil, and 34% NGL.","This well's strong early time performance is helping us gain greater confidence and an ability to drill high rate of return Wolfcamp wells in multiple benches across the breadth of our White City acreage position.","Drilling has also begun on the Animal Kingdom infill development, which consist of eight 10,000-foot laterals being drilled from two pads, testing the equivalent of 14 wells per section by both decreasing the spacing in between wells and the bench, plus adding an additional landing zone in the top part of the Lower Wolfcamp, which is a zone we used to refer to as the Wolfcamp C. A wine rack display for this pilot can be seen on Page 15 of our presentation. First production from this pilot is expected in the second quarter of 2018.","We now have early production results on our Wolf \u2013 Upper Wolfcamp Seattle Slew spacing pilot, which consisted of six gross wells of 7,500-foot in length from two pads, which are testing the equivalent of 12 wells per section.","As can be seen on the cumulative production versus days plot on slide 16 of our presentation, the Seattle Slew wells after a cumulative production after 60 days is tracking with the 60-day average of the Gato del Sol and Sunny Halo's (sic) [Sunny's Halo] wells, which respectively tested six and eight wells per section. These early results are certainly encouraging. And we look forward to providing further updates for this pilot over time.","Finally, I want to talk about the increased activity we have planned in Lea County, New Mexico, for the remainder of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018.","Within our Red Hills acreage block located in Southern Lea County, we will be drilling two 10,000-foot laterals in the Upper Wolfcamp and three 10,000-foot wells in the Avalon interval in order to further test completion design.","Additionally, we will soon begin drilling a spacing pilot in the Upper Wolfcamp that will be comprised of six wells from two pads that will test the equivalent of 12 wells per section within one bench. We will also be spudding an Avalon spacing pilot, which will consist of six wells from two pads that will be testing the equivalent of 20 wells per section in a stacked\/staggered pattern within one zone. All these wells are expected to have first production by mid-year 2018.","Now onto the Mid-Continent, where we have some meaningful results to talk about. I will start with the results of our increased density infill in the Woodford Shale. The Clyde Copeland tested both 16- and 20-well spacing with 8 wells drilled from two pads. As you can see on the cumulative production versus time plot on page 23 of the presentation, early well results show production as virtually the same under both spacing scenarios and also compares favorably to the nearby parent wells. These early results are a nice confirmation that our completion design is achieving our predictive result.","Furthermore, what we are learning from this pilot will have a meaningful impact in the design for our upcoming long lateral development in the Leota Jacobs area, of which the exact timing is still being worked out, as well as future infill development across the rest of our Woodford acreage.","Finally, page 24 of the presentation highlights an emerging area we call Lone Rock, which is a Woodford play where we have over 16,000 net contiguous acres. After many years of testing different landing zones as well as frac designs, we have now honed into a well design that is creating some of the best after tax rate return drilling opportunities within the company.","The cumulative production versus base plot on page 24 demonstrates the dramatic improvement in production with the implementation of each new completion design. The three lines represent different vintage completions, with the blue line showing our most recent.","As was mentioned in our press release, the recently completed Hines Federal 1H-0235X well achieved an initial 30-day average peak production of 15.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day, of which 40% was oil. This well is a further confirmation that our landing zone and frac design recipe for this area is working very well.","With that I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll cover the usual items, our third quarter production, our updated 2017 production outlook, and then I'll finish up with a few comments on LOE and service cost.","As Tom mentioned, we had a very good quarter for production in Q3. Our net equivalent volume came in at 1.143 Bcfe per day. That slightly beat our upper end of our guidance range, which was 1.1 Bcfe per day to 1.14 Bcfe per day.","Gas volumes really drove our guidance beat, with our predominantly gas Mid-Continent Clyde Copeland project, which John just talked about, coming on stronger and a bit sooner than we had projected. On the oil side, we are right on top of where we forecasted the quarter to be.","With strong activity levels in both the Permian and Mid-Continent, we've seen nice production gains in both of the areas. Our Q3 2017 Permian posting of 628 million [cubic feet equivalent] a day is up 21% from Q3 2016, while our Mid-Continent volume of 513 million [cubic feet equivalent] a day is up 20%.","Looking forward, our current model has little departure from last call, with our late Q3 and Q4 completions in both regions projected to ramp our Q4 volumes. With the activity, we're forecasting our Q4 net equivalent production to range from 1.175 Bcfe per day to 1.225 Bcfe per day. And which would be an increase of 3% to 7% over Q3 2017 and up 22% to 28% from Q4 2016 and really providing us with a great springboard as we enter 2018.","Driven by Permian, the Upper Wolfcamp, and Mid-Continent\/Meramec completion activity, our fourth quarter oil volumes are projected to grow 32% to 37% versus fourth quarter 2016.","Incorporating our Q4 guidance, our full year 2017 production is now estimated to average 1.134 Bcfe to 1.147 Bcfe per day, up from last call's guidance of 1.12 Bcfe to 1.14 Bcfe per day and an increase of 18% to 19% year-over-year production growth over 2016.","With strong well performance during the year, we've increased our 2017 guidance each quarter. And as Tom mentioned, since giving our initial 2017 guidance in February, we've increased the midpoint of our 2017 equivalent projection by 5%. With this year's focus on oil and liquid rich projects, the midpoint of our current projection for total company 2017 oil production equates to 26% growth over 2016.","Shifting gears to OpEx. Our Q3 lifting cost came in at $0.62 cents per Mcfe, at the low end of our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70 per Mcf.","With that our year-to-date lifting cost also computes to $0.62 per Mcfe, that's down 6% from our 2016 average and 25% from our 2015 posting. Our production team is focused to maintain the reduced operating cost structure we worked so hard to achieve with a goal of keeping our overall lifting cost in check. As such, remaining year guidance, we've kept our previous lifting cost range of $0.60 to $0.70 per Mcfe.","And lastly, some comments on drilling and completion cost. In general, we continue to see stability in most all drilling cost components, including tubular and wireline cost, which increased earlier in the year. We did see some cost pressures in quoted rig day rates during the quarter, as well as some pressures on cementing ops in the Mid-Continent.","To fight any of the drilling cost pressures we've seen, we continue to keep our focus on efficiencies. As an example, our current median for days from spud to rig release for our 2-mile lateral Wolfcamp wells is running at 25 days, as compared to 29 days in 2016. And likewise, we've seen similar gains at our Meramec program with our normalized 2-mile Meramec drill time currently at 32 days, down from 40 days last year.","On the completion side, the per unit cost pressures in service and prop costs that we'd seen earlier in the year seem to be flattening somewhat. That said, we stay focused on refining our completion designs to offset the cost pressures we've seen to date, all the while concentrating on improving well productivity.","Completion and efficiency has become the name of the game to control our total well cost. We continue to experiment with fewer stages. We're varying the volumes of fluid and sand that we pump. We're actively exploring regional sand sourcing alternatives. And we're executing zipper fracs where we can to control our cost.","To ensure crew efficiency and adequate prop sourcing, we maintain a consistent number of frac fleets and plan our resource needs well in advance. As such we have not had any significant issues procuring the resources that we need, when and where we need them.","With our continued focus on efficiencies and some stability in per unit completion cost, we've made no changes to the well cost estimates we provided you last call. In the Permian, our current Wolfcamp 2-mile AFEs are running in the range of $10.5 million to $12 million. While still pumping larger fracs in our Bone Spring program, we've kept our current 1-mile lateral AFE in the range of $5.5 million to $6.7 million. In Cana, our 1-mile lateral Woodford AFEs are running $7.3 million to $8 million. And with our completion design changes and efficiency gains in the Meramec now taking root, we're maintaining our 2-mile lateral AFE range of $10 million to $11.5 million.","In closing, with Q3 coming in better than expected and Q4 projected to provide a nice ramp in production, we're forecasting solid 18% to 19% year-over-year production growth for 2017. Our focus on oil during the year is paving the way, with the midpoint of our total company oil projection equating to 26% growth over 2016.","The projected record production in Q4, with an anticipated 43 net wells either drilling or waiting on completion at year end, which will provide us with great momentum going into 2018. With production \u2013 with our production up, our constant check, and great returns from our drilling projects, we remain very confident about our program. And we're excited about our 2017 results.","So with that I'll turn the call open \u2013 over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, everyone. Tom, you talked in your prepared remarks about the capacity to generate free cash flow, while delivering strong growth. And just hoping you could speak to how you guys think about balancing shareholder preferences for overall more free cash flow generation? With the really strong asset base you have and the really high rates of returns that you can generate. Because it sounds like just those may be a little bit at odds or at least there's different pressures from different sides.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, thank you, Drew. The conversations have been fascinating to us. And I think there is certainly different viewpoints, depending on which shareholders you speak with.","I think our long term owners would like to see us invest our cash flow, make sure that we protect ourselves on draconian downside. We've talked in the past, we stress test at $40 oil, $30 oil. We stress test at $2.50 flat gas and $2 flat gas. And these are all NYMEX prices. And as long as we can achieve outstanding returns and we have protection well above our cost of capital, at a draconian downside, our bias is going to be to invest our cash flow.","Now we do pay a dividend. We cut our dividend last year, and we weren't very happy about that. We did it as a matter of necessity in a declining cash flow environment. In February, we'll reopen a discussion about dividend. And I think our bias is going to be to get that dividend back on a growth profile.","But we're not actively looking at any share buyback program. We're in the business to make good investments, as long as we're getting the kind of historically outstanding returns that we are in this environment. That's our business.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for the color, Tom. Just one follow up on the 2018 outlook. You guys talked about conducting additional spacing pilots. And I was really hoping that by this quarter you guys would have, I guess to use your term, broken the spacing across the whole portfolio. It seems like you just can't make that happen quite yet.","So as you think about trying to find the optimal design and development spacing and configuration, where are you going to be testing those limits? If there's any specific area? Maybe it's just across the board for next year?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Drew, this is John. I guess I'm kind of glad I don't have to use the word broken yet. But I think in some ways it's a testament that we're getting very good at being able to understand the overall resource in place we're trying to develop and understand what our frac design is doing. As I said, with the Clyde Copeland, the outcome we're seeing from Clyde Copeland kind of fit what our preconceived model said it should do. It's performing very well.","So in some ways I think we're very \u2013 we're getting pretty good for each distinct interval of understanding what that resource in place and what its full potential is.","Now still we're going to push the boundary. I could argue right now the pilot I'd mentioned \u2013 the two pilots in Lea County, where we're going to be testing much tighter spacing, both in the Avalon and in the Upper Wolfcamp in Lea County, that's probably tighter than anybody else has done so far up there.","I feel confident we wouldn't go out there with that design if we didn't feel like we had a chance of achieving it. But there is some risk that maybe we do break it up there. But I think it's also again, as I said, a testament that we're just getting much better at understanding what we're doing with these pilots. And how our frac is interacting or working in terms of the ultimate production we get.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Let me just add to that. There seems to be a bit of a nomenclature shift between \u2013 with the word pilot and the word development. As long as we're drilling pad projects, multiple wells off each pad, it's really development. And the fact that we're testing some things and learning along the way is a side benefit.","We're already achieving the capital efficiencies and the savings from multi-pad development. And by continuing to test spacing, continuing to optimize our frac design, we are extracting more value for each acre we own. And we're going to continue to push that envelope for as long as we're in business. I mean there's \u2013 so if you're looking for us to come up with a stamp that we can just replicate and put our curiosity aside, you're talking to the wrong management team.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Tom, and thanks, John.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Hi, Jeanine.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Morning.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. So my questions, they fall into the Mid-Con area. So in the Meramec, well, at times it looks like the [Leota] Jacobs development is probably deferred at this point. What size program could the Meramec footprint handle at this point in time? Or what size do you think would be prudent, given what you know or what you don't know about the rocks?","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","This is John. I will tell you, we're still working up our 2018 plans for Anadarko. And you're right, we still need to work with Devon regarding the bigger long lateral development, although I think there's strong sentiment that that Leota Jacobs will probably get pushed into late 2018, early 2019.","Right now we have quite a bit on our plate to still achieve in the Meramec. One of the big issues still is understanding what the ultimate spacing looks like in the Meramec. We \u2013 as we talked about a lot, there are a lot of pilots ongoing that we have an interest in, that we keep watching carefully. And then we our self are looking at several additional pilots that we'll probably be funding next year to again better understand what our potential is in the Meramec. That's kind of what our thought process is right now for the Meramec.","We're certainly \u2013 of all the plays we have, and Tom kind of mentioned this, the Meramec is probably the one \u2013 the least one where we're ready to go to any form of development, where we still have a lot of questions in both how many zones can we land in? How many wells per each zone? And even more importantly, what is the appropriate frac design? So those are some of the things that we'll be trying to address in 2018 within the Meramec program.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then my follow-up is on capital allocation. And maybe I'm just bringing the pendulum too far to the right here on this one. But how far do you think you would ever tilt the capital program towards the Permian, given however you frame operational risk from a company-wide level? Or your framework for just capital allocation in general? I think from an investor standpoint it oftentimes seems that the more Permian, the better for you guys. But I know that might not be how you're thinking about the program?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, Jeanine, we think about the program purely in terms of rate of return. And as John said in his remarks, this Lone Rock area has rates of return that compete every bit, heads up with our Permian. And some of the Meramec competes every bit, heads up with Permian.","So when it comes to capital allocation, we're kind of agnostic on basin. I know that there seems to be a real preference out there for Permian. But we don't really see the difference between cash flow from one basin to another, as long as the returns are there.","I think certainly, as I said in 2018, I think we'll have probably a capital allocation that's equal to or greater towards the Permian than we did this year. But that's \u2013 some of that's just about the evolution of the projects more than the returns. We like both basins. And we're not interested in being a one basin player. We think that the flexibility of the two basins really helps us manage the cycles of our business more effectively.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","The next question comes from Irene Haas with Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","Yeah. Hi, everybody. A question on Anadarko Basin, the Lone Rock project that's really exciting. Just wondering, in addition to the Woodford, how is the Mississippian looking for that specific area?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Boy, that is a great question. We are looking at that very carefully. In fact, we recently took a whole core through the Mississippian as well as the Woodford. We're aware of some outside operated wells nearby that look rather interesting. And so we our self will be testing the \u2013 what we call the equivalent Mississippian or Meramec interval sometime and early 2018 as well, and then we'll see what that potential is.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Scialla with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Morning, everybody.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Morning.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Morning.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Morning.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Wanted to ask you about the Pagoda pad, looks like you've got quite a bit of data there now. Are you comfortable with that data to kind of declare victory and use that as your \u2013 I know you want to push the limits. But is 16 wells per section in the Upper Wolfcamp Pagoda, is that going to be the standard or minimum I guess for that area going forward?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is John. Yes, we're very, very pleased with the Pagoda results. As you can see, we're almost 180 days into it, and they're holding up very well.","The only other comment I'd make though is that certainly that well design of 16 is very appropriate for the equivalent thickness or resource in place. So I can't necessarily rubber stamp over all of our Wolfcamp acreage in Reeves County. But there's a good part of it where 16 looks pretty good.","We are going to be testing actually even tighter coming up here soon. We're going to add a third bench and go a little bit tighter still based on the Pagoda results. So as Tom said, we're not going to rest on our laurels. We're going to keep pushing that boundary in terms of how many wells can we get in to that very prolific Upper Wolfcamp section there in Reeves.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","But I just want to add to that, that tighter spacing is adding another bench.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. Right.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","It's not necessarily tighter well in well spacing. And then I really want to underscore something John said. It's not a one size fits all, and this is particularly true in the Anadarko Basin, where our spacing tests are applicable everywhere however we look at thickness, we look at resource in place. And a particular spacing derived in one section of that play may not be appropriate for another, because the rocks may thicken and thin.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thanks. And you mentioned, John, the results from the 10,000-foot laterals over in Culberson look pretty solid. Is 10,000 feet going to be the goal there now? And I understand it's going to depend on acreage configuration. But also think you guys were talking about trying some laterals even longer than 10,000 feet. Is that something that's still in the works?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. Well, first comment is if the acreage allows us, then we are always a minimum at 10,000 feet in the Wolfcamp as well as any of our other intervals. That's our going standard length of lateral.","That said, we do have a lateral, because the acreage allows us to do this, down south of Culberson. We have some acreage that we're doing 2.5 miles on.","And, yes, there's still a lot of debate about whether we should go even further. I know our drilling department is very anxious to talk about doing that.","And again it's going to be a question of, will the acreage allow us to do that? There are places within the JDA. But we've talked about it. We're right now, because of the way the sections line up, we've been doing 7,500 \u2013 opposing 7,500-foot laterals. There are still areas there where we could instead go 3 miles with that section.","So we are internally talking about it. Like I said right now the longest I'm aware of is we're doing a 2.5-mile right now down south of the JDA.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, all.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Morning.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Maybe question for you, John. Just wondering on \u2013 the spacing that you showed on the Clyde Copeland, and I see kind of where that is. Do you anticipate sort of continuing to push that even further north? I'm just trying to get an idea of that greatest \u2013 that tight of spacing and how phenomenal that looks in that particular area. Could we see this as it moves over either to the eastern core or up to the Leota Jacobs? I'm just trying to get a sense of how \u2013 what the potential is for this type of spacing?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, we ourselves are looking very carefully at the Clyde Copeland results. We still have some more work to do with that pilot. We have what we call individual well strut-ins (37:29) we want to do. That really helps us calibrate our model in terms of the overall drainage area each well is touching.","And then from there, yeah, we will then sit down and look at the Leota Jacobs area, look at the resource in place, and then ask our self, okay, what is appropriate then for that acreage and that thickness, as Tom said. It's not a one-size-fits-all as much as it's going to be more what is the total age? What do we think we ultimately can drain from that? And then that would lead to the final design.","I think it's fair to say that it would definitely be more than the standard 9 or 10 wells per section that we've done in the past. I can just tell you right now we haven't honed in on the final number. But that's something we'll be working on quite a bit here in the coming months with our AMI partner, as we line up what that actual development looks like.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then, John, I know you don't have a full 2018 plan out yet. But with these details and the success you've seen both in the Del now and in the Midland now with the down spacing, does this make you more inclined to do much more, I guess, batch drilling next year? Versus just maybe two or three? I'm just trying to get a sense of how large sort of the average development will be next year?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, that is a very excellent question. It's something that we our self are asking all the time in terms of what is the best capital efficiency from a development standpoint? Is it a half section? A full section? Three sections? What works best for us? And that's something we're spending a lot of effort on.","One thing I need to make clear, no matter whether it's a half or full or whatever, all of them are from multi \u2013 are from multiple wells from a pad. There is a clear efficiency gain by putting a certain number of wells per pad.","Now we also struggle with, you may hit a point where you have too many wells on a pad. That's something we're looking at. But it's fair to say just about everything we do now is in mind where you're going to have multiple wells off of a single pad, regardless of whether it's a half, full, or is multiple section development.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. This is a complex problem. In fact, John and I were discussing this earlier this morning, because there's a \u2013 we get a lot of questions about, all right, when are you going to go into full development?","And that question suggests that full development is many, many wells manufacturing, let's say 50, 60 wells in a project. And that sounds good from a top line, because you can have efficiencies, you can have cost savings, you can have infrastructure savings. But the capital required for a project like that and the time delay between first investment and first production is also a significant consideration.","It may be that there is some optimum that's much smaller than that. I don't know if it's 8, 12 [wells]. I mean, we'll figure it out as we go. But again we view this problem through a lens of fully burdened rate of return, and that that includes first investment to first production. It includes parent-child interference. It includes infrastructure investment required. It includes production bottlenecks. If you have too many wells flowing into a system, you have to overbuild it to accommodate peak production.","And so there's a very, very complex set of criteria. We will view this problem in order to manage and maximize our full cycle rates of return. And so our engineers are hard at work on this. There's some good creative thinking going on. I had some discussions with our Permian team on this this morning. They're asking all the right questions. And I can't tell you today whether our optimum answer will be dozens of wells per project or something a dozen or fewer. It may be different depending on the area. John, you want to add to that?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","No. I think in fact I could argue based on what I see \u2013 Tom hit on it very well. Probably the bigger governing factor is not our ability to go out there and drill 20 or 30 wells and complete them, it's infrastructure, especially in the Permian. Your SWB needs, your compression needs, just all of that has to come into play. And you're absolutely right. On a full cycle basis, it does us no good to go out there and overbuild just to handle that peak production of 30 wells and then have that facility sitting there.","So we're giving a lot of thought to what is optimal, especially from a return on capital invested standpoint.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","And this is Joe. What I'd add there is, just from the simple example of the battery itself. If you had a nine well battery, and we drilled all the nine wells at once and turned them all on at once, that size of that battery is going to obviously need to be bigger than if you drilled three, come back later drill another three, drill another three. And that can have a significant impacts on economics.","So it's just all this balancing of everything Tom mentioned, John mentioned. And even on the facility side, the production facility side, it's a complex animal.","Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.","It's already happened in Reeves too, where we've said, okay, we want to \u2013 we've had a couple of small developments based on spacing that we've tested and where facilities are available and acreage is available. So we go in and drill with the pad. It may be a couple wells or three wells or whatever. But they're being drilled based on our results on these spacing pilots. So we're already applying it.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good. And thanks for all those details, very helpful.","Operator","Okay. The next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. First of all, I just want to kind of get some background color on this Lone Rock thing. I mean was this legacy acreage that you took another look at? Or was this a dedicated organic acquisition? And can you tell us how Lone Rock attracted your attention? And how long it took you to build your position?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is John. Lone Rock has been with us for quite a while. It was a position that we originally acquired in our early entry into the play. But early on the wells were very, very disappointing.","And so over time we keep going back to Lone Rock and we keep doing the hard work of trying to understand, why is this area different than other areas? And I will tell you perseverance really paid off in the case of Lone Rock. We saw the potential in terms of the resource in place.","But let me just say there's something else very unique about Lone Rock. It's an area where we have much higher pore pressure than adjoining fault blocks or areas next to it. And that in turn we believe is leading to much better yield potential. And quite frankly with our latest frac design and the lateral length we're drilling, much lower decline rates on these wells. So that's what's leading to some of these superior returns we're seeing.","But it was not been an easy a nut to crack. It's taken many, many iterations of both frac design \u2013 but I will tell you without a doubt landing zone has been probably the most critical issue in Lone Rock, because there's a lot of variability in the Woodford Shale vertically in this interval here. And our team has done a phenomenal job of understanding that and really honing in on where exactly we need to place these laterals.","Now that we've gotten to where we are, we're very, very excited. So much so that we've been doing our best to enhance our position. And that's something we've been working on over the last year or two years. Such that for the most part now at Lone Rock we pretty much operate the majority of that position. That's really where we wanted to get to, which is why we for the longest time have held back wanting to talk about it, as we go and did a number of trades to get us to this position.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. That was really great color. And then another quick question I'll ask is just looking at the slide on the Leon Gundy, it said that the next phase of work there was to work on the completion sequence tests. And just wondered if you could give a little bit of color on what exactly are we talking about here?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Sure. We recognize now that over a good part of our undeveloped acreage, especially in what we call Township 14 North Range 10 West, that we have the opportunity to co-develop the Woodford and the Meramec.","And what we are still working on is exactly how that sequence should take place. Can we do, for instance, Meramec only, and then follow with Woodford? Or vice versa? Or if we find that we cannot do it independently that because of a lack of let's say, frac-ed area, we have to do them all together, even in that scenario, what is the right order in terms of when you frac or stimulate? Do you do Meramec first and then do Woodford right afterwards? Or vice versa?","And those are the things that we're trying to answer. We're trying to be very deliberate about it, because as I said, we have a large, large amount of acreage that appears to have that potential to be co-developed Meramec\/Woodford.","So right now we have a number of two- and three-well tests that we've done that are just now flowing back that are testing that frac order. And we'll be watching those carefully to help better formulate our go-forward plans for that acreage block there.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And if I can follow that up and not get Tom mad at me at the same time. Because I wouldn't want to argue about development versus testing. These tests that you have here, when do you think that you're going to start to get an update? Or that you can maybe at least pick some sweet spots and really try to experiment with these developments you're talking about? Maybe pick an area and say, okay, we're going to do the Meramec or the Woodford in this order based on these tests. I mean when do you think it'll happen?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I think there is a lot of work being done right now to do just that as part of 2018 in terms of picking off a section or two and getting it out there and testing these things at a bigger scale. So I would just say just hold tight and wait to when we talk about 2018. And then I think you'll get a better feel for what our plans are for that.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from David Deckelbaum with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Morning, Tom, Joe, and John. Thanks for taking my questions. Tom, I just wanted to clarify your remarks. In your prepared remarks you said that the Permian could see a greater share of capital next year, because it's more shovel ready for development. Is that a comment around being more logistically ready for some more full field development or larger pads? Or is it more of a comment around geological understanding and spacing?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I think it's a little of both. But I'll just follow on what John said. I mean the Leon Gundy and the sequencing is a perfect example. We do think that it may matter which order you complete the Meramec and Woodford. And so we're just hesitant to march off and drill 12, 16, whatever the number of wells are on a particular pad project and get that wrong. We have some early indications that this may be a significant problem.","And so we're \u2013 you know, we don't have those complications. We're a little further along in the Delaware Basin. It's all to the good. I think the Anadarko is hard at work, getting these things ready. And I think you'll see us move into development there in short order.","But as we sit here today looking at 2018 capital plans, we think we've got a little further understanding of some of these issues in the Delaware.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I appreciate that, Tom. And I guess on the Lone Rock area, I understand some of the differences here with the sensitivity of the landing zone and higher pore pressures that you're seeing. I guess how would you contrast it I guess at a high level to the rest of your Cana play I guess on how you're viewing mix? I know it's very early on the spacing side. But I guess how do you think about this area generally? Or you just see it as a more productive or more saturated interval?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","I think that the way we look at it is, as I said earlier, it is an area of much higher pore pressure, relative to the depth you drill to. It's much better yield content. And because of a certain makeup of the rock, we see these much lower decline rates. And that just leads to very good IPs, but lower decline and very excellent well performance.","It doesn't carry itself across all the Woodford acreage that we see. But there are other areas that have similar characteristics. I could argue again part of Leota Jacobs I think has similar opportunities in terms of the yield content and the opportunity there. That's also an area of a little bit higher pore pressure, pretty good yield.","So in some ways I do see some of the things we're doing in Clyde Copeland translating well to Lone Rock. I will point out though that at Lone Rock, we don't have quite the amount of thickness as we do say at Clyde Copeland.","So as Tom said, I cannot directly take those excellent results from Clyde Copeland of 16 and 20 wells and easily translate it to Lone Rock. That would be foolish, because I don't have near the resource in place from a thickness standpoint. I'm probably more likely in to 10- to 12-well range, which is something we will be testing in that area here very soon.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Do you think that that area benefits at all from having less prior development around it relative to some of the areas further north?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","No. No, I don't, because basically we still have to drill individual wells per section just to get it to an HBP status. So it's not unlike anywhere else that we have developed Woodford. We always have typically an existing parent well on that section. So we're very familiar with having a parent well and understanding its potential relationship to future development. That's something we've been doing a long time here.","So, no, there is no drainage issue at the Woodford from a parent well. I can assure you of that, just given the tightness of the rock and the low permeability of it. I don't foresee that to be an issue at Lone Rock. It is again more \u2013 Lone Rock is very unique in its structural set up from a pressure yield standpoint that it's leading to the kind of returns we're seeing there.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks, John.","Operator","The next question comes from John Nelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I was just curious, what is the appetite for maybe paring some of your longer dated inventory? I ask because you keep seem to having success in getting more wells on the same level of acreage. I'm just trying to see if there is a \u2013 if it's being considered as a \u2013 asset sales are being considered as a way to maybe improve returns and unlock shareholder value?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, John, we're always looking at things that are potential divestment candidates. And we do have some things that currently are on our list to divest. They're more things that I would call non-core and probably not in the arena that we've discussed on this call. They're good quality assets, but for whatever reason they're just not currently a focus. So from a valuation standpoint, they're probably more valuable in somebody else's hands right now.","But in our core Cana play, in our core Delaware play, we're probably not going to be looking at divesting any time soon.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So I guess that sounds like more kind of normal course portfolio rationalization, as opposed to seeing the inventory as so deep that you'd potentially want to pull some of it forward by monetizing it?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, we're \u2013 this is not theology with us. In fact, one of the things that John has a new ventures group that's always working on new things. And one of the things I tell them repeatedly is success would be we find a new area that's so much better than what we've got that we end up shedding some of what we've got in order to let it be supplanted by new stuff.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","So, yeah, we're constantly looking at a refresh. And I appreciate the \u2013 just the observation that decades and decades of inventory is wonderful to talk about, but from a net present value standpoint, anything out more than 5 years or 10 years is not terribly high on net present value. So we constantly look at this. It's an open conversation here at Cimarex.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Oh, I'm sorry.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. I was just going to add one quick comment. I mean behind the scenes there are always lots of smaller deals going on, acreage trades where we're constantly enhancing our positions. So there are like smaller acreage blocks from time to time we will divest, nothing that's newsworthy. But it's always in an effort to get us to that nice contiguous block of operated acreage that gets us in a much better position from a standpoint of future development.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's fair. And then, Tom, I appreciate the very thoughtful prepared remarks at the outset on the E&P business model. As we think about maximizing returns, is there a level at which you would say the company is under-levered?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, many people would say we're there. But the experience that we've had the last few years has told us that under-levered is in the eye of the beholder.","And I will tell you that having lived through $26 oil, we were faced with many difficult decisions. We were faced with some tough days. But we were never faced with an existential threat of Cimarex. We always were able to focus on the right things, how to get our cost structure where it needed to be, how to make sure our assets could perform in a lower cost environment.","We came into this party with a lean organization and low debt. And our learnings from that are, both of those are good. So I don't think \u2013 I know from time to time we get criticism from people that perhaps are more financially sophisticated than I am on the proper use of leverage. But we're going to be in business for many decades to come. And staying low levered is a pretty good insurance against commodity fluctuations. Mark, do you want to comment on that?","G. Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah, John. I guess I'd comment that right now our debt to EBITDA ratio, the ending \u2013 trailing 12-month third quarter is 1.4 times. We've talked openly in the past that 1.5 times or less is probably an objective that we want to maintain. And we're there now.","But I just \u2013 as Tom mentioned, the volatility in the cash flows were \u2013 kind of keep approaching our target rate or a little less, and that's we want to see that 1.5 times debt to EBITDA or less. And as we go into the future years, we see that decreasing further as our EBITDA is growing. But it is the conversation that we have in the future is that as our EBITDA grows, and whether or not we'd want to use more leverage or not?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, yes. It's the debt metrics we look at.","G. Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.","Right.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Not the actually \u2013 the debt level.","G. Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.","That's right.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","But, John, let me say this. And we get asked this a lot. We've looked at a number of opportunities to purchase assets over the last few years. And we haven't found anything that we've pulled the trigger on. But we're always looking.","If we found something that we thought had long term strategic value and that we could get really good full cycle fully burdened returns through that transaction, and it involved a higher degree of leverage than we've historically operated at, we would consider that seriously.","So if we temporarily went into a period where we had higher leverage, we'd probably look at a much more aggressive hedging program to protect ourselves. But this \u2013 our balance sheet is a tool. And we recognize that. And we'd be prepared to use it.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Very thoughtful. I appreciate that again. I'll let somebody else hop on. Congrats on the quarter, guys.","G. Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. The final question comes from Matt Portillo with TPH. Please go ahead.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Morning.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Morning.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Morning.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","John, just a quick question. Noticing some Bone Spring wells starting to pop up on your map in the Northern Delaware Basin. And just curious...","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","...how you guys are looking at that delineation program, as your results and also peers seem to be having some success? And then heading into 2018, could this become a larger development for you at this point?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. We are continuing as we always are to drill the occasional Bone Spring well. And we have quite a number we're doing. In fact \u2013 well, just in general, I will tell you just in the fourth quarter alone, the combination of Bone Spring, Avalon, and Wolfcamp, we'll drill 13 wells in Lea County, gross wells in the fourth quarter. And quite a few of those will be Bone Spring wells, both Second and Third Bone Spring. And you'll see us occasionally drilling more of those during the course of next year.","It's just \u2013 it's a very nice complement to our overall program. I don't know. You could maybe envision a half to a full rig's worth of drilling across the entire breadth of the year that we will scatter in.","And yes, what we \u2013 one other comment I'll make is, based on other operators' results, it is kind of redefining now what we see as perspective. Whereas before we maybe \u2013 we may have high graded to a point. We said there wasn't much left to do on our existing position. I cannot say that anymore. And that we definitely see more potential in our acreage. And you'll be seeing us drill more of those wells in the coming year.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. And then as my second follow-up. You drilled two wells this year in Ward County, targeting the Wolfcamp. Just any updated thoughts on the results so far? And how you guys are thinking about that part of your portfolio going forward?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. We have drilled two. We have another one coming up. And we're still monitoring results.","Ward is one \u2013 I kind of \u2013 I'm not \u2013 sometimes I think of Ward like what I talked about with Lone Rock and that \u2013 what I mean by that is, we see great resource potential there. We just haven't fully cracked the nut so to speak in terms of perfecting returns there. I see the potential.","The overhang we have is of course the existing Third Bone [Spring] production and drilling we did many, many years back. And what its interaction or interplay is to the current drilling we're doing now.","That said, I still see a lot of resource potential there, even when I account for those existing wells. We're just trying to figure out \u2013 again kind of like Lone Rock \u2013 where is the best place to land those wells and frac them to bring them to a level or rate of return profile that they will start \u2013 compete with the other programs for capital. So that's where we are right now with that program.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, today's event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Karen Acierno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thanks, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Cimarex second quarter 2018 conference call. As I'm sure, you saw an updated presentation was posted to our website yesterday, we will be referring to this presentation during our call today.","As a reminder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements on our news release in our latest 10-Q for the three months ended June 30 which was filed yesterday and our 10-K and other filings for the risk factors associated with our business.","As always, we will begin our prepared remarks with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling activities, and results from John Lambuth, SVP of Exploration. And then Joe Albi, COO, will update you on operations, including production and well costs. Our CFO, Mark Burford, is here to help answer any questions.","So that we can accommodate more of your questions during the hour we have allotted, we'd like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, and then feel free to get back in the queue if you like.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you, Karen, and thank you to all who are joining us on the call this morning. Cimarex had a very good second quarter. We invested $375 million in exploration and development activities. Our net daily average production was 211,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was above the high-end of our guidance.","We are on track to deliver solid production performance during the second half of 2018 with a strong production ramp that will result from our Q3 and Q4 well completions. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for the Ward County sale, we project total production to increase 16% year-over-year with oil production set to increase 23% year-over-year. Furthermore, we projected our Q4 2018 oil production will increase 33% to 43% over Q4 2017.","We reported adjusted net income of $152 million for the second quarter or $1.59 per share. We brought 23 high-rate wells online during the quarter. We are continuing to deliver a very good year in terms of return on invested capital. Our Permian and Anadarko Basin programs are both performing well despite some strong headwinds. These include widened basis differentials and modest cost inflation. We will comment more about these later in the call.","As most of you know, we manage Cimarex through a lens that focuses on return on invested capital. We do not manage around growth targets nor do we manage around commodity preference. We invest capital with fully burdened rate of return as the guiding hand. We incorporate projected basis differentials and projected inflation in our go-forward capital allocation decisions. We also compare our opportunities to invest in our business against capital return opportunities and other options, all with a focus on delivering strong value to our shareholders. We built the company with this discipline and it guides all of our decisions.","During the quarter, we announced the sale of our Ward County assets for $570 million. We are on track to close August 31. We expect to reinvest these proceeds in our business over the next two or three years which we believe will maximize returns to Cimarex shareholders. We're not making any changes to our 2018 CapEx as previously announced.","As we look ahead into 2019, we will time any acceleration in our Permian program so that flush production takes place in the second half of the year when Midland-Cushing differentials should narrow as new oil pipelines come online. Getting this right could have a significant impact on our cash flow and on our returns. We will also remain opportunistic for asset purchases or consolidation opportunities that make sense.","We will keep you posted as our 2019 plans unfold. As always, our board will continue to debate our strategy and tactics as conditions change all with a view on delivering sustained shareholder value. Cimarex has established a long history of returns based management, conservative balance sheet management, transparency in our communication with the investment community and focus on value.","Our business is performing well. We are seeing excellent returns across our portfolio. We have the economies of scale to deliver increasing capital efficiency and maintain an industry-leading cost structure. Furthermore, we have great confidence that our assets and organization makes these results highly repeatable. We are well positioned for the environment ahead with decades of high quality inventory. We can compete with the best.","As Joe will describe, we have seen some modest cost inflation during the year. Although it is less than we had forecast at beginning of the year, it has our attention. We are focusing on lowering our cost structure across the board. This includes drilling costs, completion costs, facilities costs, lease operating costs and the infrastructure costs associated with gathering and saltwater disposal. As always, Cimarex reports actual costs not target costs.","During the call today, John Lambuth and Joe Albi will update you on some projects that are in various stages of completion. We are flowing back a number of development projects that are meaningful to us in making future development decisions. These include our Hallertau Wolfcamp development in Eddy County, New Mexico; our Snowshoe project in Reeves County, Texas; our Animal Kingdom development in Culberson County, Texas; our Shelly Woodford Shale development in Canadian County, Oklahoma; and our Steve O Meramec development in Kingfisher County, Oklahoma.","In closing, what can you expect from Cimarex during the remainder of the year? We will continue to focus on well improvement, overall cost reduction, and optimal development design. More and more of our capital program will shift to multi-well, multi-pad development projects. We do not subscribe to any single philosophy on optimum development. Optimal development is a function of the investment capital cycle, reservoir interference, and facility design requirements. There is an inherent tension between optimizing rate of return and optimizing net present value when choosing the right project size. The right answer is partially dependent upon the quality of other opportunities within a portfolio.","We don't subscribe to a one-size-fits-all approach. On these and all projects, we measure ourselves in a transparent, brutally objective manner. We occasionally stumble, but we adapt and innovate and improve.","We're committed to exercise sound financial discipline and to be responsible to our shareholders. This includes a commitment to deliver top-tier fully burdened returns, maintain a strong balance sheet, and grow our dividend over time. We are also committed to clear credible communication on calls like this one. And, yes, we still explore at Cimarex. We are constantly on the hunt for assets that can augment our top-tier portfolio either in our existing basins or beyond. The bar is high, but we are continuously looking for new opportunities and bolt-on acquisitions. Continuous improvement is alive and well at Cimarex. Our goal is continuous, disciplined, profitable growth.","With that, I will turn the call over to John for additional detail.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thanks, Tom. During the second quarter, Cimarex invested $375 million in exploration and development activities, of which $322 million was invested in the drilling and completion of new wells. Year-to-date, 61% of our drilling and completion capital was spent in the Permian region and 39% in the Mid-Continent. We brought 23 net wells on production during the quarter and are currently operating 13 gross rigs with 10 in the Permian region and three in Mid-Continent. We currently have six completion crews working across our acreage.","Now on to some specifics about each region, in the Permian, we brought 13 net wells online during the second quarter including 6 wells in the Hallertau project, an Upper Wolfcamp spacing test in Lea County, New Mexico. These six 5,000-foot wells achieved a 30-day peak average rate of 1,295 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 783 was barrels of oil per day. This spacing pilot was designed to test 12 wells per section in the Wolfcamp A, with three of the wells landed in the upper most part of the A, an interval known as the Y sand, with additional two wells which were landed 50 feet below these wells in the Upper A shale, and the sixth well which was landed 225 feet directly below one of the Y sand wells. I will refer you to slide 39 of our slide deck for a wine rack view of this development.","While we think 12 wells is the right number of wells for this section, after 90 days of production, we have observed a decline in the performance related to the five wells landed in the upper most part of the interval. Analysis of the production data show that the vertical separation between these two benches was too small, thus causing more rate-sharing than anticipated. The sixth well in this pilot is meeting our pre-drill expectations which, in short, corroborates the conclusion that 12 wells per section is optimal, given sufficient vertical spacing between the benches.","Also, on the Wolfcamp section, we have two spacing tests in various stages of completion. In Culberson County, the Animal Kingdom infill development, which consists of eight 10,000-foot laterals in the Lower Wolfcamp, will be finished with their frac operations by the end of August. These wells are testing the equivalent of 14 wells per section by both decreasing the spacing between wells and the bench, plus adding additional landing zone in the top part of a Lower Wolfcamp, a zone that we used to refer to as the Wolfcamp C. These wells are planned to be on production by mid-September.","Another important test in the Upper Wolfcamp located in Reeves County is the Snowshoe pilot where the first pad of three 10,000-foot wells are now producing. And the second pad with remaining five wells will be on production by mid-August. You may recall these wells are testing the equivalent of 18 wells per section. Stay tuned for results on these development projects later this year.","Now, onto the Mid-Continent, completion operations are finished on the Meramec Steve O development project which consists of six 10,000-foot laterals stacked\/staggered in two benches. This pilot, which is currently flowing back, is testing the equivalent of eight wells per section spacing. We have now also begun drilling on three additional Meramec development projects across our acreage position with first production not expected from these projects until early 2019.","Another interesting well brought on production this quarter in the 14 North-10 West area was the Gresham Com 1H-1819X. This well is directly south of the recently announced Mike Com well and had an initial 30-day rate of 5,813 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 8% was oil, 31% NGL, and 61% gas. This well is a further confirmation of the strong production rates capabilities of the Meramec section across the 14 North-10 West area, and reinforces the kind of high after-tax rate of return development opportunities within the Meramec and Woodford section that Cimarex operates and the 14 North-10 West position.","In the Woodford Lone Rock area, completion operations are finished with initial flow back underway on the Shelly spacing pilot. Furthermore, a second Lone Rock development project called JD Hoppinscotch is also finished with its completion and has initial flowback expected to begin by the middle of this month.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, thank you, John, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'll give you an update on the usual items, our second quarter production, our revised full-year production guidance, and then I'll finish up with a few comments on Permian takeaway as well as Mid-Continent takeaway, LOE, and then service costs.","With reported net daily equivalent production of 211,000 BOEs per day, we had another solid quarter in Q2. The mark put us above the upper-end of our guidance range of 200,000 to 209,000 BOE per day and, once again, set a new record for the company.","With our Q2 oil volume coming in about as we had internally modeled, our guidance beat was driven primarily by higher than forecasted NGL volumes. Stronger Permian NGL prices boosted the increase and drove our total company NGL production to a record 59,900 barrels per day, that's a 16% increase over first quarter. And as a result, our equivalent production ended up 3% higher than Q1 2018 and 10% over where we were in Q2 2017.","We had limited completion activity during the second quarter. Our Q2 oil volumes came in at 61,651 barrels a day, that was on track with where our internal projections were pointing, and up 7% over Q2 17.","We continue to see nice year-over-year production gains in both Permian and the Mid-Continent with our Q2 Permian equivalent posting of 121,700 BOEs per day, up 13% over Q2 2017, and our Mid-Continent volume of 88,900 BOE per day, up 5% from a year ago. Higher than projected NGL recoveries drove our reported Q2 Permian NGL volume to a record 32,865 barrels a day, that's up 33% from first quarter and 31% from Q2 2017.","With the back end loading of our well completions this year, our Q2 Permian oil volume of 48,800 barrels per day was down just slightly from Q1 but was up 6% over Q2 2017. And likewise, our Q2 Mid-Continent oil volume of 12,500 barrels a day was down about 2,700 barrels a day from Q1, but again up 5% from our second quarter posting last year.","So, with Q2 in the books, some slight shifting in the timing of our anticipated completion activity, and revised NGL recovery projections, we've increased the midpoint and tightened the band of our full-year guidance projection to 214,000 to 221,000 BOEs per day, and that's despite the sale of our Ward County properties, which, Tom alluded to, is scheduled to close at the end of this month.","We have seven operated and three non-operated multi-well pilot projects scheduled to come online in late Q3 and into Q4. 70% of our full-year completion activity is planned for the second half of the year. And as such, we're projecting a total of 86 net completions in the second half of the year as compared to 38 in the first half of the year, with 49 of the remaining 86 net wells forecasted to come on in Q3. And with that, we're projecting the same steep production ramp from September and into December that we described last call. To put the completion ramp into perspective, we're projecting more net completions in August and September than we completed in the entire first six months of the year.","And with the ramp, we're estimating our Q4 oil volumes of 75,000 to 80,000 barrels a day to be up 33% to over 40% based on a sale adjusted Q4 2017 oil volume of 56,500 barrels a day. With our current forecast, we're guiding Q3 net equivalent volumes to land in the range of 206,000 to 215,000 BOE per day, with our forecasted late year production ramp resulting in a full-year guidance range of 214,000 to 221,000 BOE per day. That's a 14% to 18% increase over 2017 after adjusting for the sale of our Ward County assets.","A few update words on Permian takeaway. Our marketing team continued their efforts during the second quarter to ensure our oil, gas, and NGLs move out of the Permian Basin. On the gas side, we've now agreed to terms for the sale of 98% of our projected Permian residue gas volumes through December of 2019, while extending sale terms for 84% of our projected volumes through the first quarter of 2020.","As we mentioned last call, our NGL production is linked to numerous processing facilities across the basin and with whom we've either purchaser-backed, firm or established long-term sale arrangements in place. And on the oil side, 70% of our Permian oil is on pipe with strategic partnerships and oil agreements in place to ensure flow through 2019 and beyond. That said, we continue to evaluate all options to ensure long-term flow of all products out of the basin.","And although Permian takeaway is a strong focal point of the market, we remain equally concentrated on the Mid-Continent, evaluating all means to ensure near- to long-term takeaway for our forecasted Mid-Continent volumes. As we've discussed before, our goal in both the Permian and Mid-Continent is to ensure product flow. On a realized price basis, however, we will still be exposed to the El Paso and Waha basis differentials in the Permian and the Panhandle, Ann Arr (00:20:25), and OGT differentials in the Mid-Continent.","Shifting gears to OpEx, our Q2 lifting costs came in at $4.12 per BOE, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance of $3.80 to $4.30 per BOE. We continue to see similar cost pressures to those that we saw in Q1, particularly in items such as SWD, compression, contract labor, and rentals. With the closing of our Ward County sale in late Q3, we're maintaining our remaining year lifting cost guidance range of $3.80 to $4.30 per BOE. And we're projecting that we'll be pushing the low-end of that guidance range as we enter into Q4 with the Ward assets no longer on the books.","And lastly, some comments on drilling and completion cost. On the drilling side, we're beginning to see more real significant cost pressure. Tom alluded to this. We're seeing 10% to 20% cost increases in items such as day rates and surface and downhole rentals. And at the same time, we're starting to see the steel tariffs work their way into our AFEs with us rolling off our pre-tariff inventory of pipe and equipment. We've been able to offset a portion of these increases with drilling efficiencies, an example being in our Meramec program where we've reduced our median time from spud to TD for a 2-mile lateral wells from 36.5 days in 2017 to 24.2 days here in the first half of 2018.","On the completion side, we're seeing cost pressures in wireline services and transportation, which we continue to fight with operational efficiencies and our initiation of local sand sourcing in the Permian, which we began in May. So as a result, when you put it all together, we've been able to offset both the drilling and completion cost inflation with operational and resource sourcing efficiencies and, in essence, have been able to keep our total well cost in check.","In the Permian, depending on area, interval, facility design and frac logistics, our current Wolfcamp 2-mile AFEs continue to run in the $11 million to $13.5 million range. Our deeper 1-mile New Mexico Bone Spring AFEs in northern Eddy and Lea Counties are flat with last quarter with a range of $7 million to $8.5 million. In our Lone Rock area, our 1-mile Woodford AFEs continue to run $7.5 million to $8 million. And as we continue to gain efficiencies and experiment with completion design, we've widened the range for our 2-mile Meramec AFEs to $11.5 million to $13 million with the midpoint that's basically in line with the $11.8 million to $12.8 million range that we quoted last call.","So in closing, we had a solid Q2, higher than anticipated NGL recoveries drove our quarterly guidance beat, and our revised forecast results in a full-year production guidance increase despite the sale of our Ward County assets. With 49 net completions timed for Q3, we continue to forecast sizable oil growth in Q4 with sale adjusted Q4 oil volumes projected to be 33% to 43% over Q4 2017. Our lifting and development costs remain in check and we stay focused on ensuring near- and long-term takeaway for all of our produced products, all the while our drilling projects are generating favorable returns for our program.","So, with that, I'll turn the call over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Unknown Speaker","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Today's first question comes from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. I was hoping...","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Hi. Drew.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","... if you could speak to the key drivers of the production volumes in the second half with that big ramp in completions and could we potentially see peak production from that big ramp in completions in first quarter and not fully see it later this year?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, Drew, I'll answer that question. What we're going to end up seeing is the ramp starting in September and really starting to materialize itself as you get into November and December. As far as what we're talking about for 2018, we're still going to be increasing according to our modeling our equivalent oil production as we enter into December.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","These wells come on, they take a little bit of time to clean up and they're multi-well pads. So, they're all coming on at once and they're all cleaning up at once, and they're all going to ramp at once.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And are you operating the number of frac spreads you need achieve these completions already?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. We've got five work in the Permian and one working in the Mid-Continent, and we bumped that about a month and a half ago just to accommodate these completion forecasts.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Drew, this is John Lambuth. To add a little more to what Joe just said. Of all of those pads, there's really only one major development left to be actually completed which is Triste Draw. All the others, for the most part, have been completed or just about done with completion with a number of them already were drilled out and starting to flow back. So, operationally, everything's gone very well from the standpoint of the timing and getting these wells on as we expected to come on. So, that's why I think we're fairly confident in the projections we put forward.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Appreciate that additional detail. Just one more on operations as a follow up. From what you've seen so far this year, can you speak to which areas have been outperforming your expectations and which haven't performed as well?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is John. There are a number of places. Clearly, the Culberson, especially as we do more drilling on the western side, we're seeing very, very good results. We've talked about some of those wells in the past like the Charismatic, the American Pharoah. We have a number of other ones that are flowing back right now that, again, given sufficient flow back time, we will then elaborate upon. But Culberson itself is starting to step out as an area that \u2013 especially that Western side that we're getting very excited about.","But I would also say up in Lea County, Lea-Eddy County particularly, but Lea, we've already talked about a number of our Avalon wells, earlier in the year the Coriander, Thyme. We have a number of additional Avalon wells that we're drilling. And then the Wolfcamp, we're just now starting to bring on some of our 2-mile Wolfcamps in Red Hills. And just frankly based on some offset operator wells and our expectations, we're very excited about what we'll see coming out of there. And then, again, you flip up into Anadarko. I made mention of the latest well in our 14-10 area, the Gresham well. I understand that that well has quite a bit of gas production. Not as much oil, but one must also take into consideration, that is the westernmost edge of our entire 14-10 block and that we've already kind of now bracketed that interval that, as we move to the East, we're going to see higher and higher yields and that just leads to better and better returns.","And the significance of that well just shows that we're still seeing great productivity across all of that acreage. So, we're pretty excited about that area from a future development standpoint. So, that's just a few of the areas that I will highlight. There's many more, but those are a few.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. I just want to add to that. As all of you know, we don't manage Cimarex around quarterly numbers. We manage Cimarex around long-term investment and long-term quality returns fully burdened. And so, as we look ahead, although John can't talk about them because we don't have enough production, we've been testing a number of landing zones throughout our portfolio and it's got our attention. We have some really interesting results, and we're in a process of relooking at our capital program going forward. We'll adapt and emphasize some things that are working really well.","We've got a few things across our portfolio that we're flowing back that \u2013 I'll just say this \u2013 really have our attention. So, it's given John a little heartaches. I'm in his office every morning saying, all right, how do we rejigger our future capital allocation to take advantage of these learnings? So, we're always adapting, always innovating.","And John mentioned that Gresham well. That 14-10 area is a phenomenal project for us because not only does it have very high rate of return Woodford. But now it looks like we've got a pretty lights-out outstanding Meramec sitting right on top of it. So we're pretty upbeat about the prospects for our investment portfolio going forward.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for the color.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Tom, I wanted to see if you could maybe elaborate on your commentary on 2019 and plans to maybe time some of the tills with when the basis differentials improve. So I was wondering how that could \u2013 how are you thinking about rig activity and your completion cadence as you articulate that view?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, that's a great follow on to my last statement, Arun. As we look at 2019, we are looking at maximizing our returns. Now that hopefully doesn't come as a surprise to any of our listeners. We don't manage our own production growth. I mean, production growth is a great consequence of a well-managed return portfolio. And so we're looking at just allocating capital around returns and to the extent that that has an ongoing bias for some of our Delaware projects, the timing of these things is something we're going to look at to try to bring that production on in the second half of the year.","I mean, I know that maybe that's not what people want to hear, but it's the truth, that when we look at these basis differentials that are pretty severe on the oil side in the Permian Basin, the pipelines begin to come online in the second quarter, more and more of them come online in the third quarter, and you can look at the futures curve on that Mid-Cush differential and the market sees what we see, it will collapse. And so we'd like to time flush production in our Permian program. We take advantage of that flush cash flow with new wells. I mean, it's not \u2013 there's not really any major announcement here on redoing our capital program, it's just we always have to manage timing as well as capital allocation and the Permian has a rather unique opportunity around timing.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And so, perhaps the till schedule could kind of look like 2018 where it's more back-end loaded.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, we haven't really \u2013 I mean, I don't know the answer to that as we sit here right now because we have two basins to allocate around. So, I'm just \u2013 my comments are specific to Permian.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great, Tom. And my follow up is just what your thoughts, Tom, on utilizing the proceeds from the Ward County sale. I think that transaction closes later this month, early in September, but just thoughts on utilizing the proceeds from that divestiture?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, as I said in my opening remarks, our board has really put a lot of energy into that. And we looked at all of our options and look at what does it mean to a healthier, more profitable Cimarex which benefits our long-term owners. And exploring all of our options, the place where we've currently landed is reinvesting that cash over the next several years into our core business.","And we're pretty confident that with the returns we're generating and the repeatability we're seeing that that's the best answer for the Cimarex shareholder. Now, I'm going to finish where I started and that's that this is constantly debated by our board. They're actively engaged in this topic. And as I've sat around the table with our board and listened to the debate around this, I'm pretty pleased with the open mindedness of our board and the focus on shareholder value. We'll grow our dividend over time. We're pleased and dedicated to a growing dividend. But right now, we're sufficiently confident in our core business performance that that's where we think the proceeds are best invested over the next few years.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Mike Scialla of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Tom, you mentioned in your opening remarks about potential bolt-ons. Just want to see, in general terms, how you see the landscape? We saw a lot of private companies bought out in 2017. How do you see the landscape now versus then? And how does the deal flow compare between your two core basins?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, the landscape is active. I think although there have been some large transactions announced, I don't know that we've seen the kind of chatter that we've seen in the marketplace the last few years, but we see some opportunities. I mean, we're \u2013 John can comment on it, but we're digging into some things. And in both of our basins and beyond, we've got a lot of energy applied to this. It's really a natural extension of our confidence in the returns we're generating and the repeatability. There are some things that are at or near some of our projects that we're looking at. Now, these things are always a long shot. But, boy, you have to be in the game in order to win. John, you want to talk about that?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. I think especially in light of \u2013 and Tom mentioned this earlier, we're constantly not just looking to develop our established zones but look for other upside within our current positions. And when we do that, we take that risk. We see that that leads to additional drilling opportunities, then we immediately ask ourselves, well, is that prevalent, or is that existing on adjoining positions that maybe we could go in and then make a competitive offer to try to bring that acreage in. It's not easy. I mean, still to this day, obviously, valuations are still very high. But if we think we have a potential opportunity to maybe enhance someone's acreage position more so than what another operator has done, then, yeah, hopefully, we can make a competitive bid and bring some of those in. But it's something we're always looking at. And that's just part of our business. We have to constantly look for those bolt-on positions.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","One of the things I mentioned in prior call is that our initial motivation when we put Ward on the market was because we were looking at an opportunity and we were quite interested in it. And we were not successful in acquiring that opportunity. But one thing I will say on behalf of the executive team, we are deeply committed to, is that although we've decided to sell Ward and we're quite pleased with the price that we're getting for it, those assets will be \u2013 that cash will be deployed in a manner that is much more productive to us in our portfolio than those assets currently are, and we're committed to that.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. Very good. I wanted to ask, too, about the Hallertau \u2013 I hope I can pronounce it. I don't think I can \u2013 but that spacing unit. It looks to me like \u2013 if I'm doing the math right \u2013 that you're really \u2013 you said you're testing 12 wells per section. But if all three of those zones would have worked, wouldn't that imply more than 12 wells per section? And I guess, what was the concept behind just 50-feet of vertical spacing there? Would you \u2013 were you're looking to see if you could fit three layers within the Wolfcamp A or, I guess, just trying to understand that better?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, yes. Yes, we were. I mean, this was an instance where going in, as I said, we were pretty confident that we had sufficient thickness and resource in place that we could easily develop that section and all of our other high prospective section around there at 12 wells a section. And yet we also had some information that I would say maybe there's enough resource in place to where you could bring those wells closer vertically. And if you had a very successful outcome, then indeed that would add an additional bench of drilling.","What we have observed is that from those wells landing in the upper part, which is the 50-foot distance spacing, that we are seeing greater acceleration between the wells and what our pre-drill forecast would've expected. And so what's happening? Simply, we probably have our resource in place wrong. This isn't something that's easy to do. We worked very hard at it. We take whatever data we have to come up with that calculation from that. We then go forward and we test.","I will point out that we kind of knew that going in here. I will also point out that's why we tested this particular section. These are only 5,000-foot laterals. It's not 2-miles. Thus, we thought from a capital investment standpoint, this was a worthy test to do. If indeed these wells perform better, then that would have really meant quite a bit of upside for us on the rest of our acreage where we do have 2-mile opportunities.","So, we will do these types of test from time to time. And we learn a lot from the Hallertau we have. We, again with great confidence from those wells, feel very good about going forward with 12 wells per section throughout the area there in that Lea, Eddy County line area. And that's how we'll plan to go forward from now on, at least for the time being.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","One of the motivations here, in hindsight, it may look differently than it did to us in planning this, but I will tell you that when we configured this project, we had recently observed from some Anadarko Basin work that suddenly stacked\/staggering had a tremendous impact on productivity. And that we didn't need to put much vertical separation in order to get take advantage of that stacked\/staggering. So, Hallertau was our attempt to try it in the Wolfcamp.","Now, we knew it was risky. We knew that it's not just a layup transfer from an Anadarko Basin where you have a very different stress profile carrying it to the Delaware Basin. But based on our experience in Anadarko, we said, you know what, this is an experiment worth taking. And we learned a tremendous amount. And we learned that, you know what, it doesn't. That they were too close vertically. But if you don't try things you don't make progress.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. But are you comfortable with the 12 wells per section which is (00:40:30)...","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Absolutely. I mean, absolutely at 12 given similar thickness as the Hallertau section. Yes, we're very confident.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, guys. My question I think is for John. John, when I'm looking on a couple of areas here either around the Tim Tam, here in Culberson or a couple of your plays in Reeves. I mean I'll just pick a couple, like Snowshoe or Dixieland. Your thought \u2013 on Pagoda State, you've got that now all the way up to 16 wells per section. And then I think if I recall that somewhere in Animal Kingdom you're closer to 14. Is there even more upside there? I guess my sort of long-winded question is, is there more upside in those areas to even downspace more? How do you think about sort of the \u2013 is it more like a cube development or more just on the spacing?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I always hope there's upside. We always are asking ourselves how can we most effectively drain the total hydrocarbon system there. But specifically to your question as a follow up to Pagoda, that is why we've done the Snowshoe. The Snowshoe is at 18-wells a section. We took the Pagoda learnings and from that we actually went and added a third layer so we have three benches, and then we widened the spacing between individual wells. That was a direct outcome from Pagoda learnings. And I believe we do have a wine rack showing that particular development project. So, we are from Pagoda going to test even tighter with the Snowshoe.","Likewise, when you go over to Culberson in the Lower Wolfcamp from the Tim Tam and the excellent results we had there, we became convinced that there was more resource there than just those wells with access. And that led us then to the Animal Kingdom design whereas again you pointed out we're tighter, we added an extra bench. And those are the two very significant pilots that, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, one of them is already flowing back, and the Animal Kingdom here will be coming on here by next month.","We will be watching those projects very, very carefully. And like all of these development projects, we won't really high-five just after 30 days of production. We'll need 90 days. We have a lot of, I would just say, science in place to measure these wells, to assess how they are performing, and we'll feel pretty good I think after 90 days as to whether or not that type of tighter spacing is going to be kind of the next norm for us and, more importantly, if we could go even tighter, again based on what we see coming out of those wells.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Does that change as you go more into that lower \u2013 you're talking about over in the Animal Kingdom, some of those lower zones. Does that play into sort of how much the gassy nature or oily nature depending on how you start to target in those areas of the overall company, or is it (00:43:35)?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, the hydrocarbon type definitely factors into our decision-making on spacing. I would say first and foremost, just overall thickness of the hydrocarbon interval itself has the biggest effect in terms of how much is in place and how many wells do we think we required to drain it. But we definitely take into account whether were gas in the reservoir, oil in the reservoir, the initial pressure that we expect from those wells, all of that factors into ultimately how many wells per section we think we can put in there to both.","And again, it's something we talk a lot about. It's that tradeoff of maximizing the overall return on that project while also achieving the highest PV possible. And again, we think in the Snowshoe and Animal Kingdom, we think those are designed, we feel, very fit for purpose for both those sections. Now, the proof again will be in the performance of the wells as they come on.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And last, if I could, Tom, just one for you. When you think about flow assurance, it's a pretty broad definition. Do you assume some people just think it's firm sales, others say it has to be firm transportation? If you think about having certainly what you call a sort of guarantee flow assurance, how do you think about that overall? Thank you.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I don't know that I can give you a global answer, but you're asking Cimarex, I'll give you a Cimarex answer. Our flow assurance is we have contracts for sales with people that have flow and have themselves firm transport. It's also long-term marketing arrangements, and we're in a relationship business. So, we have a high degree of confidence that when we tell you that our product will flow, it will flow to market. As Joe has told you, these sales agreements are at index price, and although we do have hedges in place that mitigate a little bit of that sting, we are exposed to these differentials.","We've talked about this in the past. We have chosen at this time, we re-evaluate this constantly, but at this time, we have chosen not to enter into these long-term firm sales contracts. We know these differentials will collapse and we think that we will be grateful at that point that we didn't enter into these long-term commitments. But even so, that's not a theology. We debate this constantly. But we are very confident that we have marketing arrangements and our product will flow to market.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great details. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, John.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Nelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. There's been a real investor pivot to E&P spending within cash flow the last few years. Given your rate of return focus, what most \u2013 and you even just commented, expect to be a transitory weakness in Permian oil differentials and the substantial amount of cash you're going to have on your balance sheet post the Ward County sale, how are you thinking about balancing cash flow in 2019?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, we haven't obviously set out 2019 plans, but I think that the way we're thinking about it is that, as we look into 2019, we have a strong bias to be at or near cash flow. I don't think you'd see a huge outspend from us in 2019. Mark, do you want to touch on that one?","G. Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah, John. I think even this year so far than the (00:47:07) first half of the year, you're obviously been around cash flow, second half of the year with the increasing completions in the second half of the year in capital, and also widening differentials will be outspending in second half of the year. But going into 2019, we haven't set our plan on drilling and capital expectations. But I think on a development plan program, like the (00:47:25) cash flow but then there's inorganic opportunities that might cause us to have some additional expenditures.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I guess, just a push on that. If your margins are going to be squeezed for kind of this transitory phenomenon, it would feel like your rate of return focus should kind of push you to look through that as opposed to ramping down, call it, kind of normalized activity in 2019. Is it just the confidence on pipelines coming on or wanting to be closer to spending within cash flow that's kind of important to you or I'm not sure we kind of see where I'm going with the question. But it seems like you should be \u2013 given your rate of return focus, Cimarex I would think would be more willing to kind of look through 2019 weakness.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, we do look through 2019 weakness. And we see this as a near-term phenomenon and, John, again, we haven't formalized nor announced our 2019 plans. But there's a fair amount of whiplash I'm getting here and that we hear a lot of competing voices out there. And we just focus on investing in our business and focusing on the returns.","One thing I will tell you is that when we look at this widening differential, and I said in my opening remarks, we bake those differentials into all of our returns, so that we're not surprised by them and they're treated upfront and accounted for in my investment decisions. But I'll just finish, John, by saying, I don't think we'd be in a massive outspend in 2019. I think our bias is to be a little more tempered. But we haven't really made those decisions yet.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","No, that's helpful. And my second question I guess just on the 2018 capital spending guide. I just wanted to check that we still kind of feel good about that guidance range for the year. You noted that 70% of the completions are still going to happen in the back half. We've used 40% to 45% of the full-year budget in the front half. I know it's never kind of that simple with regards to spending outlays. But do we still feel kind of comfortable with the range for the year or could there be kind of more towards the top end or an upward bias?","G. Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.","John, at this point, the way we're modeling it, to tell you we do see that that range, we're very comfortable with that range in midpoint or even below the midpoint of that range. So, that's the way we see it at this point, John, so.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. I'll let someone else hop on. Thanks.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And today's next question comes from Paul Grigel of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Good morning. One quick maybe more theoretical question. As you guys kind of take the Ward sale proceeds, that was obviously at a fairly low cost basis historically and you roll that forward. You've previously commented about your operating groups needing to kind of bear the burden of any acquisition on a cost. If you roll those proceeds into another acquisition, does the operating group got to keep that lower cost basis is kind of an acreage swap, if you will, or is it reset at the higher cost of entry?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, the way we account for our dollars and the way our compensation systems for operating groups are configured, they would bear the incremental cost of the higher entry point. I mean, that's just the way we view the world. Now, Ward is a case in point as we've said. Although Ward are good assets, I really am highly confident that they're going to prove out, over time, to be very good assets as they have been for us. But they weren't competing for capital in our portfolio. And therefore, in a valuation standpoint when you look at our internal value for the discounted value of that future drilling opportunity award because we were under-investing in it that discounted value is suffering.","And so, if we were to take those proceeds and roll them into a different asset, it would be because we were going to be investing aggressively in that asset. And I think you'd find that on a discounted value-to-discounted value comparison, the new assets would be much more valuable at Cimarex. And the way we count our money, we would fully burden it with the purchase price of a new asset. Now, I \u2013 please don't take this telegraph \u2013 me telegraphing it, oh, my goodness. There's something Cimarex is imminently going to buy with that money. But I'm just answering your question as asked.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","No. I appreciate that and understood. I guess as a follow-up in a similar vein, one of the elements you guys added to your proxy statement this year was examining shareholder returns via dividends, buybacks, various different metrics as a plan that was being internally looked at. Is there any update that you guys can provide just on where you're at? Again, maybe even a little more theoretically, but also with a good cash position there.","G. Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah, Paul. This is Mark. We are continuing with that. As Tom mentioned in his opening remarks that we have an active discussion with our board regularly on that kind of a subject on the shareholder returns, dividend pace, and we'll continue to have those kind of discussions. And certainly, as we raise our dividend this year is an example of how we are trying to return more to shareholders, the board is definitely supportive of having a pattern of growing dividend over time as our cash flows and production grow. And again, as we look at our cash balances and looking at options to invest that cash balance organically in our business or other opportunities and return to shareholders, all continue to be debated that, as Tom said at this point in time, our asset investment is our principal focus at this point in time. We see that as being a superior for our long-term shareholders.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Of those three things you mentioned, dividends, buybacks, investing in our business, I'd like to put dividends aside because dividends are a separate case for us. We like paying a dividend. It enforces a discipline on us as a management team. It's a constant reminder that we work for our owners and returning that cash to our owners on a sustainable and growing manner is something that is healthy, and it affects our behavior every single day.","Now, the other two in comparing, we're going to look at the metrics based on the long-term value as an incremental place to put cash. And obviously, proof is in the pudding. What I said in my opening remarks is our board under careful consideration has landed on our businesses as the best option from the analysis.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","No, that's good color. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Mark.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Gents, I realize that you haven't put the 2019 plan together as such, as yet. But obviously this year has been quite lumpy by way of completions. And I think as you pointed out, the next month or two is going to be pretty active. I just wonder given that we're coming up in the middle of August I guess, can you give us a confidence level in your execution on getting those 80-plus completions done and maybe some idea how the cadence looks going through 2019 and maybe an exit rate going into 2019 particularly on oil production? And I've got a follow up, please.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. This is Joe. I'll just try and answer that from a net well count standpoint. Operationally, as I think John mentioned earlier, we are set up to have all these completions come into play. For the most part \u2013 most of all the pilots have been drilled. It's just a matter of aligning the completion operations then with five \u2013 just pick the Permian with five crews to get the wells completed. That said, you could always run into an operational difficulty along the way.","But all of that said, if I look at a profile without giving specifics of net wells per month that would be completed, the bulk of our completions are forecasted to transpire between August and October. And then for this year's program kind of taper off as you go into December.","So, if you were to say, okay, does that give you any leeway, are we projecting a huge completion ramp into December, I'm going to tell you, no, it's happening in late Q3 and early Q4 and then, really, this is no different than we've been talking about all year. And to-date, our cadence has been relatively tight with what we've projected.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, as you look into \u2013 just to clarify, as you go into 2019, do we get the flat spots again or is the cadence more ratable as we go into that next year's program?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, again, we haven't put our 2019 plan together. So, it's going to be hard to answer that specifically. But the fact of the matter is, if you have a program that consists of single wells and multi-wells, you will always have some degree of increases and decreases rather rapidly as compared to a single well associated with multi-wells coming online.","And that's we're looking at this stuff by month or by quarter, in some respects, from our opinion, we look at this as more long-term than near-term. And it's all focused on rate of return and, heck, all it takes is a 10-well program that we forecast to come on on October 15. And if it came on on November 1, it's going to have a big impact on the third quarter and have a heavy impact on the fourth quarter. But the (00:57:17) are still there. They're just getting moved.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess my \u2013 it's really more. So, I don't want to belabor the point, but I guess there's a lot of focus obviously on the oil mix as you go forward. So, you're really just going to trying to get some kind of a handle as to how you see the exit rate going into 2019 with the cadence that you've laid out. So, that was the last kind of part of my question. I don't know if you care to opine on that.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. The second quarter had \u2013 we saw higher than expected NGL recoveries. Walking into the quarter, we put together our guidance knowing that there was a likelihood of higher recoveries in the Permian but just had initial information which to base our forecasts. And as such, we put together an increased but conservative forecast for NGLs.","And as the quarter then later transpired primarily because of some nice price strengthening in the Permian, we saw higher than anticipated recoveries coming out of our Permian program. The way we've modeled our current forecast, we're assuming those recoveries continued through the end of the year.","And so, to the extent, what you're seeing in Q2 as far as NGL mix and oil mix and gas mix is concerned, assuming that prices stay where they are and assuming that recovery does transpire because we don't always get to pick, either our processor does or we do. And if we do, it's always an economic decision. Those could vary a bit. But as far as the ingredient built into our guidance, it's continuation of the Permian recoveries through the end of the year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great so far. I realize we're at the top of the hour, so I'll jump off. Thanks, guys.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, as we've reached the top of the hour, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. I want to thank everybody for joining us today.

Please go ahead.","Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.","Good morning, and welcome to the Cimarex first quarter 2018 conference call. An updated presentation was posted to our website yesterday afternoon, and we will be referring to this presentation during the call today.","As a reminder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business.

And then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on operations, including production and well costs. Our CFO, Mark Burford is here to help answer any questions you might have.","So that we can accommodate more of your questions during the hour we have allotted for the call, we'd ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, feel free to get back in the queue if you like.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you, Karen, and welcome to everyone on the call this morning. Cimarex delivered a strong first quarter. We reported solid operational and financial results, with production averaging 206,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was at the high-end of our guidance. Oil production for the quarter averaged over 65,000 barrels per day, we reported adjusted net income of $174 million or $1.82 per share. We're off to a strong start to 2018.","In the Delaware Basin, we have 14 new Cimarex-operated wells, which achieved a sustained 30-day peak production rate during the first quarter. These 14 wells had an average IP-30 of 1,908 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Oil from these wells averaged 1,178 barrels of oil per day. Our production and capital guidance for the year remain unchanged, with production anticipated to average 216,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the midpoint and capital projected to be $1.65 billion at the midpoint.","We have a number of projects underway that we look forward to discussing as results come in. Our Lea County, New Mexico program is delivering strong results as we expected. In Lea County, Reeves County, and Culberson County, we have a number of development programs underway that are progressing well, and we look forward to discussing their results as the year rolls on. John will update you on a few of these projects in a moment.","Thus far, service costs inflation has not been a significant factor in 2018. Furthermore, we are increasing our use of local sand in the Delaware Basin, which holds the promise of modestly decreasing our stimulation costs. The overwhelming majority of our wells for 2018, are multi-pad development wells, whose capital efficiencies are included within our guidance range.","We also announced marketing commitments that give us surety of flow for our Permian gas volumes through 2019. Although we expect midstream operators to find additional takeaway capacity through compression upgrades and creative engineering of flow dynamics, these marketing commitments give us confidence that our gas will flow to market. While the conversation revolves around gas, these marketing commitments for our gas volumes are really insurance that protects our oil revenues, which are projected to be almost 75% of our total Permian revenues.","In the current environment, oil revenues are the backbone of both our cash flow and our development project economics. We are in good shape on oil takeaway. We have strategic partners in our core areas who purchase our oil and have backstopped these volumes with firm pipeline takeaway. Over 70% of our Permian oil volumes leave the field on pipe, which reduces our exposure to trucking volatility. These marketing commitments are priced at local index. Although 30% to 35% of our Permian oil basis differential is hedged, the majority of our sales are at index price.","Temporary blips in index pricing are a part of the business that we are prepared to weather. These differentials are baked into our cash flow models and development economics. As I tell our organization, we are an ark, not a party boat. We retain flexibility to adjust our CapEx as conditions dictate. At this time, we're holding firm with our previously-announced production and CapEx guidance. However, as conditions change, we're prepared to make adjustments to adapt to these changes. Right now, it's steady as she goes.","We said at the beginning of the year that 2018 would be a year that defines companies by their ability to execute complex projects, apply good science, and deliver results that are top-tier. Cimarex continues to be driven by science, as we work on configuring development projects that maximize value, understand the physics of our stimulations and well-to-well interference, and execute a capital program that delivers full cycle, fully-burdened returns. We have not strayed from that focus. Production growth and headline wells are fun and interesting, but there are consequences of good investment decisions, not primary drivers. We are here for the long run.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thanks, Tom. During the first quarter, Cimarex invested $313 million in exploration and development activities, of which $264 million was invested in the drilling and completion of new wells. 61% of our capital was spent in the Permian region and 38% in the Mid-Continent. We brought 15 net wells on production during the quarter and are currently operating 13 gross rigs, with 10 in the Permian region and three in Mid-Continent.","Now, I'll turn to some specifics about each region. I will start in the Permian region where we brought nine wells online during the first quarter, including two significant Avalon wells in Lea County, New Mexico. One of them, the 10,000-foot lateral Coriander AOC 1-12 State 1H, had an average peak 30-day initial potential rate of 3,333 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 67% was oil, 17% NGL, and 16% gas. While the other, the 5,000-foot lateral Thyme APY FED 19H, had an average peak 30-day rate of 2,059 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 69% oil, 18% NGL, and 13% gas.","The results and learnings from these two Avalon wells are proving critical in finalizing the final stimulation design for the soon-to-be completed six well Triste Draw spacing pilot, which is testing 20 wells per section within two benches in the Avalon section.","Moving on to the Wolfcamp, where we have two spacing tests currently waiting on started completion. In Culberson County, the Animal Kingdom infill development, which consists of eight 10,000-foot laterals in the Lower Wolfcamp should begin fracking operations in early June. These wells are testing the equivalent of 14 wells per section by both decreasing the spacing between wells in a bench plus adding an additional landing zone in the top part of the Lower Wolfcamp, a zone which we used to refer to as the Wolfcamp C. These wells are expected to be on production by the end of the third quarter.","Another important test in the Upper Wolfcamp, located in Reeves County, is the Snowshoe pilot, which is scheduled to begin completions later this month. These eight 10,000-foot wells are testing the equivalent of 18 wells per section in the Upper Wolfcamp. Stay tuned for result on these development projects later this year.","As shown on slide 12 of our investor presentation, we continue to make great strides in understanding and designing highly-economic development projects, with the appropriate completion design, landing zone, as well as the optimal number of development wells per section. As shown on the bar chart, our latest generation completion design, Gen 4, was used not only on single-well projects, but also to complete our first ten 10,000-foot Upper Wolfcamp infill wells, which are located in Reeves County.","Not only did these wells achieve 90% of the 180-day cumulative production number of the 23 parent wells completed with that same design, they have also significantly outperformed their actual parent well which was completed with a Gen 2 completion. You can view this performance on slide 16. And because of the efficiencies gained from pad drilling and zipper fracs, the Gen 4 infill wells were drilled and completed at a cost, which is approximately 90% that of a Gen 4 parent well.","Now on to the Mid-Continent. Completion operations are underway on the Meramec Steve O development project, which consists of six 10,000-foot laterals landed in two benches within the Meramec. This development is the equivalent of eight wells per section. We've learned a lot from our own spacing pilot, the Leon Gundy, as well as the results of several recently completed non-operated Meramec spacing pilots. These learnings were incorporated into to the final landing zones and completion design for this and other Meramec development projects planned for 2018.","First production from the Steve O well is expected in August. We planned to spud three other Meramec development projects in 2018 across our acreage position. And in the Woodford Lone Rock area, completion operations are underway on the Shelly spacing pilot, with first production expect to begin in late September. Furthermore, a second Lone Rock development project called JD Hoppinscotch will finish drilling by the end of this month, with completion operations scheduled to begin in early June.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'll touch on our first quarter production, our full-year 2018 production guidance, and then, I'll finish up with a few comments on Permian takeaway, LOE and service costs. As Tom mentioned, we had a solid quarter for our production in Q1, with reported equivalent volume of 206.1 MBOEs per day. We came in above the upper-end of our guidance and set new records for equivalent production at both the company and regional levels.","With the mark, we were up 3% over Q4 2017 and 16% over Q1 2017. Oil, again, drove the growth with our Q1 net oil production of 65,212 barrels a day, up 6% over Q4 2017 and 25% over Q1 2017. With strong activity in both areas, we continue to see nice production gains in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent. Our first quarter Permian posting of 114.2 MBOEs per day was up 19% as compared to Q1 2017, while our Mid-Continent volume of 91.4 MBOEs per day was up 13% from a year ago. Oil, again, played a significant role in regional production growth, with our Q1 Permian oil volume up 21% and our Mid-Continent volume up 38% as compared to Q1 2017.","Moving on to our 2018 production outlook, with a strong Q1 in the books, and some slight shifting of completion timing into the second half of the year, we're maintaining our full-year guidance projection of 211 MBOEs per day to 221 MBOEs per day. Similar to our discussion last call, the majority of our completion activity is planned for later in the year, with an estimated 38 net completions timed for the first half of the year, and 83 timed for the second half of the year. With that we're projecting second quarter production to be relatively flat to Q1, followed by a strong production ramp beginning in late Q3 and extending into Q4. With the ramp, we're projecting our Q4 oil volumes to be up 30% to 35% over our Q4, 2017 oil volume of 61,771 barrels per day.","With the model we're guiding our Q2, net equivalent volumes to land in a range of 200 MBOEs per day to 209 MBOEs per day, with our forecasted late year production ramp resulting in a full-year guidance range of 211 MBOEs per day to 221 MBOEs per day, that's an 11% to 16% increase over 2017 production.","Few words on Permian takeaway. With the recent tightening of product takeaway in the Permian, our marketing team has been hard at work to ensure, our oil, gas, and NGLs move out of the basin. On the gas side, we've agreed to terms for the sale of more than 98% of our projected Permian residue gas volumes through October of 2019.","Our NGL production is linked to numerous processing facilities across the basin where we have either purchaser-backed, firm or established long-term sale arrangements in place. And on the oil side, the majority of our Permian oil is on pipe, the strategic partnerships and oil agreements in place to ensure flow through 2019 and beyond.","Our marketing team has done a great job to ensure, flow is coming out of the Permian and they remain equally focused on flow out of the Mid-Continent as well, where we are currently evaluating all means to ensure, near to long-term product flow to get our oil, gas, and NGL to market.","Our goal in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent is to ensure product flow. On a realized price basis, however, we will still be exposed to the El Paso, and Waha basis differentials in the Permian, and the Panhandle and Ann Arr (15:37) and OGT differentials in the Mid-Continent. Shifting gears to OpEx, our Q1, lifting costs came in at $3.84 per BOE, down slightly from the $3.89 posting we had in Q4 2017, and in the lower-end of our guidance range of $3.75 to $4.35 per BOE. We saw some cost pressure in items such as compression, contract labor, and rentals during the quarter, and with Q1 in the books and our previous guidance incorporating potential cost creep during the year, we're keeping our lifting costs guidance midpoint intact, but we're tightening our range to $3.80 to $4.30 per BOE for the remainder of the year.","And lastly, some comments on drilling and completion costs. On the drilling side, we've seen some small increases in ancillary services such as mud and cement and equal pressure on rig day rates during the quarter. But with our continued focus on efficiencies and primarily a result of our completion costs components remaining relatively in check, as Tom mentioned during the quarter, our current drilling and completion AFEs remain in check, with the ranges that we quoted last call, with the exception of our Permian wells, which should begin to see the cost savings benefits of us procuring a regional sand sourcing arrangement with our service provider beginning here in May.","In the Permian, depending on area, interval, facility design and frac logistics, our current Wolfcamp 2-mile AFEs are running in the range of $11 million to $13.5 million. With local sand sourcing, we anticipate this range dropping to approximately $500,000 per well to $10.5 million to $13 million here in Q2. With our New Mexico Bone Spring development in the deeper areas of northern Eddy and Lea Counties, our 1-mile Bone Spring AFEs are running $7 million to $8.5 million per well, and again, with local sand sourcing, we're anticipating to drop this range by $300,000 per well to $6.7 million to $8.2 million.","In Cana, our 1-mile lateral Woodford AFEs continue to run around $7.5 million to $8 million. And with our current frac design, our 2-mile Meramec AFEs are still on the $11.8 million to $12.8 million range, the same levels we quoted last call.","So, in closing, we had a solid first quarter. Our liquids-rich focus in the Permian and Mid-Continent continues to generate sizable oil growth. Our beginning year 2018 production guidance remains unchanged. Projecting a strong Q4 production ramp, with Q4 oil volumes forecasted to be up 30% to 35% from Q4 2017. Our lifting and development costs remain in check, with further Permian well costs reductions anticipated in Q2, with the implementation of local sand sourcing. And we've taken steps on the marketing inside to ensure takeaway issues do not become a bottleneck for either 2018 or 2019 Permian programs. We remain excited about the prospects for yet another successful year here in 2018.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Mike Scialla with Stifel.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask you about your guidance, in particular, for second quarter production, you're forecasting kind of flattish, with first quarter actually down slightly, looking at what you did in the first quarter when you brought on only 15 net wells, you had some sequential growth. Looks like you're planning on adding more wells in the second quarter than you did in the first quarter, I think 23 wells. Just wondering is that too simplistic in approach to suggest that your second quarter guidance is conservative, or I guess, any color you can add to that?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is Joe, and I guess I'll answer that question is relative to what we guided at the beginning of the year. We virtually from our standpoint have not seen significant change in our guidance at all. Last quarter, we were quoting, I think, 45 wells during the first half of the year and 82 wells in the latter half of the year. We're currently at 38 wells in the first half of the year and 83 wells in the last half of the year.","The shifting of completions that I mentioned about is really associated with, primarily with one of our eight well infill projects, which was scheduled to come on here in Q2, but we'd split it into Q3. And that was due primarily to a drilling issue on one of the wells, and when you have an eight well project, one well can affect all eight with regard to the timing of the completion of all eight wells.","And it's not just that type of program that's really driving our production profile. We've got the Animal Kingdom eight well projects; the Hallertau, six well projects; Snowshoe, eight well project; Triste Draw, six well project. All of these wells are coming on line here, with the majority of our capital going into Q2 and Q3 and in fact, we're up in our rig count \u2013 our frac fleet count up to 6 fleets here in June. The profile you're seeing is just a result of that.","And what Tom alluded to, we don't run our business based on what production profile we're going to get, we run it on the rate of return and we're expecting to generate out of our projects and the capital that we deploy. So, our profile becomes a byproduct of it, and if you look at net well counts changing, I know Karen's got a number of questions about what wells dropped or what wells didn't, I'll simplify it and say as compared to our previous model, we had 12 wells move out of Q2 and Q3 that were previously in our original year guidance. Two of those wells moved into the first quarter. Seven of those wells moved into either fourth quarter or first quarter of 2019 and three other ones moved further in the year with a reshuffling of some of our drilling schedule. The bottom line to us is, the guidance didn't change.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Mike, let me just add to that. Our guidance, we tried to do a good job, best we can and sometimes, it's simple and sometimes, it's complex. But our guidance is really a function of two things. Certainly, our well schedule and that's pretty sad. I don't anticipate that's going to change. And then the second factor is our estimate of production per well. And so, is our guidance conservative? Well, I hope not I think it's realistic. We, certainly, try to make it realistic. But we're always playing around with stimulations and to the extent that there's some upside there. I'd love to see us report in the future quarter that our wells produce in excess of what we model based on some stimulation advancement. But I don't think we're sandbagging, that we're just trying to give you our best guess.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, perfect. Thanks. And I want to ask on your gas sales agreement. Are there any minimum volume commitments associated with that, or acres dedication? Anything you can say about how that works?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. I know there'll be number of questions on it. So I'll just cover it at a high level. Fortunately, with our Triple Crown and our Matterhorn systems in place, we have access to multiple markets, which certainly works in our favor. As Tom mentioned, our focus has been surety of flow, make sure the product gets sold. We sell our residue gas either as gas we take-in-kind on the tailgate of a processing plant or directly to the purchaser at the tailgate of the processing plant.","What we've done during the last quarter, and I feel like we've done a very, very good job of is for that gas that we can take-in-kind we're either selling directly to utilities, LDCs, end-users, who have demand, and firm transports or that gas; or to counter-parties and I've put there are reputable processors in the same category that either have firm transport out or a purchaser-backed with purchasers who have firm in their hip pocket to get the gas out of the basin.","So, our goal was to sell to parties that have firm and we have confidence have firm to get the gas out of the basin. We took a look at our projected production profiles, not only of our base wells, but our 2018 and 2019 drilling programs. We looked at what potential residue could be there under recovery or rejection, of each one of those processing facilities and we put our forecasted volumes in place that our marketing team was able to line up with purchasers.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","So, Mike, there's \u2013 we've committed volumes. So, as Joe just said, we do through 2019 estimate volumes. We pre-commit to sell those volumes. And we're going to be working to deliver those volumes. But they're not long-term commitments. They will be on 2019.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","And I might mention that this is a typical day of business for our marketing team. We just don't typically go out two years for our take-in-kind of sales, but we did in this case.","Operator","The next question comes from Joe Allman with Baird.","Joseph Allman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Hi, everybody.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Hi, Joe.","Joseph Allman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","On Slide 19, could you \u2013 regarding the Delaware oil takeaway. Could you talk about the other 30% that does not flow on pipe? And then also, Joe, you mentioned kind of recent tightness. Have you folks actually seen physical signs of tightness?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Joe, this is Joe. We have not seen the signs you're talking about. And I want to take a step back on the oil, because there's a perception out there that the piped oil is safe and the trucked oil may be at some risk. As we've mentioned, the majority of our oil is on pipe and that oil is on pipe with entities that we have these strategic partnerships and agreements in place, with committed volumes that they're allowing us to flow out of the basin. The parties that we're selling to the majority of our oil have pipe out of the basin and we have space on that pipe.","The trucked volumes that we have, albeit although, they may not be on pipe, a vast majority of those trucked volumes are also being sold to those same entities that have the pipe out of the basin where we're able to piggyback on those piped arrangements. If not, in one case, we're selling to purchaser but they're a local refinery. So, what we're seeing from a risk standpoint or a volatility standpoint on the trucking side isn't getting it out of the basin. It maybe, we're at some risk as to what the trucking costs might end up doing.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","You know Joe, what I look at it, when I see these volumes and we look at what percent is on pipe and what percent is on truck, I think about it more in terms of field management and exposure to weather delays and also trucking backlog. I don't think of it, as Joe has described, we don't view it as necessarily a distinction on basin takeaway. But your other question on physical constraints, I'll let Joe address that.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. Joe, we have not been bottlenecked or pinched back on either the NGL, oil, or gas side as a result of the concerns about tightness.","Joseph Allman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up. On slide 12, I know you described it a little bit. But could you describe this more fully, we see the Gen 4 wells and we see the Gen 4 infill wells. My impression is that those Gen 4 infill wells are not the child wells to Gen 4 parent wells. My understanding is that those Gen 4 infill wells are child wells to some of the parent wells you drilled in prior years. I think specifically actually the Gen 2 wells. And yet the last bullet on that slide seems to say that your infill wells are 90% of the parent wells. So, could you just help us figure that out a little bit better?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah, this is John. You are correct in that the infill wells that we're showing on that chart, the parent wells within the same section are not of the same generation, that is a true statement. However, we would actually say it's rather encouraging the productivity of those infill wells, because we would argue that that older generation frac design was quite frankly not very efficient from an infill standpoint, in a way what I mean by that is the older generation we believe was a) probably not as well designed in terms of the cluster spacing just leaving unstimulated rock along the lateral.","So instead it was probably pushing further out from a frac grappling standpoint. So, in some ways, I would argue that, because these infill wells are performing as well as they do, that just attributes to how good our Gen 4 design is. And yeah, we would have every expectation that when we go to develop infill wells next to a Gen 4 parent well, we would still achieve for the same spacing that type of result.","Another way I think about it is, with this later generation design, again, we think that we've eliminated most of the unstimulated rock along the lateral, so we don't see it as much as acceleration as much as we see it as new rock being stimulated, which is why, again, we think it's very important that we're achieving that kind of result so far.","The last thing I'll say is, of those infill wells, I think the other reason we like that number is you have to keep in mind one of those projects was testing very tight spacing, maybe probably beyond what we would normally do in that particular section and yet still we were achieving 90%, and let me be clear, 90% of similar stimulated parent wells, even in the same proximity, which we would say same kind of geology. So no, I think there's a very encouraging chart from what we've seen so far.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah, Joe, your observation's spot on, though. When you look at that slide 12, the parent wells associated with those infill, those infills are better than the parent wells. It's just that those parent wells were older generation. So, all we did in making this slide is we looked at the entire population of Gen 4 wells and we separated out the parent from the infill in that population.","Joseph Allman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","And there's been a lot of questions about that, the optimum infill-to-parent child ratio we're looking for, we could spend the rest of the call on that. That's a subject of intense scrutiny here at Cimarex.","Joseph Allman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","So, if I could just clarify, so that 90%, does that refer to infill wells that are child to parent that are also Gen 4?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. The 90% is basically as you see from the chart, the 90% cum is of the infill 2, all of the parent wells of the similar generation frac. But let me be clear, a lot of these parent wells are in the same proximity as these infill projects. So it is somewhat relative in terms of, you know there's expectation but again, it's also dictated by the ultimate spacing that the infills were drilled at. And right now, given what we have done to date, 90% at least from our observation is a pretty good outcome from a development standpoint, especially when we start factoring in, as I said, some of the cost savings that we realize when we go to infill with the multi-pad drilling zipper fracking, this is a very good economic outcome.","Joseph Allman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. It's all very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, all. Maybe my first question is for John. John, looking at the slide 22 you guys, certainly, have a large amount of that as you pointed out here the stacked opportunities between the Meramec and Woodford. Could you talk about that a little bit more how are you going to continue to tackle that? Will you do some sort of stacked laterals? Or maybe just talk about, number one, where do you see the best prospectivity for that and then how you're going to go after that?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. What you see on slide 22 is a representation of our prospective drilling window for both Woodford in the blue outline and Meramec in the orange. And there is a nice overlap there and indeed we are fortunate to have a large acreage position, in an area that we call 14N-10W where we see very significantly pick Meramec and Woodford. And as we have announced, I think last call, have demonstrated successful results with our Wolfcamp NIV, we're able to stack multi Meramec landings with Woodford Landings.","So, that area particular one is where we'll do some additional testing to get more comfortable what the ultimate spacing will be. But if I back up a minute where we're really at, especially with Meramec is as I said in my prepared remarks, we ourselves are just now moving into development in the Meramec with the Steve O project and with a number of other projects we have scheduled for later this year. We have benefited greatly from all the other spacing pilot projects that have already been brought on, there is a large learning there. And we're feeling pretty confident now that we think we can design the appropriate spacing for the Meramec, based on essentially in-place volumes, hydrocarbon type pore pressure. It will not be one-size-fit-all in the Meramec. We're very much convinced of that.","And as I said, I think even last earnings call, we see variability in the Meramec such that development may range anywhere from four wells maybe up to 10 or 12 wells a section, that's still for us to be decided and that some of the things we'll be testing this year. Coupled with that again is, we will be testing some more stacking of Woodford and Meramec to where we can gain confidence to what that ultimate development looks like for 14N-10W, because it's a pretty daunting challenge. It's a large, large acreage position, large capital commitment on our part, and we want to make sure when we move forward with it that we get it right. I hope that answer your question.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","No, no, that was very good. And then, Tom, might just one follow-up I had, you all have the benefit of having two great players and you know, again, having the optionality to go either with the Mid-Con or the Perm. When you see sort of temporary blips, and as you called it on, dips as you're seeing right now in the Midland Basin, does that cause you to sway and maybe allocate more resources towards the Midland Basin \u2013 or I'm sorry towards the Mid-Con, or do you just not want to get in that game?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I'd love to get into that game, all I need is clairvoyance. The differentials have exploded so fast that \u2013 had one of you on the call tipped me off, we might have redirected capital 12 months, 18 months ago. But this is a longer-term game and these short-term swings they pass and as we've talked about in the past, three markets work efficiently here, we're seeing a lot of projects that are going to collapse these differentials. And although, yeah, I wish we had perfectly predicted them and steered our capital to perfectly mirror the right basin to be bringing incremental volumes into. We just don't have that degree of clairvoyance.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Point taken. Thanks, Tom.","Operator","The next question comes from David Deckelbaum with KeyBanc.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Tom, John. Appreciate the time for the question.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Hi, David.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just curious so far, it sounds like with the agreements in place that you have on the marketing side and the flow assurance, that basis or logistics have not yet changed, how you're thinking about bringing wells online, or timing, or where you're allocating capital to, is that fair?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, it is fair. No, I said in my opening remarks that we're looking at this situation closely. And we're managing our balance sheet, we're managing our cash flow, we're managing our capital expenditures. Right now, we're holding firm. But we've got some flexibility.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, I appreciate that. And I wanted to ask some questions about the in-basin sand savings that you're projecting right now, especially in the Delaware. How are you going to be deploying that, is it going to be ubiquitous across like some of the larger projects, or is it going to be more like in a couple of wells here and there and more of a pilot stage? And are you going to be completing those wells differently than you would with some of the legacy sand?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is Joe. I'll take that one. The intent of the agreement was to and I can't get into the definitive terms in great detail. But to provide us with assurances as to volumes that we felt we would need for the majority of our Permian program, whether it was an Avalon well, Bone Spring completion, Wolfcamp well. And what we ended up doing was come to an agreement on what that volume would \u2013 annual volume commitment would be through our service provider and what our commitment would be on the other side of that.","And with those volumes, I would say a comfortable range to feel that we could utilize 4% local sand versus other would be about at least 80% of each well sand based on our current program right now. Sand needs would be provided through local sand sourcing. And so, that's where I came up with the numbers that I quoted earlier in the call. So, it wouldn't be one type of well or another. It's for the Permian program in general.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Does that agreement allow you to take another source of sand if you deem the results to be inadequate?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. We had always had that flexibility.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Kelly with Seaport Global.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. I wanted to...","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Hey, Mike.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","I wanted to go back to slide 12 and take a look at this kind of infill well performance here. I got two questions on this. One, do you expect the performance delta between the parent-child wells to stay at this kind of 10% level, or could you see further divergence as you get one year to one and a half years out?","And then two, I wanted to get your sense of just how you think about potentially just mitigating the parent-child degradation all together by bringing on these mega pad completions that some are doing, and if that even does mitigate the potential degradation and if you're interested in that? Thank you.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, in regards to our expectation going forward, I would fully expect that if we were to here recently go develop another section with a Gen 4 parent well in that section and develop it with the same spacing that these particular infill wells we drilled at that we would probably achieve about the same ratio from parent to infill. That would be my expectation. And yeah, I do expect that to hold up. Now that's for the same spacing, same thickness, same hydrocarbon in place.","And so, what is fair to say, is we ask ourselves all the time what is the appropriate spacing, and we look at those economics carefully. I'm not sure that one argument can be that infills should be equal to parent. But then you could run into a problem where you are arguing you're leaving some resource behind. So, we do and have always argued there should be some small amount of acceleration between infill wells. But we also recognized that you can go too far, and if you go too far, you can see major degradation in your overall project returns. And so again, this one snapshot here has given a representation from what we've done to date. I would say we're getting close to what we think would be an optimal type of result for an infill to a parent.","I think your other question dealt with the megaprojects, which I think is trying to address just the idea that you don't even have parent, you try to go straight to development and boy in a perfect world, yeah, we have many of us say it'd be great if I can go straight to my acreage and just immediately start developing that and never have to worry about a parent-child relationship.","But then reality sets in for the vast majority of us, we have lease expirations. We have commitments that we have to do in order to perpetuate and to hold that acreage, which requires us in many cases to drill that parent well to then get that acreage to an HBP status.","In those circumstances where we don't have to do that and yeah, we feel like we probably benefit a little bit more by not having that initial parent well there, but let me also say that we internally have spent a lot of time looking at this parent-child relationship, and we recognize that it's very, it's quite variable both across all the different intervals that we develop, as well as one of the biggest factor is time, time that the parent well has been producing relative to when you get back and develop.","And then finally, the type of stimulation you put on that parent well, has a major impact in terms of that ultimate parent child relationship. I think we have moved very aggressively in our understanding such that even if we have some sections with parent wells, I think we feel pretty confident what our ultimate infill wells will do, relative to that parent well. And Tom, I don't know if you want to add anything.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","The only thing I want to add to that is to comment on these megaprojects. I know there's a lot of different philosophies circulating out there on the best development scheme. And we listen to them all. We have a lot of respect for many of the players that are espousing particular philosophies there. We're not of a one-size-fits-all motif, you heard earlier in the call, Joe mentioned that, we've gotten a lot of tons of questions about why's your well count down?","Well, our well count is down because of one side track on one well that backstops the development program and it shifted everything back one month. And so, when you get these megaprojects, you do run the risk of timing delays because of any kind of mechanical interruption that cascades through the whole project. You also have long delays between first investment and first production. And so, as John said we're big fans of megaprojects, because, yes, they do indeed help you manage the parent-child issue, but they also come with their own set of problems. So, we really look at each one in an individual lens and we'll make decisions based on the individual project. So, it's good question and we won't have one answer for our assets.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Yeah, that's fair. I appreciate the discussion. And just follow-up for me on the marketing front. The near-term strategy seems pretty clear, it's focused on flow assurance and you've checked that box. But Tom, I'm curious in the longer-term strategic front here. Has that evolved at all, or any change how you think you'll kind of approach marketing out of the Permian long-term? Thanks.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, we're debating that, we debated all the time. We're going to sound like a broken record here. We really like flexibility and long-term marketing commitments limit your flexibility, if you have long-term volume commitments in a fluctuating commodity price environment, you can find yourself in a situation where your cash flow can fluctuate down and yet you've got these volumes you have to deliver. I mean you don't have to look very far into the landscape of our peers to see stories where people have been caught in that wedge, and we would seek to avoid that. So, we typically want to preserve our flexibility and we'll avoid long-term commitments.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is Joe. I want to follow-up on that too, that to the extent we do make them, we methodically look at projections of production, either oil or gas depending on where we may be locking into, to understand with a start-stop drilling program if needed for capital or price reasons. What volumes we would feel comfortable in committing and we have in the past committed volumes under that type of basis \u2013 or under those terms.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John H. Abbott - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. This is John Abbott on for Doug Leggate, it looks like Doug hopped on to another call. Just a couple of questions for us. First, in the Permian you have sales agreements in place for 98% of your gas through October 9, 2019. You apparently have contracts still in place beyond that. What happens to your outlook, if pipeline such as Gulf Coast Express, which is expected to come online at the end of 2019, were say delayed for some reason for by half of the year?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well. This is Joe. We mentioned October 2019 in our press release and in the call, but we're looking into 2020 as well for these agreements. And I think I mentioned earlier in the call that, this is kind of the day-to-day business for our marketing group to try and get out ahead 6 months to 12 months, with any of our take-in-kind arrangements to sell residue to these utilities.","And so as we creep ourselves closer into 2019, we're not just going to say, no, we can't go past October. We're going to keep perpetuating that. As you know, there are \u2013 every day you turn around there's yet another potential proposed project at Waha, last I saw there were eight or nine of them with over 15 Bcf a day of in cum takeaway out of Waha. And we're looking at all those. We're talking to those players to look out past 2019 as well.","John H. Abbott - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the color. Then our second question is on slide 13 where you talked about the returns for the Culberson long lateral Wolfcamp wells. Compared to 4Q results, it looks like your returns to the upper Wolfcamp have increased and our understanding is that is you're incorporating type curves from your western acreage. As you look out over a three-year to four-year horizon, how reflective are these returns on your go-forward plans?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well I think first off what you're recognizing is indeed a type curve change due to performance on those wells, we've announced in the past on the western side of our Culberson acreage. It's \u2013 quite frankly, we've even been pleasantly surprised just how good and robust those wells have been over there. But there's still a lot to do over there in terms of what does ultimate development look like on the west side of Culberson relative to the east side. We've done a lot of development now on the east and southeast part of our Culberson block with some outstanding results. But as we go to the west, it's a little bit different. It is a little bit gassier, but it has great deliverability, which is leading to the outstanding results we're seeing.","The other thing we're recognizing on the west side is it looks like we may have even additional landing zones to explore and I think I've mentioned that in the past where we're moving further up the section into what has been called the X and Y sands, and we'll soon have some wells that we'll be able to talk about in that. All that will ultimately lead to what our final major investment decision will be on that side and how we'll go about developing that.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","But I would add to that, when we look at any capital allocation and we discussed this on our last call in some detail, when we look at any capital allocation, one of the things we ask ourselves is how repeatable is that program, and how confident are we in that repeatability. And our upper Wolfcamp program we went back and looked at the last two and a half years, three years. And those are years where our program kind of found its rhythm with longer horizontal wells, and we've achieved excellent repeatability.","And when I say that I mean, we measure ourselves on actual to expected, IP-30 rates, actual to expected IP-90 and 180-day rates, actual to expected costs and the actual expected estimated ultimate recoveries. So, there's lots of things we cannot control, commodity pricing being one. But with respect to things we can control, our program particularly in the Wolfcamp is highly repeatable and so we think these returns as evidenced by slide 13 are our go by.","John H. Abbott - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much, very helpful.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Now those \u2013 just let me say before we move off this topic. These are well level returns, that's our incremental data when we make an incremental drilling decision, and I think everybody knows that we, internally when we grade ourselves and look at that repeatability, we're looking at fully burdened returns with all other costs that are associated with prosecuting a program.","Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.","And it's really meant to show just sensitivity to changes in price more than \u2013 it's a blended type curve that represents more than one type curve in the area.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Hi Jeff.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Thinking about the slide 12 discussion in a different way. Slide 16 says that Reeves County, Wood State wells are producing 28% better than parent wells and Pagoda State 16% above parent wells. So how do we compare and contrast the slide 12 analysis that we've had a lot of discussion of with the outperformance in slide 16?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, the answer to that is simple. The parent wells that are being referenced on slide 16 are older generation parent wells. And so, that is not the comparison that we meant to illustrate on slide 12. Had we compared infill wells to their actual parent wells, slide 12 would look much more optimistic. But what we're really trying to illustrate on slide 12 is a completion evolution and not an analysis of infill to parent ratio on any particular project.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Well, and just to follow that up, I think, John, a number of times mentioned the spacing was also important to the discussion of slide 12. Just wondering do these \u2013 does the Wood State or the Pagoda State have perhaps less aggressive spacing than some of the \u2013 he was making some allusions to in slide 12. Is there anything more optimal about spacing there?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is John, I think right now when we look at the Pagoda States and the Wood States, we feel very good about the Wood State results, very, very good about it from a spacing standpoint. We're still looking at the Pagoda States where we tested 16 wells per section and given that particular frac, the Gen 4 frac. We're watching those carefully. I don't know if that is optimal from a rate of return standpoint, but again that's why we do it. That's why we go in and test those type of spacings.","Early time, it looks good, but as we've often said, the proof is over 180-day or even longer and see what the wells ultimately perform at. That's why, again, I'll reference that to show infill results of the same generation frac design that are coming in at that particular percentage, it's rather encouraging. Now again, the proof will be when we go in and infill one of our next sections where we have that similar frac design right next to it and what does that show and that will certainly be some of the things we'll be doing here in the coming years for sure.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And I wasn't sure if I was going to ask this question, but you brought it up with Pagoda. So, I'm not to be nitpicky, but I noticed that the Pagoda State parent well outperformance dropped from 20% in the fourth quarter slides to 16% in the current slides. And it's still a significant outperformance, but I wondered what your take was on it? Does that have maybe to do with the spacing you were talking about?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, yes, I mean, I would again stress that in the case of Pagodas, we were testing limits there in terms of what that ultimate spacing would be. Now, I'm not here to tell you that if we had to do it again 16 will not be the obvious economic decision we would make. But I would say that would be at the very high end for sure based on the performance of the wells so far and again based on our expectations, say of what a Generation 4 parent well would have looked like in that same section. But it's something we're watching very carefully.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","And If I could sneak one, real quick one in I just wanted to ask you those two Avalon, Lea County wells that looked so strong. First of all, is Triste Draw testing Avalon as well, or is that a different zone?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. No, no same.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And how does the spacing of those two Avalon wells that you announced in this quarter compare to the spacing on the Triste Draw?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. No, the two wells that we announced, you would call parent wells, but they were not a spacing test as much as they were drilled on two different sections.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","The significance of those two wells is we were testing different stimulation design as well as a particular landing zone that we chose. You know the devil's in the details, there's a lot \u2013 believe it or not there's quite a bit difference in those frac design between those two wells, from a standpoint of cluster spacing, and what we're trying to determine. The outcome of those two wells as I said in my comments have given us a good confidence in terms of what type of fracture design now we want to deploy on the actual Triste Draw pilot, which we'll be stimulating here very soon.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great. Well I appreciate the color on that. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I think your commentary on program being flexible is interesting. And then you have the cadence of wells by quarter, with differentials and kind of when you bring wells online, is there any long-term value creation for deferring completions through these temporary blips or any major impact of rate of return if you were to choose to push things three months, six months, 12 months? And then the follow-on would be, when you think about the big program, it seems like that could cause a cascade in the whole program as well as opposed to just that the micro level of the individual well, just curious how you think about that decision-making process?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, we \u2013 look, David, I'm going to answer it maybe a simpler answer than your question was asking for, but we're looking at managing our balance sheet, our cash flow and our capital throughout the year and we say, okay, what levers do we have to pull and that's the first thing we ask. Often when we commission these projects, we have the rigs in locations and that drilling lever is pulled a year ago and so that ship has sailed.","But to the extent that we wanted to adjust our capital down, for example, our completion is a lever we have to pull. So we could indeed defer completions a few months or what have you, and have them roll into the next year, that's we've decided at this call that that's not what we're going to do, but an answer, a full disclosure of your question, I believe you're asking, that is a lever we have to pull.","Now what we would do in a case like that is we would look at the futures market and the basis differential, we would look at the economics of deferral, we would look at the differing rate of return between completing a well now and completing a well later and we would also look at our corporate model and how that over printed on our overall corporate growth and out year cash flow, so it's a fairly complex set of inter relationships.","We typically have found and we have typically made the decision that we want to complete a well and get the cash flow as soon as possible coming in the door. That's why Cimarex has never had a big DUC inventory and we've never had a strategic DUC operating philosophy, but that's how we'd look at that. And so when we say we have flexibility, those are our levers. But as of right now, as steady as she goes, our program is our program.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","No. You summarize it the same way I would have. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jamaal Dardar with Tudor, Pickering.","Jamaal Dardar - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Good morning, everyone.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Good morning.","Jamaal Dardar - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","I had a quick question on the Culberson slide once again. You mentioned a few more developments this year. Just wanted to see if we can get some details on what spacing that would pursue, given the consistent performance we've seen on these tighter spacing tests? And then I just wanted to get some clarification on the shallower (59:39) sands. If that was pervasive throughout the position, or is that more isolated on the western half?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah, this is John. I can tell you that we have made a decision on spacing on our next upper Wolfcamp development which \u2013 given the area where we're going, I'm pretty sure that one's going to be an eight wells section. But again, it is \u2013 it's not a one-size-fit-all-across all the acreage. I think if you were to speak in general terms we feel very good at a base level of eight. And then leaning more toward higher counts, where the thickness and hydrocarbon place will allow us to do it. So, I'll just say that the next one certainly is at eight. We have not made a final decision on the one after that. In fact, we have a review coming up on that one here soon to decide what we'll do there.","As far as the opportunity shallower, at least the maps that I've seen the way we're approaching it, I couldn't sit here and say that that it's ubiquitous across all our acreage there. I think it's most obvious to us and parts of the areas where we're testing it which is more on the western side and maybe the southern side. But I will also tell you that as we gain experience in drilling in that interval and understanding, say, an X, Y performance then that in itself changes our maps and then we reassess it and more than likely might open up new areas. It's just the way it always work for us that we go to where we think it's the most logical place and then from learnings, we're constantly surprised that what then opens up based on well results.","Jamaal Dardar - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","All right, thank you. That's helpful. And then just quickly on the gas gathering systems you outlined on your slides, just want to get a sense of the volumes there? And also, at what point do these assets not become strategic to hold onto longer-term?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah, this is Joe. The Triple Crown is our biggest system and we're moving over 300 million a day off that line or off that system and Reeves's a bit behind that. As far as the value of the systems, I think that ties into your question as do you keep them or do you not? Right now, what we see is the true value to those systems or they really do two things. They allow us to have market flexibility, which is certainly panned out here over the last quarter and are securing these takeaway arrangements. And also gives us control of infrastructure where we can start, stop, slow down, move to the left, move to the right with our development over time.","So, we see it as a valuable part of our development. And as far as monetizing them or whatever, that is something that we constantly challenge ourselves with, but we always balance that with the benefits of owning the systems. Tom, I don't know if you want to.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. Listen, this is subject of active debate and I think it's a good question. In a perfect world, if we could get perfect service and multiple marketing outlets, we would probably choose not to own these assets. But right now, we've got a really nimble responsive operation group that's seamless between producing the wells and managing our midstream assets. I think if you look at the Cimarex asset and you could see the level of detail that we see, you'd understand the operational efficiencies that owning these gathering systems gives us. We own and operate our own Gas Lift System, Central Gas Lift. Our wells have high runtime, high compressor runtime, we flare very little volume and we can also adjust our capital on demand.","One of the challenges when dealing with the midstream partner and we talked on this call about commitments is they need some assurance ahead of time to make these capital commitments and they're going to want you to backstop them with long-term volumes. And so, we've made the decision at the present time to hang on to them. But we re-evaluate that more frequently than our operating group would certainly like us to where it's a constant argument and it's a good question, but right now, we think there's a lot of benefit to our profitability with our current structure.","Jamaal Dardar - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","All right. Thank you. I appreciate that.","Operator","The next question comes from John Nelson with Goldman Sachs.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, and congratulations.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Hi, John.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, Tom, and congratulations on the strong operational start to the year. I guess just a follow-on to the firm sales agreements, I kind of curious, were these recently put in place and you're just now disclosing because of a kind of recent investor focus, or have these agreements that you've had \u2013 the marketing departments kind of had as normal course operations for quite some time?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is Joe. If I recall correctly, I think last call, I mentioned that we were looking into assurance of flow by trying to work sales arrangements with entities that did have firms. So, I thought I may have mentioned it back then. It certainly was a focus at that time. We saw it as the focus when we saw things tightening up. But more importantly, at any one point in time, we would have a percentage of our take-in-kind volumes under anywhere from 6 months to a year-type-term sales agreements. In many cases, all we did was perpetuate those for longer period of time, and then add on to those existing agreements. So hopefully that answers your question, but it was ongoing and it was finalized this quarter.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And I'm sure you can't go into specifics, but given this is a topic de jour now. Can you talk about, given it seems like a decent amount of that was kind of contracted recently, did you find the terms to be that materially different as you kind of went through this more recent contracting, or were service midstream providers still pretty accommodative in getting you that firm sales capacity?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","And maybe it's by virtue of the nature that we've had a strong marketing team in place for many, many years with a number of relationships. We did not have problems getting the capacity in any way, shape or form. And the price basis upon which we obtained the contracts was not exorbitant. In at least one particular case, we took on the firm transport that that purchaser was going to need to take on as part of our price. But surprisingly enough to me, I felt like if things are this tight, it was rather easy for us to line up these contracts.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","I'll just say furthering Joe's point. We believe in relationships, we believe in good relationships with our long-term owners. We believe in good relationships with many of you on this call over time and that we want to be clear, credible and pretty transparent with you on our business and how we manage it. And our marketing group, certainly, exhibits that with good long-term marketing arrangements. And so, I was very impressed with our marketing group's ability to extend those relationships. And as Joe said, we feared that this was a herculean task and it's \u2013 they'd probably cringe for me to say they made it look easy, but it was really relationships that we've established over time so.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And then just as a separate question. Have you guys seen any disproportionate widening of condensate realizations in the Permian, as the kind of overall basin dip has weakened?","G. Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.","John, this is Mark. Yeah, I'm not aware of additional condensate widening. Are you talking about API type deducts, John or....","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, exactly.","G. Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah, not that I'm aware of John. Our realizations in the first quarter were very strong as we continue to move through the year and we'll continue to monitor that. Obviously, all the basin price moves, there could be other ramifications. But through the first quarter, there's been a very strong realizations in the Permian. We're just monitoring that Mid-Cush differential, obviously.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah, if you look at our API gravity throughout the basin, certainly our widest is in Culberson, and we've got pretty good contracts there in place. So, we watch that, but so far so good.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Congrats, again, on the quarter.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Jorden for any closing remarks.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I just want to thank, everybody, you've asked some great questions this morning as we always expect. We're having a good year. We look forward to continuing to execute as I said in my opening remarks. That's where the rubber meets the road. There is a lot of companies out there that have top-tier assets, Cimarex is, certainly, one. And operational capability and consistency of execution is, certainly, a goal we set for ourselves and the goal we expect you to set for us.

My name is Bishonda, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter Earnings and Operations Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mark Burford, you may begin your conference.","Mark Burford","Thank you, Bishonda. I appreciate it. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. Here in Denver on today's call, we have Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; and Paul Korus, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Jim Shonsey, Vice President and Controller. ","We issued our financial and operating results news release this morning, a copy of which can be found on our website. I need to remind you that today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what is to be discussed. You should read our disclosure on forward-looking statements in our 10-K, other filings and press releases for risk factors associated with our business.","And with that, I'll go ahead and turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden","Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone, or good afternoon, at least for us. First quarter 2012 is a good quarter for Cimarex. We reported net income of $106 million or $1.23 per diluted share, and our cash flow from operations this quarter was $303 million, which continues to benefit from strong oil and natural gas liquids revenues.","First quarter 2012 production volumes averaged 603.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day or a barrel of oil equivalent just over 100,000 barrel of oil equivalent per day. Our first quarter 2012 Permian and Mid-Continent volumes hit an all-time high of 554.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day, growing 26% over the same period in 2011.  That growth includes a 50% increase in Permian oil volumes over the first quarter of 2011 to a record 21,800 barrels of oil per day this quarter. ","Overall, oil production also reached an all-time high of 29,562 barrels per day, and that is just a consequence of the strategy we've talked about in the past of emphasizing that Permian Basin and growing our oil and other liquids production. That liquids production accounted for 47% of our equivalent volumes this quarter and comprise 79% of our $411 million of oil and gas and NGL revenue.","Oil price realizations increased 9% this quarter to $99.28 per barrel, while natural gas prices fell 34%, averaging $2.92 per Mcf. Driving our growth are continued good results from our drilling programs. We have a great inventory of strong projects. In the first quarter, we drilled and completed 73 gross, 40 net wells, investing $400 million on exploration and development. Of that total, 50% were invested in projects located in the Permian Basin, 48% in the Mid-Continent and 2% in the Gulf Coast and other.","What I'd like to do now is give you a region-by-region walk through, and I'll start with the Permian. There, we drilled and completed 39 gross, 27 net wells during the first quarter of 2012, completing 95% of those as producers.","Permian first quarter exploration development capital was $201 million or 50% of total capital. So as you can see, we're on a run rate of about $800 million in the Permian, and we'll see what we do going forward depending on our cash flow, our results and costs.","And our New Mexico horizontal second and third Bone Spring play, that's our most active play. Year-to-date, we drilled and completed 13 gross, 6 net wells. And our per well 30-day gross production from the 2012 Bone Spring wells averaged 590 barrels equivalent, that's a Boe per day and 87% of that is oil. Throughout our presentation, you're going to hear us talk about 30-day averages. We think that's the meaningful number in some of these wells. From time to time, I'm going to sprinkle in some instantaneous 24-hour rates, but it's the 30-day rate that we look at and that's one we encourage you to look in the measure of the well.","And getting back to second and third Bone Spring, we're continuing to see very strong results in this program. We're very pleased with our recent wells and how it's trending. And that's a number of reasons, all of which are testament to our exploration and operational folks.","Of note, we've upsized our hydraulic fractures, as has many of our competitors. We've gone from 5 stages to 8 stages per lateral, and we've also done some geoscience we've talked about in the past, and we're seeing lower average water cuts. So really getting that program, delivering some nice solid performance.","Coinciding with these results, our future inventory continues to grow. We see somewhere between 150 and 200 future New Mexico Bone Spring drilling locations on our current land position, and that land position is always increasing. It's a very active lease play for us. This account has a potential to grow significantly as we continue to drill and gather more data.","Moving on to the Texas Third Bone Spring play. There we drilled and completed 5 gross, 5 net Third Bone Spring wells in the first quarter. The wells brought online had per-well 30-day average gross production rates of 800 barrels equivalent per day, 82% of which were oil. So these are very, very nice wells, cost a little more to drill and complete, but very, very nice results.","This program is also proceeding with a solid inventory of future drilling locations, which our current count is near 100 wells on our current acreage and, as before, has the potential to grow significantly with more drilling and more leasing.","And then moving on to our Wolfcamp play, we're continuing to evaluate multiple shale intervals in the Delaware Basin. The majority of our drilling, of course, is focused on the Wolfcamp. We talked about that now for a few of our quarterly calls. Most of our Wolfcamp drilling has been our southern Eddy County New Mexico, a property we call White City, and northern Culberson County Texas. In the first quarter of 2012, we drilled and completed 2 Wolfcamp wells, bringing total in the play to 20 gross, 19 net wells.","Our first 30-day production per-well, this is averaging all of our wells, is 6.6 million cubic feet equivalent per day, and that's comprised of 3.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day -- or excuse me, 3.1 million cubic feet per day of gas, 250 barrels per day of oil and 340 barrels per day of natural gas liquids. Or to summarize that, that's 47% gas, 23% oil and 30% natural gas liquids.","So that Wolfcamp play to us is significant in scope. We're currently still delineating it. We have hundreds of locations. As we said in the past, we represent this as very early time in this play. We're still doing a lot of experimenting, both testing the play laterally throughout our acreage, but also vertically. We're testing a section that's 800 to 1,000 feet thick in gross interval, and we're experimenting with different landing zones. But overall, we're very, very pleased with our results in that Wolfcamp play at this point, and that looks to be a major contributor to the future of Cimarex.","Also in the unconventional arena, where there's the Avalon Shale, and as we've discussed in the past, we're also drilling some Avalon Shale wells, especially east of us in Lea County where we began the oil window of the Avalon Shale. We've brought on 2 Avalon wells in the oil window this quarter. One was the Tristy Draw 36 State 1H [ph], where we had 100% working interest, and the Howard 5 Federal 4H [ph] with a 94% working interest. They had 30-day equivalent IPs. And again, this is a 30-day average of 500 to 700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 70% of that was oil. But I'd also add -- they both had peak rates, their 1-day peak rate on both those wells were above 1,000 barrels of oil per day. So very, very nice wells.","Again, it's early time for our understanding of Avalon, but it looks like it has significant potential for us for hundreds of future locations, significant potential for reserves and production upside, but we're still learning our way forward in that Avalon play.","Moving on to the Mid-Continent. In the first quarter, we drilled and completed 33 gross or 12 net Mid-Continent wells. Mid-Continent first quarter exploration development capital was $180 million or 48% of our total first quarter capital. Now the bulk of that is Cana, or Cana-Woodford play. And at quarter end, we had 39 gross or 18 net Cana-Woodford wells waiting on completion. ","At year end 2011, there were 13 gross or 4.9 net wells waiting on completion in Cana. Our waiting -- our wells waiting on completion have increased as a result of commencing of infill development during this year. And we've talked about this in the past calls, but we are infill drilling in Cana, and the methodology there is we're drilling somewhere between 80 and 95 wells side-by-side east-west. We get the bulk of those drilled case and then we come in later and start our completion episode, completing them simultaneously. So that's as planned. We have quite a backlog of wells waiting on completion in Cana. We'll see those come on in Q3, and that's exactly as designed.","We currently have 10 rigs running and -- or excuse me, today, we have 9 rigs running in the Cana core. We just moved the rig to the Permian. And our returns in the core are still good. They're not great, but they're good. If we look at that infill project going from east to west, where the eastern portion is the most liquids-rich portion, the western portion is the driest portion, our return on drilling investment varies from 49% after-tax in the liquids-rich portion to 20% after-tax in the drier portion, and that's our current strip price. So still acceptable returns in the Cana-Woodford. However, we're getting better returns in the Permian. So as we've talked in the past, for the remainder of the year, we'll be shifting some of that capital to the Permian.","We have a lot of flexibility in our Cana investment. We have limited lease expirations. We have very limited rig or other service commitments. So what we're planning on doing is throttling back to Cana a little bit while we watch these gas prices. We're going to go back to 7 rigs in the greater Mid-Continent area. We will probably take from time to time anywhere from 1 to 3 of our Cana rigs in western Oklahoma to test some new emerging ideas. We've talked in past calls about the western Oklahoma, Anadarko Basin being a very active generation program for us. And we have some things lined up that will be from time to time borrowing rigs from Cana in this low-gas environment to test some concepts that are oilier in Western Oklahoma.","And finally, just wrapping up, talking about the Gulf Coast. In the Gulf Coast, we participated in just 1 gross or 0.5 net wells that was operated within our Yegua\/Cook Mountain fairway in the first quarter, and that well was unsuccessful and was a dry hole. We're in the process of shooting and acquiring new seismic data, and we expect to be recharging our inventory and back to drilling in the second half of this year.","So overall, we're seeing our program, the flexibility we baked into it in past years, having a liquids portion, having a high-quality Cana-Woodford program, also having a number of different plays. We're getting some benefits in that. And that even in this rather hostile gas environment, we still have a lot of opportunity to choose from that gets us acceptable returns. Obviously, we're trying to live within the guidance that we've talked about in the past, and we're committed to do that. But we're very pleased with our results thus far and very optimistic about our deep inventory and the opportunity it brings us.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi, our Chief Operating Officer.","Joseph R. Albi","Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'll summarize our first quarter production, update you on our Q2 and full year guidance and then finish up with just a few comments on our current service costs.","Well, Q1 came in for us just about as planned. We reported average net daily equivalent production of 603.5 million a day. That was up 2 million a day from our Q4 '11 reported figure of 601.4 million a day and fell just about at the midpoint of our guidance, which was 595 million to 615 million a day.","Our production during the quarter was slightly impacted by some pipeline and facility shut-ins in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent. Those shut-ins impacted our production by approximately 6 million a day. And without them, we would've come in, obviously, at the upper end of our guidance.","With our continued focus on the Permian and the Cana, we once again set a few records during the quarter. Tom mentioned a few, 4 of them all mentioned. Our Q1 Permian oil production of 21,800 barrels a day is a record, that's up 14% from Q4 '11 and 50% from Q1 '11.","On the equivalent basis, our first quarter Permian production came in at 240.3 million a day, that's also a company high, up 12% from last quarter and 38% from a year ago. And although we were impacted to the tune of about 3 million a day in facility shut-ins during the quarter in Cana, our Q1 equivalent net Cana production of 161.3 million a day is also a new record, up 2% from Q4 and a respectable 56% from Q1 '11.","As Tom mentioned, driven by the Permian, our total company Q1 oil production of 29,562 barrels a day was a new record. That's up 8% from Q4 '11 and 10% from last year. While our total company liquid production of 47,249 barrels a day also set a new high mark for us, up 6% from last quarter and 8% from a year ago. During Q1, liquids now make up 47% of our total production, that's up 3 points from the 44% that we saw one year ago.","As compared to 4 '11, on an equivalent basis, our Q1 total company production of 603.5 million a day was up 2 million a day, with the Permian being up 25 million a day, the Gulf Coast down 21 million a day and the Mid-Continent down slightly at 2 million a day. And this, again, as I mentioned earlier, primarily result of the pipeline at facility shut-ins that we saw during the quarter. ","As we mentioned during our last call, we now see the headwind of our past Gulf Coast declines to be behind us, and it's reflected in our year-over-year numbers. As compared to Q1 '11, our Q1 '12 total company production was up 13.4 million a day, with the Permian up 66.6 million a day, and the Mid-Continent up 47.8 million a day. That's a combined increase of 114.4 million a day, which more than offset the 101.3 million a day drop we saw in the Gulf Coast over the last 12 months.","So as we look forward into Q2 and the remainder of the year, as we mentioned when we first issued our 2012 guidance, the significant portion of our anticipated 2012 production gains were projected to occur in the latter half of the year. And Tom alluded to this, this is driven primarily by our Cana infill well frac schedule. ","Well, that picture hasn't changed, and as we modeled at the beginning of the year, our Q production -- Q2 production is forecasted to be relatively flat to Q1 as a result of basically 2 items: Number one, our anticipated Gulf Coast production decline, albeit a relatively small drop of 8 million to 10 million a day from Q1 to Q2; and two, the buildup of our completions that we have with the Cana infill project.","As of March 31, we had 39 gross or 18 net Cana wells waiting on completion, with our infill frac activities slated to begin here in late May and then continue to the end of the year. So with this frac schedule, the production adds associated with the infill project are really projected to make an impact on our production in Q3 and Q4.","With knowledge of some significant Q2 pipeline facility shut-ins and likely at a rejection associated with our processed gas in Cana, as many of you have written or read, we've reduced our second quarter guidance by approximately 10 million to 12 million a day, which resulted in a projected Q2 guidance range of 580 million to 680 million a day for the quarter.","Incorporating our new Q2 estimate into our full year model, results in a revised 2012 guidance range of 612 million to 613 million a day. The current full year model calls for a Gulf Coast production to drop to levels of 25 million to 30 million a day by Q4, with combined Q4 Permian and Mid-Continent volumes to be in the range of 625 million to 650 million a day, up a respectable 18% to 22% from our Q4 '11 combined Permian and Mid-Continent equivalent volume of 531 million a day.","So outside of the external impacts on our Q2 production, the bottom line to our guidance is basically that we're about where we thought we'd be at this point in the year. Adjusting our Q2 guidance for the 10 million to 12 million a day of shut-ins and possible ethane rejection puts Q2 right in line with Q1, which is how we modeled it at the beginning of the year, with the impact of our Cana infill program and increased Permian activity projected to boost our Q3 and Q4 volumes.","Shifting gears to our OpEx. Our Q1 lifting costs came in at about 23 per Mcfe. That's up slightly from Q4 and at the upper end of our guidance. The primary component of work here was our slightly higher workover activity during Q1 as compared to quarters passed, with our first quarter workover component of $0.04 per Mcfe from Q4 '11. So with Q1 coming in at $1.23, we bumped our 2012 lifting cost guidance up slightly to about $1.15 to $1.30. ","On the service cost side in general, during Q1, we saw our drilling cost components remain relatively flat, while completion costs appear to be softening a bit. And that's driven primarily by frac service cost reductions and overall prop cost reductions with the use of white sand. Only where we've increased fracture upsizes have we seen completion cost increases.","In Cana, through drilling efficiencies gained by pad drilling, such as mobilization and facility cost savings, utilizing biofuel for -- power for our rigs, installing pipeline infrastructure for water sourcing and disposal and by consolidating our services and equipment, our current Cana core infill AFEs are now running $7.6 million, and that's down from levels of $8 million just 3 months ago.","Our current Permian AFEs have remained fairly well in check since our last call, with improved drill time efficiency, our Paddock-Blinebry vertical AFEs are now running $2 million to $2.2 million, that's down slightly from Q1 and back in line with equivalent costs a year ago. Our 8,000 to 9,000 foot TVD New Mexico second Bone Spring wells are running $5.8 million to $6.5 million, that's flat with the numbers we gave you in Q1, but up 15% to 20% from Q2 '11, and that's, as Tom mentioned, to us increasing our frac size in that program basically going from 5 stages now to 8.","Now as we drill a little bit deeper into the basin and approach TVDs of close to 11,000 feet, we'll see some of these second Bone Spring wells get closer to a $6.8 million to $7 million range. The heart of our activity today has been in the 8,000 to 9,000 foot range.","Our current West Texas Third Bone Spring AFEs of $7.5 million to $8.5 million are again flat with Q1 yet down considerably from where they were a year ago at about $9 million. This primarily a result of us changing our completion design going to cemented liners, fewer stages and using white sand. And our current Wolfcamp AFEs continue to come in at $8 million to $8.5 million, right on track as well with the estimates that we provided last call. ","So in a nutshell, for us, Q1 came in about as planned. Adjusting for known Q2 pipeline facility shut-ins, our second quarter looks relatively flat to Q1. Our model continues to call for strong Q3 and Q4 production growth from the Permian and the Mid-Continent. Our service costs appear flat with signs of softening on the completion side, and our program efficiencies continue to improve our total well cost as we've evidenced with our Cana infill project.","So with that, I'll turn that -- I'll turn the call over to Paul, our Senior VP and CFO.","Paul Korus","Thank you, Joe. Consistent with our track record, our earnings release is probably once again noteworthy in that it doesn't contain any surprises. Our operational and financial results were good and generally in line with guidance and other expectations. I would say that the earnings and cash flow numbers were very clean, so I don't think they require any further explanation.","However, I would like to comment and update you on the right side of the balance sheet. Subsequent to quarter end in early April, we issued $750 million of new 10-year Senior Notes priced at par to yield 5 and 7.125%. We used the proceeds to repay our old $350 million of 7.125 % Senior Notes that were due in 2017 and to repay bank debt that we had outstanding at the time. I probably should add in case any investors are on the line, thanks very much for your participation in that offering. ","Pro forma for the new notes, we have nothing drawn on our $800 million bank credit facility and approximately $150 million of cash.","Our credits stats after the offering remain strong. Pro forma for the new offering, our debt-to-cap ratio is about 19% and total current debt and projected debt outstanding at the end of this year remain below 1x to our EBITDA or any other measure of cash flow.","We -- our capital projection for the year remains $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, midpoint of $1.5 billion. We think we're very well positioned to fund that with cash flow derived from production this year, proceeds to this offering and perhaps drawing on our credit facility to the tune of $150 million to $200 million by year end.","With that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mario Bizara [ph].","Unknown Analyst","Just wanted to get some color on the Texas Bone Springs. It's just going back sequentially for the past few quarters, you're seeing steadily improving average 30-day rates. I know you commented briefly about using more sand, and what exactly are you guys doing or have you changed in your drilling techniques over the past 6 to 9 months to drive this improvement?","Thomas E. Jorden","Sure. This is Tom. I think primarily, we're in a better area. We've -- for the past couple of years have been a little bit of a tug-of-war on leasing. And there's a part of the play we really like that we haven't aggressively drilled in because we were in lease competition and wanted to not race market players. And that has kind of come to an end, and so we're drilling in some areas that are a little thicker, a little higher oil cut and just better quality rock than some of our prior results. That and the upsized completion, I would say, explains our increasing results.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then you mentioned about looking to still acquire land here. I mean, with the recent debt offering, you still have a pretty solid debt to cap around 19%. What's your appetite for making an acquisition in this market that could be comparable to what you made with Magnum Hunter a few years ago, which got you really a significant position in the Delaware Basin?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, I would say our appetite is strong, but it's about returns to us. And we look at a lot of water package, I assume you're talking about Permian in particular, we look at water packages in the Permian that we like, and we are unwilling to pay what the successful buyers are paying because we don't think the returns are there. Now maybe we're just not seeing it fully, but we see it as we see it. So we're about returns. We love the Permian, but we're generating very nice returns on our internally generated opportunities, and we're able to increase that. I'll answer you straight on, though. We would love to find another opportunity like we had in 2005 when we bought our land to that 370,000 net acre position in Permian. This is -- these transactions today, it's very difficult for us to justify with our return metrics.","Unknown Analyst","Would you consider a new play or are we really just concentrating in the Permian and the Mid-Continent here?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, of course, we consider a new play. We would love to find something that we think generates significant drilling opportunity and would give us another core business area. So yes, we are opportunistic for that. I wouldn't say that we wake up every morning and go look for it, but they tend to kind of find us. And it's one of the strong reasons why we we're trying to preserve some flexibility with our balance sheet in case that were to happen.","Paul Korus","I'll add -- this is Paul, I'll add that in the meantime until the right opportunity comes along, we have -- we can be patient and selective because we are already long drilling inventory in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent area.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then just since talking about the drilling inventory, just last question here. You mentioned about maybe borrowing some rigs in Oklahoma to possibly expand on your drilling inventory. How long or far away are you guys from disclosing a new position or a new play within your current acreage position?","Thomas E. Jorden","I don't think you'd see us come out with some huge threshold announcement. It's not the -- western Oklahoma is our oldest operating arena. And it's also one of most competitive land arenas that we compete in. But I wouldn't expect to see us come out with some new stealth play where we're going to say we have hundreds of thousands of acres. That said, in western Oklahoma, a 20,000 to 50,000 acreage position in the right play can be extremely meaningful to company our size. But I think we're probably targeting something along those lines. We're currently leasing in a couple of areas. But it's very, very difficult, and it's part of our business as usual that we use every day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just had a question on your guidance. If we look at your production guidance for the year, what are the implications in terms of rig activity? I know you mentioned dropping from 10 rigs to 7 rigs in the Cana or in the Mid-Continent region. How many rigs is that emission going to in the Permian?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, we're currently running -- depending on when you quarry us between 13 and 15 rigs in the Permian. And we have the opportunities lined up to increase that, and we're talking about that. As I said earlier, though, one of our disciplines is our -- these low gas prices have some impact to our cash flow and we're trying to manage our capital program with some discipline. And we had a little bit of additional capital in Cana. You know there are a lot of companies infilling out there, and we have a little more non-operating capital in Cana that we initially planned for. And we're going to stay flexible. We'll be probably somewhere between $600 million and $800 million in the Permian this year, and it's going to be a function of our results, rig availability and our cash flow.","Joseph R. Albi","With regard to guidance, this is Joe Albi, with the rig, any type of rig transfer occurring for the most part, in the second half of the year, our 2012 modeling really didn't change, especially considering Q3, Q4 production as from Cana and the Cana infill project, we're basically in complete mode there where any slowdown in drilling activity would more affect the first part of '13 than '12. And on the other side of the coin, moving those rigs into an area like the Permian, we might be able to realize some oil production in Q4 relatively quick. So when we tinkered with those sensitivities in our modeling, 2012 didn't change much.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And I assume, I know you talked about ethane rejection right now in Cana. How long of a period of ethane rejection are you modeling in there?","Joseph R. Albi","Well, that was a topic of conversation between Mark and I, and all we feel comfortable with is just trying to predict about as far as we can see pass our nose. So we only incorporate in what we thought we'd see in Q2, and that was only for the Cana portion.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, if I could switch over briefly, we've seen a lot of attention in the Midland Basin around the emerging plays decline and then the north Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp obviously. What are you seeing -- are you looking at equivalent zones in the Delaware Basin? And what are some of the other horizons that, I guess, you have your eyes on right now?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, yes, this is Tom. Obviously, our Wolfcamp play in the Delaware Basin is the direct equivalent to the Wolfcamp in the Midland Basin. They also pursue a deeper shale, which would be the equivalent of our Penn Shale. We're pursuing that. Midland Basin is different, but it does -- we don't play that. We don't have a big position, although we're studying it pretty hard. I think critical difference is as normally pressured whereas we're overpressured. But we're pretty pleased with our own Wolfcamp so we don't feel a need to race over there and pay top dollar for a big acreage position. We like what we've got at Delaware.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lively.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","On this ethane discussion, can you remind us, one, how much ethane do you guys produce specifically out of Cana? And then what percentage of the Cana barrel is ethane?","Joseph R. Albi","Brian, this is Joe Albi. Here's how I'd look at it as far as how it translates into guidance. And if Mark wants to chime in, please do, Mark. But what we modeled was an impact of about 5 million to 5.5 million a day worth of volumes on an equivalent basis that we'd see as far as a reduction is concerned. When we look at the specifics of it, in Cana, about 24% of our wet gas stream or produced wellhead gas stream is dry, 76% is processed. We look at a May Mid-Continent price of $1.87. Had we not had ethane rejection, we would have received at the wellhead $2.82 -- excuse me, $2.97 in Mcf. And with rejection, it's $2.82. So it's hitting us to the extent of about $0.15 on a wellhead Mcf. But on the other side of the coin, we have a little bit more residue coming off the back side of the plan. So our residue with rejection is about, for 1,000 Mcf into the plant would yield $8.62 per reservoir volumes versus $8.02 had we not had the rejections. So we see about 7.5% increase in our gas, and I think that may help you translate it into Mcfes, which is how we try to look at in our model. I don't know, Mark, if you want to add anything?","Mark Burford","Yes. I guess, we just throw you a question, Brian, of our Cana NGLs in the first quarter produced 6,700 barrels a day of NGLs in Cana. So about all those NGLs, almost nearly half of that barrel is ethane.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Right. My point was more on if you look at the NGL realizations in Q1 at about 36%, the volume impact of rejection is one thing. But by the same token, what are you guys thinking then going forward in terms of actual realizations versus WTI for your NGL base?","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe again. Mark and I looked at that this morning and, I guess, the best way we'd answer that is based on the one other time that we saw rejection, which was August of 2010. We might say that might move a couple of points. So like 36% to 38% or something like that.","Mark Burford","Yes. We have a 34% of WTI in the first quarter, Brian. So yes, if you do your 4% uptick in our realization, WTI is probably reasonable.","Joseph R. Albi","And that's a guess, Brian. That's a market in itself.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Right, exactly. The -- on the Permian, what -- just on average, can you guys provide kind of that same breakdown of ethane for an NGL barrel?","Mark Burford","Yes, Brian, I think roughly the ethane barrel is similar, so half of that's staying there also in 25% propane heavier.","Thomas E. Jorden","And then the Wolfcamp's our biggest probably contributor. I think that is half.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last for me. The Permian, I guess, with some down -- some infrastructure downtime recently, it seems like the differentials are widening and maybe they're starting to narrow now. But can you guys comment at sort of the same commentary, I guess, on the NGL realizations going forward, but what should we expect from the Permian on the oil side?","Joseph R. Albi","As far as receipt price?","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Right. What kind of differentials? I mean, you guys gave some pretty good guidance on expenses, but I'm just looking for more details on the actual realizations side as it relates to crude?","Thomas E. Jorden","Okay. So for -- as an example, the differential that we were seeing between Midland and Cushing in 2011 was running around $0.50, $0.70. In Q1, we saw that on an average basis increased to $1.48. In April, we're guessing, with the preliminary data that we have, that that's probably somewhere close to $3.85 to $3.90 differential. And in May, probably the high $5, $5.85, $5.90. And June, we target somewhere maybe $5.25. So when you compare Q2 differential to where we saw Q1, we're seeing about a $3.50 difference between Q1, obviously on the lower side, and that represents about 75% of our oil. Now we are seeing the reverse, obviously, with Louisiana with our LRS differential. But unfortunately, it's a smaller percent of our volumes now. So we're seeing about a $6 increase there but that's about 5% of our volumes.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And that -- do you think that's transitory in the second quarter? Meaning as you go third and fourth quarter, the realizations should improve? Or do you think the run rate that's kind of there?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, we -- I mean, at some I'd love to hear your thoughts on. But we're hearing the bottlenecking, we're hearing the basin pipeline expansion taken out of the equation. We're hearing that turnaround season's over, that ought to help. And a general line coming on in '13 ought to help. We've got a West Texas Gulf expansion. It should add another 100,000 barrels of takeaway at the end of the year, and then there's always talk about rail. So this is definitely anomaly when you look over time that we've seen something like this. Our hopes, obviously, are that it's not at the end of the second quarter.","Mark Burford","And if you were to ask a commodity trader, if you went into the over-the-counter derivatives market to try to swap or hedge something near -- in that case, it says it does return to normal by September or October.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Duane Grubert.","Duane Grubert - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Can you talk a little about the Gulf Coast reduction in activity? You're still spending about $80 million there. So I'm wondering, have you cut back on your internal personnel that are looking at the Gulf Coast and were truly winding it down? Or is it more that last season's batch of wells weren't so hot and we may still be surprised by a good batch this year?","Thomas E. Jorden","Brian, this is Tom. That $80 million of plan capital and it'll be -- if it comes to fruition, it'll be back-end loaded to the second half of the year. We're in a rebuilding phase. We've got 3 to 5 new 3D programs that are going to be coming into our shop here between now. The first one hit our shop a few days ago. Between now and middle of fall, we'll have 3 to 5 new programs. And it's a constant rebuilding of the inventory, and this is being -- since 2002, when we first played the Gulf Coast, we get new data, we analyze it, we would look for anomalies, we come up with a prospect inventory and we'd get at it. What you're seeing here is because of some permit delays on some federal level [ph]. We lost about a year of debt cycle. So we have a -- probably at least until Q3, you're going to see a level of activity. No, we have not -- in fact, we're increasing our staffs with a little more horsepower, and we'll look at this Gulf Coast data. And I would expect this to be at temporary level. But that said, as you've heard us say in the past, we have no Gulf Coast inventory. It is always build-it and drill-it type deal. So until we get those data sets interpreted, get them analyzed, we wouldn't be able to say anything definitive about where our upcoming inventory is. That $80 million is our best guess for money we set aside.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And there are no more questions at this time.","Mark Burford","Very good.

Please note, this event is being recorded.","Now, I'd like to turn the conference over to Karen Acierno, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Acierno, please go ahead.","Karen Acierno - Director of Investor Relations","Thank you, Pete. Good morning, everyone. Our speakers today will be our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by John Lambuth, VP of Exploration; and Joe Albi, our COO will conclude our prepared remarks. Paul Korus and Mark Burford are also here in the room.","Last night, an updated presentation was posted to our website. We will be referring to this presentation on our call today. As a reminder, our discussions will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risks associated with our business.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Karen, and thanks to everyone who is participating in today's conference. We sincerely appreciate your interest in Cimarex. I'd like to take a few minutes to share some thoughts on the current environment before turning it over to John and Joe for details of our results and our plans for 2015.","Cimarex had a great year in 2014. During this call, you'll hear details of our accomplishments, our challenges, and our prospective as we look ahead into 2015 and 2016. We had some great well results to report. Our operations group achieved outstanding production growth in-spite of some severe weather events and unplanned downtime. We executed on some well time strategic asset purchases and sales.","We finished the year strong and entered 2015 with over $400 million cash on hand. In these difficult times, Cimarex stands out with quality assets, the strong balance sheet and an organization that is eager and ready to face today's new challenges. What a difference a quarter makes.","During October, we met with a number of our current perspective owners in the midst to the drop in oil prices from the mid $90 per barrel to the mid $70 per barrel. At that time, we said that Cimarex would view the changing situations through a lens that focused on three key questions. Does our portfolio contained investments are look attractive at current commodity prices and service costs? Do we have the balance sheet and cash flow to fund these opportunities? And once the overall market psychology and how should that impact our capital discipline? In other words, will the industry slow dramatically and drive service costs further down?","Since that time in October, the situation has deteriorated further, but the conversation still about asset quality, balance sheet held and capital discipline. First and foremost, Cimarex has great assets. Our Delaware Basin assets are providing excellent investment returns in the current environment. Innovation and optimization continue to produce improved well results. Our Anadarko Basin assets are top tiered. The Woodford Shale is delivering solid returns. We've continued to de-risk our Meramec position they are gaining increasing confidence to say that it provides some of the very best returns in our portfolio. We have a great acreage position in the economic sweet spot of the play. John will provide additional details on this.","Secondly, our balance sheet remained strong and we planned on keeping it that way. We do not know how deep or sustained this down cycle will be, preserving a health of the company and our financial flexibility is paramount. Finally, we're committed to being highly disciplined in this volatile environment. We may not have seen the bottom of this correction yet. We do expect to see further service cost reductions. Our go forward approach will be characterized by a mix of long-term and short-term thinking.","We're going to take a long-term approach with our assets and organization. With few exceptions, our 6-rig program can hold our acreage in 2015 without difficulty. We'll let a little acreage go, but it will all be second-tier acreage in which we've had marginal results. Our organization is focused and fully deployed on adding value and capturing opportunity in this environment, and I'll speak more on that in a moment.","We'll take a very short-term approach to our balance sheet and capital investments. Our goal in 2015 is to live within cash flow and cash on hand. We view debt as a long-term commitment, and we are highly reluctant to incur additional debt, until we see commodity prices and service cost stabilize.","Although, we're guiding 2015 CapEx in the $900 million to $1.1 billion range. We aren't really thinking about this as an annual budget. The $900 million to $1.1 billion estimate is a snapshot in time. We remain poised and ready to increase activity on the moment's notice. Our decision to contract the six rigs as the prudent course of action, until we see signs of stability that can have the confidence in the robustness of our investment returns.","At our current pace of activity, will go production 3% to 8% year-over-year. Furthermore, we've projected Q4 2015 exit rate, which is essentially flat or down only slightly from our Q4 2014 exit rate. We can manage this downturn without sacrificing future growth.","Finally, I want to comment on the opportunities with this down-cycle will present. There will be acquisition opportunities. We've already been presented with a number of them, but the bar is high. Any corporate or asset transaction will need to be value accretive from the Cimarex shareholder or we're not interested purely. Our balance sheet gives us great flexibility, and we're under no pressure to do anything other than play it smart. Make sense deals are rear, but will be ready.","Cimarex has a staff that is focused, dedicated and hungry to continue to innovate and optimize. We are not shipwreck victims waiting for rescue. The mandate throughout organization is to figure out how to make a living and drive in today's environment. We're not ideally waiting for commodity prices to bounce back to the pre-correction levels. None of us can know where commodity prices will stabilize, but we are proceeding on the assumption that the days of $90-oil are long gone.","In this new era, the efficient low-cost resource producer will be the one that survives and prosperous. Cimarex is dedicated to emerge from this current environment as a better, more productive company. We're using this downtime to refocus and retool our organization, we'll be measured by what we've always been measured by results and we face this challenge without looking back.","In the end, there is no substitute for great assets, a great balance sheet and an outstanding organization. During 2014, we continued to demonstrate that Cimarex has some of the best assets and the organizational capability in the business.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John and Joe, who will describe the progress we made in delineating and developing our outstanding portfolio.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Thanks, Tom. I'd like to quickly recap our activity in the fourth quarter and for the year before getting into some of the specifics about our new drilling results. Cimarex drilled and completed 87 gross, 53 net wells during the quarter, investing $457 million. 78% was invested in the Permian region and the rest went toward activities in the Cana region including the drilling of both Meramec and Woodford wells.","Our Permian operations are in Delaware Basin, where we grew up 39 net wells during the fourth quarter. Our activities in this area were focused on drilling and completing Wolfcamp long laterals; second Bone Spring wells in our White City area; and Avalon wells. We've had exceptional results drilling second Bone Spring wells in our White City area in Eddy County, New Mexico.","I'll refer you to slide 10 of our presentation which illustrates the uplift we've seen in production using a larger completion. We've gone from nine to 15 stages in order to achieve these results. Similar to the second Bone Spring wells in Culberson County. These wells have a higher gas components than our traditional Bone Spring wells, which increases productivity and improves overall economics. As of today, we have identified approximately 90 second Bone Spring locations on our White City acreage with the vast majority of those being located on acreage, which is currently held by production.","In our press release, we've mentioned results from six new Culberson County, Wolfcamp long laterals. Five of those were Wolfcamp D wells, which had averaged 30-day peak IPs about 2,236 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And while we are very pleased with these results, we continue to work on optimizing our frac design to both maximize IP rates, while also paying close attention to cost. Currently, we have five long laterals flowing back with varying frac designs including some with pure equivalent stages. These wells have been completed are in the early stages of flow back thus no conclusions can be reached yet for these wells.","We've adjusted our Wolfcamp acreage position slightly since our last update, but still have a total exposure of 235,000 potential net acres. In 2015, our Wolfcamp capital will be focused on drilling additional long lateral wells in Culberson County, as well as meeting our leasehold obligations in Reeves County, which will be fulfilled by drilling eight wells in 2015 at a cost of $70 million.","Lastly, in the Delaware Basin, I'd like to give you an update on the status of our fourth pilot drilled in 2014, which is the Stacked\/Staggered Wolfcamp eight pilot in Reeves County. This pilot was designed to test both down-spacing and the viability of landing more than one lateral in the thick Wolfcamp A section. After delays caused by the September flooding, these wells began producing in early December and have been online for about 75 days.","However, due to intermittent downstream processing issues during December, a good number of our Reeves County wells, including this pilot were hampered with sporadic production down times thus making a 30 day IP meaningless for the purpose of this call.","With the addition of a new processing outlet in the area, we anticipate having smoother production information as we get further into the quarter and thus enable us to better determine the true potential of this facing pilot.","Now on to the Mid-Continent region. We drilled 57 net wells in Mid-Continent region in 2014 with 42 of those wells being Woodford wells. We also drilled seven Meramac lineation tests, all of which are now producing. We now have enough production data on six of the seven Meramac wells to provide you with a peak 30 day average IP rate of 10.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day.","As was mentioned in the press release, these wells have a wide range of oil deal. In fact I need to issue a correction to the release and that the oil percentage range for these wells is actually 7% to 55% instead of the 20% to 55% that was stated in the release.","As illustrated on slide 18 of our presentation, you can see that wells on the up-dip side of the line have a much higher percentage of oil averaging 49% versus down-dip wells which average 16%. We are very encouraged with these wells results, especially when you take in account that all of these delineation wells were just 5,000 foot laterals.","Our 2015 plans are to continue to delineate our acreage position with 5,000 foot laterals, while we also embark on drilling a number of 10,000 foot laterals in the Meramec. If we achieve similar uplift and going from 5,000 foot to 10,000 foot, I've seen in other plays, then these wells will generate some of the highest rate of returns within our portfolio drilling opportunities.","Current plans are to invest $70 million in the Meramec drilling in 2015. Regarding our acreage position, Cimarex has approximately 115,000 acres that are prospective for the Meramec, 70,000 acres of which have been de-risked by our and competitor drilling activity.","And then finally, in November, we commenced a seven-section infill development program in the Cana-Woodford shale. Originally planned to be 10 sections, commodity prices caused this year's development to be downsize. We will operate two of these sections. Drilling capital allocated for the Woodford infill program in 2015 is approximately $180 million for both operated and non-operated wells.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","Thank you, John. And thank you, all of you for joining our call today. I'll touch on the usual items, our fourth quarter production, our first quarter and full year 2015 production outlook and guidance and then I'll follow up with a few comments on (13:55) really drove the increase there with Q4 Permian oil volume of 38,246 barrels a day, being at the 11.5% or 3,947 barrels a day over Q3.","Over last year, we've seen exceptional production growth overall in the Permian, not just in Q4. Our Q4 2014 equivalent volume was up 34% or 114 million a day from a year ago and our Q4 2014 Permian oil volume was up 29% or 85,095 barrels a day over the same time period last year. On an annual basis, our average 2014 Permian equivalent production came in at 399 million a day, that's up 79 million a day or 25% over our 2013 average of 320 million a day.","As we anticipated, with fewer net Mid-Continent completions coming online in the latter half of 2014, we saw our Mid-Continent net equivalent volume drop slightly from Q3 to Q4. We completed 35 net wells during Q1 and Q2 of last year in the Mid-Continent, as compared to the 9 that we completed during Q3 and 14 that we completed in Q4. And as a result, our Q4 Mid-Continent equivalent production averaged 488 million a day, down slightly from the 518 million a day that we posted in Q3.","That said, we posted nice production gains overall in the Mid-Continent during 2014. Our Q4 2014 Mid-Continent exit rate of 488 million a day was up 42%, or 144 million a day from Q4 2013. And our full year 2014 Mid-Continent average of 451 million a day was up 30% or 105 million a day over our 2013 average of 346 million a day.","So overall, at the company level, it was a great year for us from a production standpoint. We set record marks in all production categories, whether it'd be oil, gas, NGLs or equivalent volumes, at the company level, as well as at both the Permian and the Mid-Continent regions, we're pretty proud of that.","With the contributions from the Permian and the Mid-Continent, our full year 2014 total company net equivalent production average of 869 million a day was up a 176 million a day or 25% over our 2013 reported average of 693 million a day. When you throw in the 2014 property sales that we had, on a year-over-year, apples-to-apples basis our production growth was 27%.","As we look forward into 2015, our 2015 total company average equivalent volume guidance of 895 million a day to 935 million a day is modeled using the low-end of our 2015 productions or capital projection, and results in the 3% to 8% projected growth over 2014.","The carryover the current geographic focus of our drilling program into 2015, coupled with our reduction in shipping of rigs as we move further into the year, results in our 2015 production growth coming from the Permian early in the year and the Mid-Continent later in the year.","With our current 2015 rig and completion schedules, we're focusing approximately 50 net wells to be completed in the Permian during 2015, with 35 to 40 of those wells projected to come online during the first half of the year.","With that, our current modeling calls for Permian production to continue to grow in 2015 with projected Permian equivalent volumes up 13% to 19% over our 2014 levels.","In contrast, we're targeting 30 net wells to 35 net wells to be completed in the Mid-Continent during the year, but five to six of those wells coming on production in the first half of the year and 25 to 30 coming on in the second half. That coincides with our Cana-Woodford development. With the back-end loading of completion activity, our Mid-Continent production is expected to drop somewhat through mid Q3, and then increase significantly during Q4, and really reaching a peak with the full development of row 4 in December of 2015.","The bottom line at the Mid-Continent level \u2013 is that the Mid-Continent will see relatively flat year-over-year production as compared to 2015 \u2013 2014. As we start-off into the year, we've issued our Q1, 2015 guidance of 920 million to 940 million a day, which incorporates a negative impact of 25 million to 30 million a day for early Permian downtime, associated with weather in January and some pipeline facility maintenance that we're doing in Culberson and Reeves County here in February.","With our current drilling schedule, our projected fourth quarter 2015 exit rate is forecasted to be as Tom mentioned flat to down slightly, compared to our fourth quarter 2014 exit rate. But again this forecast is based on the low end of our capital spending projection, and as Tom emphasized just a minute ago, we have a lot of flexibility in that regard, as we watch the market conditions react accordingly. Any changes in our capital spending will obviously affect our current production forecast.","Jumping over to OpEx, with the continued focused on our LOE, our Q4 lifting cost came in at a $1.05 per Mcfe, puts us in our full year average of $1.08 per Mcfe, right at the bottom end of our guidance of $1.08 to $1.12 and down $0.05 from our 2013 average of $1.13. Our production group is keeping their focus on reducing cost in all areas and we're seeing signs of modest cost relate here in Q1 for items such as saltwater disposal, rentals, chemicals, contract labor and well servicing.","The purpose of the guidance will project in our 2015 lifting cost to come in at a $1.07 to $1.17 which takes into account the front-end loading of our projected higher lifting cost Permian new production in the first half of the year.","Our service costs are concerned with the precipitous drop in industry activity, we've seen significant drops in service cost since just the beginning of the year. First, we saw on the drilling side, and more recently on the completion side. Geographically, the reduction seem to come quicker in the Mid-Continent then in the Permian. Most likely result of the backlog of industry Permian activity during Q3 and Q4, especially on the completion side. That said, current costs are now down in both areas.","On the drilling side, we've seen anywhere from 5% to 15% reductions in day rates and 10% to 20% plus reductions in virtually all other cost components the mud, rentals, bits, directional tools just to name a few. And just recently we've seen drops on the completion side. The significant decreases in all of the major frac cost components whether it'd be sand, transportation, chemicals or service.","As a result, at the total company level, our current average per well frac costs are down about 20% from late Q4 levels, all the while we're pumping on the average 10% more fluid and 40% more sand.","The bottom line is that depending on the program, our total well costs currently are down 13% to 20% from where they were just two months ago. Our current Cana Core Woodford AFE is in the range of $6.8 million to $7.2 million, that's down approximately 14% from the $7.9 million to $8.4 million that we quoted last call.","In the Meramec, with just a half dozen wells under our belt, the current single mile lateral AFEs are running in the $7.2 million to $7.6 million neighborhood, that's down 13% more they were in late Q4.","In the Permian, our focus in 2015 will be the Wolfcamp, primarily in Culberson, primarily during long laterals. The cost reductions we've seen today uphold our projected two-mile lateral in Culberson, down 15% to 20% to levels of $11.3 million to $12.3 million. With our Reeves County two-mile Wolfcamp laterals running slightly higher at $12.1 million to $13.1 million, primarily a result of the need to add for us to run additional string of pipe in certain portions of the Reeves County area.","In closing, we had a great 2014, with strong contributions from both our Permian and Mid-Continent programs. We set new records for the company in all production categories. Both our proved reserves and our net production were up 25% over 2013 with the strong fourth quarter and carryover of our 2014 activity were set up for production growth again here in 2015, despite falling in the range on our capital program, while we preserve our balance sheet.","And with some nice decreases already under our belt, we continue to focus on reducing LOE and total well cost, so as to be that, low cost resource producer to be able to capitalize on whatever the market throws at us here in 2015. We want to commend the organization for the great year that they had in 2014 and for the great job they've done early on in the year retrenching us to make the best and a very successful year for us in 2015.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to question-and-answer.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey Drew.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just wanted to get some color on how are you thinking about capital allocation between Cana and the Meramec, the return is obviously for both programs look great on current prices, but Meramec looks a bit higher. Are there infrastructure needs that prevent you from flipping that to be selling more in Meramec or is it just too early to have a great sensitive production profile there?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah Drew, this is John Lambuth. I'm not aware of any infrastructure issue whether on drilling Meramec or Cana. They have fairly similar production flow stream. So, that's not a hindrance to us in terms of our decisions there.","It really comes down to in the case of Cana or the Woodford shale, there we're pretty much in development mode. And so, there it's kind of that dance we do with our partner Devon and ensuring that we're working together and we've already laid out a plan in terms of what will be developing this year and that's the amount of capital we talked about.","As far as Meramec, really it's still all about delineation for us, further expanding the opportunity set here as far as what acreage is perspective. And then as I stated, there's also the need to get after and get a few 10,000 foot laterals under our belt, get some production history under those to get more confident as to what kind of returns those will generate. So that's kind of the balance we're striking right now for this year as we go forward.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Jerry, this is Tom. I would add to that. A lot of that's baked in. We started this development project in the Woodford last fall. We're pleased to have and the returns are excellent. To the extent that we have additional capital, and it's competing, Meramec is going to be top tier and probably we'll be getting additional capital if indeed we accelerate.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's very helpful color. Then I was just curious, if you've seen longer production history on these upsides Cana completions. Can you talk about the decline rates in the production profile on the new completion versus the old style. Is that just a one-to-one shift up in a curve. Does that come off, that improvement come off somewhat as you get further out in the production profile?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well, this is John Lambuth again. I mean so far we're very pleased with what we're seeing with those upside fracs, and what we're seeing at the production of those wells. We're not falling off, let's say faster than what the \u2013 say the old style frac was doing. And I guess I'll reference you to slide 21 which actually shows some relative data as far as flow back time to both the Golden and the Hartz wells.","Let me also say that we are still not fully optimized within the Woodford when it comes to our frac design, we are currently fracking wells right now where we're testing even more stages and more sand, I will tell you that embedded within that Hartz section which what we're showing you there is an average result of Hartz, we have a number of wells, two of them in particular where we did go to even more stages and those wells definitely exhibited better production rates.","So we're pretty confident that we're actually going to be able to get even more out of this rock based on those results, and again we have some wells right now we're fracking, that we think will lead us to the ultimate design that we'll use as we go forward on well four and its development.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for the color, John.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth with BMO.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, good morning.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Good morning.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","You mentioned the 3% to 8% growth was based on the low end of the budget or $900 million. So, do you anticipate spending at the low end of the range based on this six operated rig program and the range assumes the potential of second half increase? And then, could you give us a sensitivity in terms of growth rate year-over-year, it is a higher CapEx meaning we were to spend at the midpoint this could add an extra 200 basis points or 300 basis points to grow or is this just help your exit rate in 2015?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, this is Tom. I'll \u2013 I'm going to take that in the back going forward. Yeah, we have modeled that. I just want to remind our listeners that it's only been within the last 10 days or 2 weeks that we've seen oil prices inch up slightly and we were in an environment where prices were self-falling so fast and it was very difficult to have any capital model that allows you to make intelligence statements about what your balance sheet would be at the end of the year.","So we made a decision to go to six rigs and we stand behind that decision, even in today's environment we think what is that exactly, where we are to be. So we modeled our production at that low end of our capital. But as I said in my opening remarks, we don't think about this as an annual plan. It is a snapshot in time that's appropriate for today and in fact, we may make a decision to accelerate a rig or two here next week, if we really are confident that the situation is stabilized.","Our capital model for 2015 as we'd currently plan under current conditions, involves us having cash on our balance sheet at the end of the year, and we don't see the need to have cash on our balance sheet. So we do have the wherewithal to increased activity.","Now, guilty as charged that we have not come out with a production model that captures any increased activity. Our production model we released this morning is at that lower level of activity, where I want to just ask for your indulgence in reminding you that was made in a following commodity price environment. So, we'll see as we go, we're poised to accelerate.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","Yeah. This is Joe. Couple of the points I'd like to make with regard to that too, there is so many other factors that play here. Drilling and completion costs, do they reduce further or are they flat? How that affect our activity and our production? The timing of that CapEx. If we were to increase our capital expenditures as of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, is it applied to road drilling in Cana where we drill wells first get them all drilled and then come back and complete them later or is it single wells in the Permian. All these factors really tell us that if we were to accelerate our capital spending this year chances are, it's not going to have an immediate impact on the middle of the year projection and would most likely show itself up in the latter part of the year.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And to that point, what's your ability to accelerate or increase net activity in the Chevron, JVA and if you were to add back rigs with which place do you think would see the first incremental dollar allocated to them?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. We have plenty of locations in the building to bring rigs back into Culberson, with Chevron. We're in constant communication with them, and they see as we see some of the great way to returns we see there. So, we are tied up to do just that indeed, that's one area as we talked about where we see very good returns. But likewise, just north of there in the White City, our Bone Spring wells are generating some outstanding returns as well. And we have a very nice inventory wells permitted, ready to go there as well. And then as someone else mentioned, we have lots of Meramec locations that we can nearly get after as well.","So, this is not a question of the opportunity set, we are ready to go, we're just waiting for the right conditions to tell us it is time to go.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. This is Tom. It's a lot easier to start than stop. The decision to lay down rigs can take 60 days to 90 days depending on the rig and what project it's on. Decision to add a rig can be executed in the matter of couple of weeks. So, we're poised and ready.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And then last question. During the 2009 downturn if memory serves me right, you guys used that as an opportunity to focus on efficiencies and really kicked off the Bone Spring play into Mexico as a horizontal play. Just wondering if there is any less obvious efficiency improvements that are worth highlighting that you're focused on this cycle as you look to do more with less capital?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, yes. This is Tom. We are absolutely looking at becoming better executors at resource play development. We have huge resource plays in our inventory and those involve very complex project management challenges. It involves not only drilling the wells, it involves infrastructure, it involves water sourcing, water disposal, it involves electrification, it involves air quality, it involves a host of things that in order to be a low cost operator, demand is strategic focus.","And in the high growth high level of activity, in some sense, we've been in reactive mode more than the kind of strategic planning mode, there that will take to become that low-cost operator in a lower margin business. And we are absolutely focusing our organization on this challenge. So our organization is highly engaged and we're building plans for when we come back with a roar. And I appreciate your \u2013 reminding us and reminding the listeners of the downturn in 2008, 2009. I think if you look at that periods in Cimarex history, it was some of our finest efforts and we came out of that correction a far far better company than we came into it and we are fully dedicated to do that again.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Gamble with Simmons & Company.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Co. International","Good morning, guys. Couple of things, one on the upside, just looking at some of the well results in the Permian for the quarter. It looked like some of the IPs maybe a little bit short of what you'd recognized through third quarter, but the oil cuts were outstanding, is there anything specific that was being done in each of those plays to change that, or is it just the matter of geography, maybe you could walk through that a little bit?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. This is John. I think in particular, you're making reference to our Culberson long laterals entity (34:47). And you hit it right on the head, one of the biggest factors there is geography. We're obviously delineating more and more of our acreage with those wells. And in some areas, it's very good, in some areas, it's not. And so that's one driver to that. And then the other is, we always are tinkering with our frac design. And some of the newer wells, we've been really pumping a lot of fluid. And quite frankly, and flowing back those wells that will in some ways have an impact on the overall IP 30 rate. We don't think it's really material to the EUR of the well, but it does have some potential impact on the flow back on that well. But mostly, it's geographic diversity as we continue to explore across our large acreage position there.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Co. International","Great. And then maybe on the strategy side of things, Tom you kind of mentioned that it's obviously the flexibility is the keyword, taking it down to six as we've \u2013 if we call a bottom here on crude in the low $50s, looking at the slide that you have provided.","The (35:53) are still pretty impressive in multiple areas. And when you think about ramping capital up from the low-end, do you need to see improvement in the oil price to make that happen or do you just need to have \u2013 I guess from a company standpoint, some reasonable certainty or some reasonable comfort with the current levels because even at current levels it seems like your returns are more than acceptable?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Brian, you hit the nail on the head there. We have great assets, and there's lot of things I am grateful for. There is no substitute for asset quality, and we have great assets. Assets that in today's climate with current costs and current service costs generate very-very nice returns. So, that's not a barrier, just picking up activity. It's we want them to just become convinced that we can see a stable future. There is still some speculation out there that we haven't seen the bottom in the oil markets.","And the last thing we want to do is get out there and accelerate and then see oil slide into the $30s. Now, maybe that's not going to happen, maybe we've seen the bottom, and if you're willing to call it on this call Brian, I think that'd be great.","We're just going to watch this a little while. And I want to be clear here, we're not committing to what a little while means. We may go next week and say, it's time to add a rig or two, but we want to be very forthcoming with you today as to how we see it and our most prudent course of action is to say you know what, we're just going to watch this until it clarifies. So no, we have great assets and we think our assets can generate acceptable returns in today's commodity pricing.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Co. International","Great. And then one quick last one on the Meramec, you mentioned either the plans or the future possibilities of drilling 10,000 foot laterals, are we drilling a 10,000 foot Meramec in 2015, should we expect that before year-end or is that a 2016 event?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. We definitely are drilling in 2015. In fact, we have one come up here real soon on the schedule. We right now have three scheduled and really in drilling those, we're trying to place them close to \u2013 we have an established 5,000 foot lateral that way we can measure the uplift and get a good sense of is that a good investment decision for us. So, we have quite a few planned for 2015 and as we get that data and get the production data in hand we'll give you an update on it.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Co. International","And John, do you want to throw an approximate AFP on that 10,000 foot?","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","This is Joe. I'd probably run it somewhere in the $11 million to $12 million range.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Co. International","Great, Joe. It's very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Allman with JPMorgan.","Joe D. Allman - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC","Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Joe.","Joe D. Allman - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC","Hi, Tom, I know, we're just trying to figure out what you guys are going to do next week or next month. But can you just help us think about 2016 in terms of \u2013 I know you're not going to give your budget, you don't have one but just give us kind of the guidelines and the parameters given that as of right now you're going to be running six rigs, would you expect to see production decline in 2016, given the status quo? You mentioned you expect to have cash on hand, would you expect to have cash on hand at the end of 2015 close to the level at the end of 2014? And anything in particular to consider about 2016 from an operations perspective?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me take the last question first. No, we're going to \u2013 the cash on hand issue \u2013 we currently model somewhat less than $100 million cash on hand at the end of this year. And as I said, we don't see any virtue in keeping cash on our balance sheet. So, I would not anticipate that we have cash on hand at the end of 2015 that would be comparable to 2014.","Now as we look into 2016, we are looking at plans for when will be the appropriate time to accelerate and after that balance sheet is formed, and we've said that for years and we mean it. So we're willing to tap that balance sheet as long as our investment returns are excellent, and as we've always said they can stand that downside test.","So, you know Joe, the issue is accelerating in 2016, is what's the downside test? In October, when oil was $75, we pulled our group together, and said, look, let's run a new flat case on oil of $50. And at the time, we thought, well, that's just ridiculous, and we blew right through the bottom of that.","So, before we would make a decision to accelerate, we would want to have confidence in knowing what our downside case was because we wouldn't want to borrow and wake up and find that our credit statistics are well outside the balance of what we're comfortable with. So, we have not abrogated growth in 2016 under any way, shape or form. We think we have the assets demanded and the balance sheet that supports it. But as you started out your question, we are taking this in kind of day-by-day right now.","Joe D. Allman - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC","Okay. It sounds \u2013 that's helpful. And then a different question maybe it's for Joe or for John. You guys talked about 4Q, 2014 to 4Q, 2015 flat-to-down slightly. Could you just give us a break out by product, oil \u2013 how do you see oil over the same timeframe and that gas and NGLs?","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","Mark, you want to add.","G. Mark Burford - VP-Capital Markets & Planning","Yeah Joe. Yeah I'll take that. This is Mark Burford. We look at our production mix and the combination or components or commodities, Joe. We see it fairly stable oil, gas, NGL mix. In the fourth quarter, we averaged 49% gas, 27% oil and 23% NGLs and look out into 2015 it might be a percent of variability in oil, as Joe mentioned the front-end loaded nature of the Permian and then the second nature of the Beacon (42:24) into the fourth quarter for our average 2015, oil breakdown is still about 48% gas and oil 29% and 22% NGL. So very similar mixture of oil, gas, NGLs going into 2015 with some variability quarter-to-quarter depending on the ramping of the Permian in the first half of the year and ramping in the second half of Mid-Continent.","Joe D. Allman - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC","Okay. I think it's helpful. I'll work with that and contact to you guys offline, but just one final question with the new completion designs, are you increasingly confident that not only are you increasing production, but you are actually increasing reserves per well?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. I think we are gaining confidence with every months of more production day that we have from those wells yes, so they clearly are getting \u2013 they're giving book at a higher EUR. And so now, we don't think this is in anyway just acceleration. I would also point out though that, we are really-really focused way to return. And so way to return in some ways is really driven by those first three months of production and clearly these wells are generating much higher production rates than what the over spot fracs were doing.","Joe D. Allman - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC","All right. All very helpful. Thank you guys.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","This is Joe Albi. I wanted to clarify some to the previous question on the two-mile Meramec. Our current AFEs are probably closer to range of $10 million to $11million rather than $11 million to $12 million.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Matt Portillo with TPH [Tudor, Pickering, Holt]","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, all.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Just one quick clarification on the cash comment. You mentioned that you could be down to $100 million in cash by the end of 2015 and I was just curious, under that scenario and kind of the $900 million capital program, what commodity deck would you be assuming to kind of generate that sort of cash draw down?","G. Mark Burford - VP-Capital Markets & Planning","Yeah, hi Matt. This is Mark. Yeah. We have run (44:33) primarily measure when we look at our cash flow projections in that one that we're looking at more recently was Friday the 13 strip price that we most recently ran into that, that's about $56 oil, about $3 gas \u2013 and into that strip environment, and strip price, that price environment we were looking at just a little south of $100 million in cash exceeding the year at the $900 million capital plan.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, perfect. And then I guess just a follow-up question in regards to the activity levels. I believe the majority of the rigs here are under contract right now or are currently running in the Cana. As you guys wrap up your operated drilling program in the first half of the year, how should we think about kind of rig allocation between the Cana and the Permian into the back half of 2015?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. This is John Lambuth. Essentially, by the time we hit June \u2013 May, June, we will be at the six rigs. Three of them will be operating in Mid-Continent and three of them will be in the Permian region.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you. And then, my final question just is in regards to your 2015 plans in the Wolfcamp in Culberson County. You guys highlighted you're focusing in the Wolfcamp A and D, and I assume the D is because of the strong well results you've seen so far and the ability to hold the depths in the A, given the higher oil cut, could you talk a little bit about the Wolfcamp C wells, you've seen to-date and how does that compares on a rate of return basis or how that fits into your program in the medium term?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah, this is John again. Well, clearly right now, both the D bench and the area are generating the best returns for us in that particular acreage block in Culberson. Our C results are not as strong, as they are in the D and the A. We still need to do some work on the C to try to get it to a level that it would justify further expenditure for us. Now, again, you made a good point there. By drilling our D wells, we don't sacrifice those opportunities in the future. And indeed as we keep working at it, we see may at some point raise its level from a rate of return standpoint that we'll want to go and capture it. But right now, today, based on our results, it's the D and the A that clearly shine best in that region.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I might add to that, this is Tom. Well, we're going to full resource development. There is a pretty good chance, we're going to exploit all three of those benches and not leave those reserves stranded. So we've a lot of work to do and plan for that. We're not for \u2013 if it's a-la-carte the A and D are certainly sharing the day for this \u2013 it's full payable service. We're going to probably develop that C simultaneously.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ipsit Mohanty with GMP Securities.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. My first question is on Meramec. You showed a variation in oil cut across up dip and down dip and not to know \u2013 knowing you guys don't throw out a curve without adequate confidence in the play. How does your program look like in 2015? Are you going to focus on up dip, and have you held what is needed to be held by production? Any more color that you can provide?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah, this is John. Let me first say on the acreage side of things. Of our upside acreage, almost 85% of it is already HBP. And so we really don't have much of the lease exploration issue at all for the Meramec for us, and what little we have will be easily satisfied with the wells we have planned both this year and the coming years. So that's not of a concern to us. In times, what are we targeting? We are still trying to fill our way across this fast position as to where are the best returns.","Clearly, some of those up dip wells are outstanding wells. But I will also tell you some of the down dip wells have some phenomenal gas rates associated with them, and still generate very nice returns even for 5,000 foot lateral. So right now as far as 2015 goes, we are not going one area using other we are again trying to expand the opportunity set with our delineation wells. And then we'll see as we go further long. But again, right now, the returns look good whether on one side of that mine or the other right now.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I just wanted to add. This is Tom. It's the wrong viewpoint only to look at commodity mix, when you look at the Meramec. A very very significant over (49:13) is pressure. And as in so many place up dip to down dip, you go from essentially normally pressure to overpressure. And we think we really like our position in aggregate and we've got a lot of energy in that reservoir, we're over pressured, where we have our acreage. And I'm not sure if the map was all clean and we're releasing today, we're not clear (49:38) for our acreage exactly where it is.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Okay. And then just looking at the first quarter, is it going to be very frontend \u2013 frontloaded with completions? Are you going to exhaust your entire backlog coming from 2014? And my related question would be, would you run if you keep your rigs as is, would you run a risk of not having kind of any headroom or any kind of backlog going into 2016?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John, with our rigs moving from the Permian and to the Mid-Continent, we're obviously going to finish up all the completions that we have in the Permian. So as far as future wells are concerned, we've got a number of them permitted and queued up and ready to go. So it's just a matter of drilling on them and then getting them fracked and back on the frac schedule. If I understood your question...","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think the only comment I'd add is that, are waiting on completion well (50:35) against the derivative of, I don't know, which are running and assist (50:41) the client from completing drilling the well and completing it, that's what the backlog as of the year-end represented albeit we're low (50:47) on our rig counts, that backlog will decrease until this represent what (50:51) that rig finishes drilling?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","So certainly, by the way, we're looking at it from a capital expenditure standpoint. We don't say drilling or completing, we just say dollar spent. And that carryover evolves from 2014 and 2015 as capital associated with them, that we incorporated and we're fine and that's completion capital.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Got you. And with predominantly, you're moving into longer laterals, extended laterals. I was just curious if you've got the operational risks that are generally associated with during such laterals if you got it into science now, looks like you're. But if you can talk about how well you understand the risks involved in drilling such laterals, especially when you are in a capital constrained environment?","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","This is Joe. Knock on what we are gaining that that efficiency in our operations and find very, very comfortable drilling two-mile laterals whether it's in Cana in the Woodford or the Meramec or in the Wolfcamp.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks. Good morning. I guess first of mine is on the Cana program, correct me if I'm wrong, I think in the past call or early last fall or late last summer, you'd initially talked about I think a full 10 section development as a part of that infill program versus like seven now. Is it right, number one, I want to guess is that right?","And then number two is, is it right to think about that as your just \u2013 you'll still be developing that full 10 section row, but it will just take longer and so that program that really then just bleeds into 2016 and provides a nice tailwind as you move into the 2015 period?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well, this is John and you're absolutely correct. Again that as we're planning for this well development, given our commodity prices, we have fully expected to do 10 sections led to development. Commodity prices have changed. And so right now, a number of the sections we find right now not to be of a sufficient return that we want to make the investment today. Those sections don't go away, they're always BT (53:19). So, we have made the election to only develop seven of those for now and just essentially save the other three for another day when commodity prices justify making an investment then.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. So, it sounds like maybe it's more about the economic sensitivity of the unit as oppose to just overall decision to slow the pace of the development of...","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it was a little of both. I mean the wells that we've decided not to drill this year are down the drier gas portion, but they still generate reasonable returns. And depending on our results with the infill project, we've discussed as recently as this morning that we could add additional development sections on to that development this year. And so, that certainly I would say this, an additional extension of that development program is among our options that are active that we wanted to up our capital slightly this year.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","And I'll call off with that. Tom's absolutely right and that couple of those sections are queued up permitted ready to go and we have that optionality. And so, don't be surprised if indeed we add on from seven. We will \u2013 Mark, obviously make that decision as we monitor the commodity prices, as well as our capital and what we want to do.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay, great. That's helpful. And maybe it's a little too granular, but is it fair to say that that's the low point from a quarterly perspective this year would be second quarter. Is that the right way to think about it?","G. Mark Burford - VP-Capital Markets & Planning","Actually Michael, this is Mark again. This is actually our third quarter will likely be our low point for the year, but (55:05) activity in Permian in the first quarter and second quarters as it'll be growing, it's going to be pretty flat and in the third quarter it'd be \u2013 it looks like our low quarter.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think (55:14).","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Ish, we'll put a big ish after it.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. And then last one's on mine, I think on the Meramec good update there. I guess any way you provide a range of the DOE or MMTSE (55:37) flow rates across those fits, I'm just trying to get a sense for like you said there is maybe quite a bit of dry gas rate associated with those down dip wells. I'm just trying to better understand how the distribution looks around that average?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean for now we've elected to give you the average rate for those wells. I'll just put it this way, there is still a lot of drilling to do and there is also quite frankly some leasing to do. So as much as we're very proud of these results. There is still a lot to be done here. So I think what we've given you is I think is a good snapshot of the kind of results we're having right now.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. Great. And then...","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","(56:28) in that average. These are really good wells.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. On the economic comparison you put on slide 20. Is that well I assume that's the averages of the hydrocarbon mixed in average well or is that...?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. That's just not taking a generic type curve for both ways. And giving you an idea of what those returns are like. But clearly, depending upon where you are those numbers can swing quite a bit one way or the other but that's just the generic type curve the book plays (57:01).","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Great. It's all very helpful color. I appreciate it.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Yes. My question, and going back from there, Meramec has turned around to understand (57:22) it's still delineating. So far, the wells have been \u2013 they have been really good. So, should we think of this spread as having very low exploration risk, and really what I'm after is, how continuous is this interval, or how heterogeneous the play really is and so how many more wells would you need to truly understand the reservoir architecture?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well, I'll try to answer that first. This is John. We did talk about on an acreage position that we consider to be delineated, meaning that from those wells, we feel very good about going forward from an investment decision.","I will tell you and again, Tom mentioned this, we've been very pleased that along those wells that formed that average \u2013 as Tom said, there's not a dog among them. And so, that does, in some way, speak to the lateral consistency of results that we're getting across that position. And then, so that's encouraging, very encouraging to us.","But we're only technically seven wells into it. So hang on, let us get more wells drilled. But so far, I would say, we're very encouraged again for that immediate variable, we drilled our wells to the consistency we've seen from the production of those wells.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Irene, this is Tom. I mean, we're in the business of being romanced by upside and the Meramec offers tremendous romance. And one of the things that we don't know and I really want to be clear, we don't know \u2013 we don't know what the spacing will be. But we also don't know if there will be multiple zones. I mean the Meramec is a fixed section.","And there are some of our competitors out there testing stack laterals and as we look at that section and we have indeed varied our own landing zone, as we drill these wells, we will be testing that there could be multiple zones in the Meramec, possibly a couple of layers to this. So, we just don't know. And John's point is really the right one that with just six wells or seven wells an area this large, we have a lot of work to do before we can really get too granular with it on what this asset can deliver. So, I think, very encouraging so far.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","It's great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the last question today comes from Cameron Horwitz with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Cameron J. Horwitz - USCA Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Hi, Cameron.","Cameron J. Horwitz - USCA Securities LLC","Hey Tom, you referenced in deal flow early in the call. I was hoping you could just talk about what you're seeing out \u2013 out there from that perspective. I guess asset quality wise, if you've seen any reconciliation of some of the wide bid\/ask spread that we've heard so much about?","And also maybe just the competitive landscape? And how that's maybe changing here over the last few months, seems like there's been quite a bit of an influx of private capital competing, looking to take advantage of some of the same opportunities that you all are, so hoping you could just give us some color there?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'd be happy to and none of what I'm about to say is news to you. There's a lot of capital in our sector in chasing opportunities, and there's a lot of private equity money on the hunt. Now there are some assets for sale and they're good assets, but there is still that bid\/ask spread. I think that there's still a sellers' intent to try to find last year's work if you will, I mean, I think \u2013 I think asset prices have to rationalize around current commodity over look and we haven't seen that yet.","There is also corporate opportunities that get whispered to us from time-to-time, we've looked at a couple of them and wouldn't surprise you to hear that some of these companies have a lot more debt than we do and when we do a pro forma, we're \u2013 you got to just love the asset in order to take on that burden. And it's \u2013 as I said the outset, our hurdle is high, but \u2013 I think a lot of these management teams out there are going to try weather through this to the extent they can, it's just going to be a function of how brutal does this get and how sustainable it will be.","As I said in my opening remarks, we're not waiting around for a recovery, I mean at Cimarex we've got assets that can work in this environment and we're getting our cost structure, so that we can move forward and not looking back. And I think there is going to be have to be more sellers with that viewpoint before there's going to be pricing that makes sense.","Cameron J. Horwitz - USCA Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for the color on that Tom. And then can you just talk about how Ward County kind of fits into the strategic picture, I think you talked about that somewhat falling down in terms of the (62:16) on the Wolfcamp and just some of the challenges there some of the water and stuff. Can you talk about and how you think about Ward County is that they're better potential monetization candidate for you or is that just kind of wait and see how things evolve. How are you tracking that in obviously a much more constrained environment?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. It is clear to us that Ward County currently based on our drilling results doesn't compete versus Reeves or Culberson and that was even true at a much higher oil environment and there are challenges in Ward County that we've yet really been able to overcome with our drilling program. That said, we don't have a lot of exposure this year. I think at last we're looking at about 3,000 acres of explorations in 2015. And so and as much as we're not going to be actively drilling there. We will certainly be monitoring other companies who have assets around us who will be drilling, and pay careful attention on what they do. But I'll just say as of right now, we have no plans to do any drilling this year for Ward County.","G. Mark Burford - VP-Capital Markets & Planning","And we haven't really explored monetizing it. I think our \u2013 always our first preference is to figure it out, and Joe and John's right we're going to be starting it, and watch our competition carefully.","Cameron J. Horwitz - USCA Securities LLC","Thanks, Brian.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Cameron, (63:44), once the Culberson County is going to work and now it's out there in our portfolio.","Cameron J. Horwitz - USCA Securities LLC","Sure. I appreciate all the color. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And with that, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.","Karen Acierno - Director of Investor Relations","I don't think we have any comments, just thanks for participating, and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to Karen Acierno, Vice President and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Karen Acierno","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2019 conference call. An updated presentation was posted to our website yesterday afternoon, and we may reference that presentation on our call today. As a reminder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements, a number of actions that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements on our news release and in our 10-Q, which was filed yesterday, and of course, our latest 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the risk factors associated with our business. ","We'll begin today our prepared remarks with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, and then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on operations including production and well cost. A replay of expiration, John Lambert and Margaret Ford are here to answer any questions you might have. [Operator Instructions]. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Jorden","Thank you, Karen, and thank you to all that joined us on the call this morning. Cimarex had a good second quarter in a challenging market environment. Our production, both barrel of oil equivalent and oil production, came in above the midpoint of our guidance range. Total oil grew 5% sequentially with Permian oil growing almost 9% sequentially. Oil growth is projected to continue with sequential growth expected for the remainder of 2019 and into 2020. Permian oil growth is expected to offset the declining volumes in the Mid-Continent. We reaffirmed our CapEx the full year while raising our annual guidance by 1000 barrels per day and midpoint. Commodity prices had an impact on our cash flow and earnings this got it. With the price environment we're faced, particularly for natural gas and natural gas liquid, it would have been foolish to expect otherwise. However, in spite of these headwinds, we expect to exit the year without incremental borrowing. Furthermore, we are pleased to be returning cash to shareholders in the form of our dividend, which we intend to grow over time. ","We're bringing some outstanding projects online that are delivering excellent fully but in return. As we look ahead, we are completing the transaction to a more consistent operational cadence. Field consistency provides our best opportunity for consistent returns, value creation and cash flow generation. Constant stops and starts lead to field inefficiencies and increased cost. Our organization is focused on free consistency, smooth execution and cost control. We continue to benefit from the tremendous work we have put into understanding resource site development. As we've said in the past, optimum development comes from understanding fourth quarter element: first, understanding the stimulated fractured network, both along the borehole and away from the borehole; second, understanding parent\/child interface and reservoir effects; third, understanding proper well spacing; and forth, configuring an optimum project size and design. Cemex has discussed our learnings on each of these 4 key points. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. The optimum answer to each of these 4 issues is a function of the reservoir properties, infrastructure requirement and economic conditions. Through years of testing, we have gained a good and growing understanding of the requirement for profitable development within good capital efficiency. I would, again, referring to slides 24 and 25 in our presentation, which provides a window into our approach on the well spacing issue. ","As we've studied development projects in all of our operating areas, we have grown more confident in our ability to design capital-efficient development projects, to observe projects through our operating areas and to predict their outcomes. This has also give us insight to stand out of some non-operated projects. Our results, thus far this year speak for themselves. We wouldn't be making a detailed comments in our productivities in a prepared remarks, I'll give you a quick overview of 2019, of course, we're open to answer any additional questions you may have. ","As you know, our 2019 capital is primarily allocated to the definition, with majority going to Upper Wolfcamp did mention Professor, breeze and Lea County. Four of the 5 Culberson developers are online. Three of the 5 Reevs development expected online in 2019 are already producing Andrew Obin, our single development in Reeves County this year is currently flowing back. We have 3 additional that would be on production later this year. Operations underway on several projects that will impact 2020. ","We currently have 8 rigs running in the Delaware along with 2 completion crew. Now I'll turn it over to Joe Albi, who will discuss operations in more detail.","Joseph Albi","Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll touch on our second quarter production, our Q3 and 2019 full year production guidance, and then I'll finish up with a few comments on LOE and service cost. With the nice jump in our second quarter production, we continue with our strong start to 2019. Our Q2 net equivalent production came in at the company record of 275,000 BOEs per day, right at the top-end of our guidance range of 263,000 to 275,000 BOEs per day. With the mark, our Q2 '19 net equivalent production was up 6% over Q1 '19 and 30% over Q2 '18. ","On the oil side, our company record Q2 oil volume of 83.4000 BOEs per day came in early 1,000 barrels per day above our guidance midpoint, and was up 5% and 35% from our Q1 '19 and Q2 '18 postings, respectively. The Permian drove the increase. With our Q2 Permian oil volume of 70.7 [indiscernible] per day, up 45% over the 48.8000 barrels a day we produced in Q2 '18. With the posting, the Permian now accounts for 85% of our total company or production. ","As we look forwarded into 2019, we're reiterating our full year 2019 capital guidance and activity levels. We've tightened our full year net equivalent production guidance to 263 to 262 MBOEs pay day, keeping the same midpoint as our previous guidance, and we've raised the midpoint of our full year net or production guidance by 1,000 barrels per day with the range of 83,000 to 87,000 BOEs per day. With Q3, we are projecting net equivalent volumes to average 265 to 279 MBOE per day, with our net oil volumes forecasted average 85,000 to 91,000 barrels per day, up approximately 5.5% from the midpoint -- at midpoint from Q2. ","Shifting over to OpEx. With revenue properties now on our books, our Q2 lifting costs came in at $3.51 per BOE. That's just slightly above the midpoint of our guidance of $3.20 to $3.70, and it's down $0.11 per BOE from our 2018 average of $3.62. ","With our continued Permian focus, retightening our full year lifting cost guidance within the range of $3.30 to $3.65 per BOE. And lastly, some comments on growing and completion costs. We've seen general market conditions remain relatively flat since our last call on both the ruling and the completion side. That said, with our continued focus on challenging completion design and operating efficiency, we've reduced our completion by 5% to 6% since April, which transition to an attractive total well cost reduction, or reductions in the range of $300,000 to $500,000 for each of our 2-mile lateral wells depending on the program. And our Wolfcamp program, with the tweak in our completion design, we've dropped our 2-mile completion APV by $400,000. As a result, our generic Reeves County, 2-mile Wolfcamp well is running $10 million to $12.5 million, depending on facility design and frac logistics. That's down $400,000 from last call, and down $900,000 from our estimate late last year. Our shallower Wolfcamp A wells in Culberson County are running about $600,000 less than Reeves County Wolfcamp A wells, within AFE of $9.4 million to $11.9 million. I want to point out that with the efficiency gains derived throughout our multiple development drilling projects, our average treatment well -- development project per well costs are funding at the low end of these ranges. And in the Mid-Continent, with refined completion design improved operating efficiencies, we've reduced completion costs in both our Woodford and Meramec programs. ","Our current 2-mile Meramec AFEs are running $9.5 million to $11 million. That's down another $500,000 from the last call, down $1 million from late 2018 and down more than $2 million from the cost we quoted in early 2018. ","So in closing, our solid second quarter gives us a great springboard into the second half of the year. With 9 net wells previously planned for early Q3 first production coming online during the last 2 weeks of June, we are forecasting a rent ramp in our production in Q3 and Q4, resulting in an increase for our full year oil guide of 1,000 per day at the midpoint as compared to our guidance last call. Our cost structure is healthy. We're projecting similar full year lifting costs guidance to -- as compared to last call, and we've derived significant well cost reductions through efficiency and completion design. We remain very well-positioned to deliver the capital activity and production plan that we laid out for you at the beginning of the year. So that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. You're first question was from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Tom, was wondering if you could elaborate on some of your prepared comments when you're talking about your expectations on sequential growth into the second half of the year per your guide and into 2020? And how you're thinking about capital allocation next year just given some of the headwinds we've seen on the NGL and gas side of the equation?","Well, yes, Arun. Certainly, 2020 is -- feels a long way right now. I will tell you that we're putting a lot of energy, as I said in my remarks, on just planning our field effectiveness and smoothing out our full cadence. We talked about this in past quarters. We would be ready to go for sequential oil growth. Now that said, we haven't formed our 2020 plans. The commodity headwinds are certainly major factor. We're probably a little more bullish on oil as a contribution on our revenue, and you are not surprised to hear me say that, particularly with the environment we're seeing on gas and energy pricing. So although we haven't formed 2020 plans, I would say that to the extent of allocating capital, we're probably going to want to be emphasizing oil and then, although we'll be prepared for sequential growth, we have informed our 2020 plans and we'll make our decisions when more appropriate.","Great. Great. And just follow-up, maybe for Mark, but I was wondering if you can talk through your marketing arrangements of around your Permian crude. I know there's a new of West Texas light benchmark out there. So just wondering if you can give us some thoughts on health as the model you're Permian differentials on a go-forward basis?","Jeffrey Goldberger","Arun, this is Joe. Really, for the most part in Q2, to the extent that the beauty of those or high gravity was an impact on our pricing, we had already seen adjust of that in the -- during the second quarter. The index, as we're seeing it, the WTI of the next compared to May the push is now less than $1. We anticipate we'll have one of the contract fall under the WTL basis here by September. And when we look at the volume representation of that contributor relative to our total Permian oil price, I'm anticipating that, that might have anywhere, based on current strip, in the neighborhood of maybe a 30% to 35% overall hit on our total received oil price. So right now, the -- with basis of less than $1, we're getting a premium to that the beauty and the revised contract that we're looking at September. I don't know if that helps you out? ","And just an approximate mix of your primate upward, how much of that would be leveraged and maybe the beauty of posting new corporate versus WTI? That would be helpful.","Joseph Albi","Let's see if I can give you a ballpark here. First made me love the room. I'd say it's probably about 1\/3 to a 0.5 in the end. But again, a lot of that pricing is already in place.","Operator","You're next question is from Neil with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann","Tom, you mentioned about the consistent cadence. I'm just wondering how do you in the John and that I think about balancing that with the optimal size of a Delaware pass going forward?","Thomas Jorden","Well, those are really two related, but independent issues. The optimum size is kind of stands alone from cadence. We look at infrastructure requirements, we look at the amount of water handling at peak, we look at take away capacity, but first and foremost, we looking at the reservoir and what extent is the reservoir forgiving of add-ons and to what extent add-ons does introduce competitions in the parent-child issue. So we look at all of that. I will say this, if all else were equal and resourceful forgiving, we would probably go for smaller projects and then maybe 6 to 8 wells per project rather than these large projects and just for a whole host of region. But let me let John comment on that.","John Lambuth","Well, I think Tom hit the most part the relevant to that. I think most thing that controls are for us is the amount of infrastructure required when you bring on, both on both on the website of the gas side. And what we can to find in many of our areas that, Tom alluded to, is 6 to 8 well at the time is a pretty good cadence but also seems to fit well in terms of the pace of our infrastructure investment. If we were to go much beyond that, then, quite frankly, I think we'd be subject then to potential problems with getting consistent growth because there's a lot of moving parts out there. So right now, whether we looking in Culberson or Reeves or even up New Mexico, typically most of projects that were driven, the building projects or in that 6 to 8 well range right now.","A - Thomas Jorden ","Yes. But among the many factors we consider, we evaluate the economics of our assets throughout the asset life. So for the project and one of the considerations in determining size is when will we come back to add-on and what impact will that production have efficient development, both the impact of production we'll have on future development and what impact to the future development have 1 that production. And so we -- as you gain an understanding, area by area and reservoir by reservoir, that's important consideration to us. Some reservoirs are very forgiving. You can come back and they will have no impact. Some reservoirs are very unforgiving. It also involves understanding where you frac barriers are within your vertical section. And so, I just say again, it's not a one-size-fits-all. We'd like to make daily decisions around particular project.","Neal Dingmann","Great. Great. And just one follow up. You talked about capital expense specific. How do you arrive at the midpoint of CapEx of the year? It looks like you've already brought on about 60% of the wells and it was about 50% of the CapEx budgets, so if you could address that.","Joseph Albi","Yes. This is Joe. When you look at what we report, and what we're forecasting for CapEx, there's a lot of moving parts. We've got carry over dollars that were incurring '19 or '18 activity. You've got dollars that we're going to spend in '19 at a carry into 2020 activity. We've got infrastructure dollars, we've got soil water dollars and then on top of that, we've got the timing of activity relative to when dollars that ultimately recorded. In June, we completed and brought on line 13.1 net wells, 9.4 of those wells came on during the last two weeks. And as a result of that, we're anticipating that, that carry over is going to blow over in Q3 and then ultimately Crittenton our brains that we've given you guys.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Portillo with TPH.","Matthew Portillo","I was wondering if you might be able to elaborate a little bit on the completion design optimization and what may be driving some of those costs say that you highlighted at the meaning of the call?","Thomas Jorden","Well I take a stab at that. There's lots of knobs that one has to return on completion design. And certainly, spacing, states facing, cluster, types of cluster design, number of cluster per staged, amount of sand and fluid, pump rate, are your zipper fracking or not, I mean, all of those add up to the speed of efficiency in the field. But first and foremost, we focused on completion effectiveness, and we've done a lot of work on down whole effectiveness. We want to have a balance between cost effectiveness and completion and productivity effectiveness. And so we look at all of that and try to strike the right balance. I think we do an excellent job of it. We're always getting better and always questioning our core assumption, but I'll just finish and then let John comment. First and foremost, you have to understand your dumb reflecting geometry or you can make some really bad assumptions as it flows through the other decision.","Joseph Albi","Really to add on what Tom just said. We have been tweaking a few of our parameters. I'm not going to go into details of those parameters. What is nice to see is, over time, we starting to see the benefits of those weeks. We're starting to see little bit faster cadence with little bit of week. So we're seeing a nice cause-and-effect, and yet, with those minor tweaks, we're not, in any way, degrading the performance of the well. So it's kind of what we've always wanted to do that we like, in some cases, we have a pretty optimal design from a ERU well performance basis, and now we're making the smart weeks just an overall design that leads to a few more efficiencies. The jobs get done a little bit better and lower cost and we're not going to set up as the overall performance of the well. I think we're starting to see more and more with adjournment of the project that we're bringing on.","Thomas Jorden","And I guess I'd add on top of that, that on the design, the fluid times the amount of sand, et cetera, efficiency of execution out in the wilderness paramount. So quicker cleanouts, quicker stages, all that translate itself into an overall more efficient and cost-effective program.","Matthew Portillo","Great. And then a follow-up question around 2020. I know things are still in the works in terms of the planning profits there. But I was wondering if you could comment a bit, I guess, on just given where the strip is at the moment for gas and NGL prices, how you're thinking about capital allocation to the MidCon next year versus kind of how things should come this year in 2019? And then, Tom, I was wondering if you could flush out a little bit more of just some of the country you mentioned at the beginning of the call in terms of the potential for continuing to show sequential order growth quarter in an quarter out as you move into action? May be indications for -- from a high-level perspective kind of year-over-year growth on oil volumes into 2020? And I know things or kind of in the works, but just any incremental current might right there.","Mark Burford","Yes. I think a stab at both those. Although we haven't formed our 2020 plans, I would not anticipate our capital allocation significantly changing. Now We can argue about what significant means. We're in the process, in the Mid-Continent, of find and develop into a new plays and some new concept. We've talked in the past that we really like Anadarko Basin, and we'd like to find some new things there. And so that will probably be our dominant focus in the Anadarko Basin, which will really to a capital allocation that will, again, be disproportionately in favor of the Delaware Basin. And then in terms of the comments I made that you've asked me to follow up on, on sequential growth. I would say that as we look at into 2020, we certainly have the capacity for a meaningful oil growth and delivering that in a sequential fashion. But we have formed our 2020 plans. And there's going to be some soul-searching on what the macro environment is and what we've got to do with our capital. But we put a lot of work in the field efficiencies, we put a lot of work into organizational effectiveness and planning and we certainly have made tremendous progress, as we discussed in the past, on smoothing out a field operations and being able to deliver consistent quarterly execution. And we have that capacity, we have that ability, but we haven't yet formed the specifics of our 2020 plan.","Operator","You're next question is from Doug Leggett with Bank of America.","Douglas Leggate","Tom, no question that your execution excellence continues to do the -- exactly what you kind of over the years, focus on returns, focus on capital disciplines and so on. My question, I guess, is really more of a high-level philosophical question as to how do you position Cimarex today to compete with the broader market? Because clearly, what's happening in energy is putting pressure if. It does relate to investor appetite for exposure to the space. So what is the right growth great? How do you compete with the broad industrial sector? And how we think about potentially repositioning the company in this somewhat challenging time we're in right now?","Thomas Jorden","Well, those are great question, Doug. I think all of us have to ask question is what is the proper growth rate if at all? We sent you have the capacity to go but I think that we are asking for no other questions what's the growth rate that, we think, is appropriate? What amount of free cash can we and should be generated? And then what do you want to do with the free cash? I mean those are the similar questions right now. We are being challenged to behave like good man factors, and I'd say, at Cimarex, we accept that challenge. We've had to do a little bit of internal work that we talked about in terms of getting our field cadence more predictable, but than once we have that work done, which I believe we do, now it's beholding upon us to get to work and deliver consistent returns and there were those returns to shareholders. I'll say this, I think that, if we can open the word and let people look inside at some of the capital projects that we're executing, I think we would stand out for prudent investment decisions and generating returns that are showing us that the effort we've put into development learnings are paying off. But these are all good questions, we're wrestling with that. I think you'll see our 2020 plans reflecting that wrestling, and we accept the challenge. And, Mark, do you want to comment on that?","Mark Burford","Yes, Tom. That's definitely the items that we contemplate. And Doug, as we discussed in the past and future conference, the competitiveness of European countries text of up against industries and make it more attractive for the broader markets and generate free cash flow and some committed growth from, returning it to shareholders through different other measures, making our EMP business and our attractive and that something Cimarex will definitely focus on. We've focused on return on investment, making sure we're getting full cyclic returns and taking the next step how we can further make our stock and our demonstrate should that return to shareholders. ","Thomas Jorden","You know, I'm going to finish, Doug, by saying philosophical, I'm going to take you up on that. We're all very short-term and in our thinking. And we subject to it, markets are subject to it, we always that current conditions are the new normal and will be permanent condition. We're in a cyclic business. We've seen lots of cycles, and so we remain focused on the long-term, on developing and executing a business that's sustainable, that can withstand the cycles and commodity. We remain cognizant of the fact that 1 or 2 world events could change this conversation materially. We're confident that the world needs the products we produce for decades to come. And finally, the things we're being asked to do, show capital discipline, show that we can grow modestly and free cash flow, demonstrate to the extent markets that we're prudence stewards of capital and making investments that are efficient and effective. Those are good things to do regardless of changes in the macro environment. So we're going to get after, and we're going to the mission that we can adapt. But we're also want to remind ourselves that we're in the business for the long-term, and the things we see and feel today may not be around forever. That's certainly been our experience. So we're here for the long haul.","Douglas Leggate","I appreciate you answering the question, Tom. you're certainly right in answering the question I agree with you on that. If I may, just a quick operation follow up. There's a lot of moving parts on infrastructure, obviously, going on in the second half of the year, going into 2020. So I just wondered if you can kind of sum up the prognosis for you guys as it reached to gas and NGL with prognosis, if you like, for how you see your differentials evolving? I realized there was some funny on your gas realizations this quarter, but any help from 20 see that moving into the next year and I'll leave it there.","Thomas Jorden","Doug, looking at the -- starting at the second half of '19, looking at Waha and the gas price index, we're looking at index, we're looking around [indiscernible] Q3 going into $1.50 in the future serve, for Q4. They're averaging little bit over $1.20 or so for the second half of the year. So we see that improving into the second half of the year with Gulf Coast Express coming on. Future spark is reflecting that, and we expect our second half naturalization to improve. And then you mentioned some of the reported realized price relative to accounting ASC 606, which has an processing costs against it, which, in Q2, there was $0.40 in Mcf, a processing and translation cost against the realized price that will continue. Sino in order to model the full price and to corporate the differential for 66 a surprise, so we get the amount for the impact in the press release and payable.","Douglas Leggate","There's a transfer of said, though, on that?","Mark Burford","That's right, Doug. There's a transfer of said. That's exactly right. I mean going into 2020, we see a forward curve that oscillates a fair amount into 2020. Our first year, our first orders hires $1.70, going to $0.80 in the second, but either premium prices or going to $1.30 to $1.40, similar type improvements or realization compared to what we've seen in the second quarter this year.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Couple of follow-ups that I wanted to ask earlier. First come on the midterm. You talked about concepts that you'd be working on that you are working on. Can you just talk to where those stand? And what you would need to see to allocate more capital there in 2020?","Thomas Jorden","Well, I don't want to comment on any particular place or the evolution of them. We talk about it and what we have resulted talk about in the second one is easy. When we need to see a material returns that compete with the Delaware Basin. Certainly, a lot of what we have in the Mid-Continent today can be, they capital allocating as it Mid-Continent because it heads up what you seeing with Delaware. But the robust inventory there is not the same. we have a deep inventory of those things from the Delaware that compete for talk to the capital that we do in an adorable. And so what would need to see his deep inventory and some great returns of new and emerging plays.","Brian Singer","And would you allocate rigs back on a normal -- just among the base legacy place relative to current levels?","Thomas Jorden","Brian, I would send rigs to the moon if you would make good profits doing so. we're here to make money and we -- that's our only bias to make money and be able to make money through the commodity cycle. So absolutely, we would relocate capital if he thought it was in the best interest of our shareholders.","Brian Singer","And then my follow-up is, you've touched on this a bit earlier, but maybe it's part of your soul searching process for 2020. It sounds like you're trying to find that precise optimal point of growth [indiscernible] a corporate level doesn't free cash flow, but any of calculus with exhibit and particularly importance of free cash flow as you think about that 2020 plan versus asset or corporate-level returns?","Thomas Jorden","Well, yes, I do know that we're doing a deeper, broader sole searching than anybody else. I think we're all asking the question of clearly growing a maximum capacity is not what -- we're not getting market signals, but that's what people want, and we're listening long and clear. We also deeply cognizant of the fundamentals demand and that we certainly have some market bottleneck. So we're -- I'll say this, many of us -- through the industry, not just talking by some expert many of this group in a world where we grew the national rate we could sustain. And clearly today, that's not what we need to do. And so it's a tension between our do you want to read all? And if so, doing and making a decision, if you throw up -- your growth back, you may generate free cash flow and then what you do with it. I mean I'm just repeating myself, but I think anybody in the EMP sector that's paying attention is asking the same question. And we'll all have different answers based on our portfolio, our balance sheet and our assets.","Operator","You're next question is from next [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","My question is long going on capital allocation. I think it was a year ago on your call. Discussions a lot of discussion about whether the company would initiate a buy back. And I think I recall it, you look into it, talked to the board and at that point in time, you guys decide not to do one. Fast-forward today, this talking about half of it was than [indiscernible] all prices are down little bit, but I'm just wondering, especially as you alluded to, what would you do with the free cash flow if you went into a no-growth state? Why does no discussion currently, at least to us, about a buyback? The stock is down tremendously, the NAV, by anybody's measure, is much higher than the current stock price. With liquidity and a stock trading where it is, can you give us an update on your talk as to what management is thinking?","Thomas Jorden","Well, certainly, your points are well taken and the argument for buyback is more persuasive today than it was a year ago or 2 years ago. But we will announce any decisions that we make once we make them. I mean we always looking at it and it's a question of how much free cash do you have, and is that where do you want to deploy it. We really not a team that likes to get drawn into spec condition. You made good and acknowledge them and we certainly think that our share price is at the point where an analysis of that in the past is outdated. Mark, do you want to follow on that?","Mark Burford","Yes. I think that's containing evaluating. I think it's buyback in an itself looking at the relation to stock relative to the investment is something we've always taken into account. And right now, with the stock price, which is, and so we have to continue to be validated. And I think it's if you had free cash flow at this point, we're still kind of neutral at this point. But as you look forward into our experience, we expect to free cash flow. And I think we're going to be looking at that time between what we think the stock relation is this compared to the other investments. And this would be the point in time. If we had free cash flow right now, and cash in the balance sheet, we definitely, I think, realizing that.","Unidentified Analyst","I just leave it with, I think, pretty strong on investors that the company recognizes the value of it's own stock especially given the long reserve that we have and the significant discount you have on the valuation.","Thomas Jorden","We agree with that and appreciate your comment.","Operator","The next question is from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.","Jeanine Wai","My first question is on efficiency. So far this year, you completed more wells and anticipated due to better efficiencies. Can you quantify some of these deficiencies in terms of drilling or completion days? And commented on how sustainable you think you guys or going forward? I know you discussed in your prepared remarks the end result, which is your cost, but just looking for a little bit more detail?","Mark Burford","Yes, Janine. The efficiencies that we really, that are, I guess, are evident in the arrests that show up as a night in Q2 versus Q3, they are really about 2 to 3 weeks' worth of benefit that we saw from an were able to turn on, turn both online and start to see first production. So when we put our models together, we, obviously, using charts, et cetera, trying to line up everything including relapse and what have you, we've just seen, over the last quarter, just some very good efficiencies out in the field without any hiccups. We've also seen these wells ready for production when we were done drilling our plugs with facilities and mines and they started cutting hydrocarbon earlier than we had forecasted that is well. So we built a little bit of cushion into our forward-looking guidance and those restaurants beat it.","Jeanine Wai","Okay. And then my follow-up call is kind of following up on the couple of the other questions. Regarding those 10 extra net wells that we did in plan, can you talk about the process of eliminating those 12 wells in the back half of the year? It sounds like to make up for it in the schedule. Can you discuss the process for that in terms of maintaining the operational consistency that you talked about? It sounds like the quarterly timing shift might not be that big of a deal because of hardly in the extra well were. And the way we see it, you've got it. Lot of debts at the end of the year for of snidely heading into 2020, if you choose. And then maybe in an popular question, but is there a scenario where you would just considered to keep going and pulling forward some of the 2020 wells into the because it's the best thing to do operationally. So perhaps short-term paying for medium-term benefit. And we mentioned him asserting that you can adapt to the current environment, but also that the market is a bit short-term focus right now.","Thomas Jorden","Well, when you dissect a plan, what we really thought, just some small accelerations of wells coming online from Q3 into Q2, and I've talked weeks on that, not like way a month in advance. And some of the Q4 wells getting pulled earlier in the Q4 and\/or even maybe the tail end of Q3. The end result as far, as this year is concerned, we're pretty darn right on top of what we thought we might do from a technical standpoint. And looking at about the same amount of decks at the end of the year. And then as far as trying to do anything in acceleration for over '20 and '19, we're going to be very, very cognizant of our capital and how much money we're spending in '19.","Operator","The next question is from Mike's Kaplowitz Chief Financial Officer.","Michael Scialla","Just wondering now that you've transfer agreement for natural gas, if you revisited your thoughts on transfer for oil at all?","Thomas Jorden","Yes, we actually have. We've been looking at and have entered into an agreement for take way to the Gulf Coast out of the Mid-Continent, which also gives us an off-road into a from the Permian. And about 10,000 barrels a day commitment, expandable up to 20,000 and it begins at first quarter of 2021. So it's going to give us the ability to get up to the Gulf Coast, Houston ship Channel with our oil and thinking that oil either out of the Mid-Continent or the West Texas area. When you look at the speck of what we're doing, it's not only on oil side. We've particular long-term arrangement for May kind of gas question year. And then in the Permian, we've gone ahead and got some fair amount of West Texas into Waha and then, with us getting into the reserve project, add up to 125 million a day. We're looking at all the means to get out of the basin that we can, and at the same time, we've locked up all of our gas sales for all of our residue gas through majority of the 2020. And it's really insurance flow and trying to get to the better markets.","Michael Scialla","You think you're done in that regard at this point? Or is that more so to go there?","Mark Burford","Do not really speaking. So we've taken some steps above and beyond where we've been, and we're going to continue to take additional steps going forward.","Michael Scialla","Good. Okay. And just wanted us ask, from an operational standpoint, last quarter, you talked about -- and you mentioned in the slide deck, the Sir Barton and have Brokers Tip pads. Just wondering what the end result was there? I now you were testing X and Y Sands and some spacing. What did you learn there?","Thomas Jorden","Yes. Both of those pads, Sir Barton Brokers Tip, those were 7 wells each that we brought on. They were indeed testing as part of the development, different landing zones with some of them being pushed up into what we call the Y sand instead over our regular in landing zone. Both projects are very economic for us. We're very pleased with them, but there's been some important learnings. We're definitely seeing that if we can get those landings further up and get a little bit more vertical separation with the lower tier landings, we definitely like the results of those wells versus when they're a little bit more crowded on a vertical basis. And so that's something we're incorporating, in fact, have incorporated into the next open project on the west side of commerce, which is carryback. Also, I'd just say, from a cost standpoint, and you alluded to this, we're very pleased, especially in the Western side of Culberson that what we're seeing so far on a cost basis and have adjusted this is specifically just these two projects, but so far, we're seeing about $1,000 per foot cost on that development project combined for both of those, which is a very, very good number and something that we expect going forward, especially in the personal side, where it's a little bit shallower, a little bit lower pressure and thus, much quicker drilling for us.","Operator","The next question is from Jeffrey Campbell with 3 Brothers Investment.","Jeffrey Campbell","I'll my question to one of the two-part. We've been talking some about that the new place that we're trying to stay down in the MidCon. And first question I want to ask us, can any of these efforts take place on existing acreage? And the second one is, if there is some success here, would this increase any provision for M&A? Or is this going to be an entirely organic effort?","Thomas Jorden","Well, certainly, yes. We have a very large increase footprint in Anadarko, and I have high executions that are among the footprint, yes, there will be opportunities of other landings zones other intervals that might lead to a much better returns to them say, why were originally listed, which was. A lot of acreage us acquire and drilled at time where natural gas prices were much higher, so that essentially establish that footprint for us. And as you said in the past, all that acreage is held by production. So we had the luxury of digging in, understanding the overall column and then, as Tom alluded, looking for those intervals or clearly have the kind of hydrocarbon mix, which, in this case, means oil that the right time of drilling complete cost would be to returns that could be competitive with our Permian program. As far as could this lead to M&A? I don't know. I mean, obviously, that's an option but first and foremost, we have to herself be convinced that: a, we have found a zone that for capital on ongoing basis, which means there must be cited, it must be sustainable. And in that scenario, then, yes, I think we would then see what other opportunities might be out there that could complement that, that's above and beyond our existing acreage footprint.","Jeffrey Campbell","Appreciate the color, and we will see you in New York on Thursday.","Operator","Next question is from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall","I just wanted to talk about capital a little bit. If you look at your year-to-date oil volumes and then into third quarter guide, kind of indicate the fourth quarter oil midpoint around 89 MBOE per day, which was basically flat to maybe relative to 4Q '18 pro forma for the Resolute deal. Is that a fair way to think about? Then if we look at the 2019 capital, is it fair to think about 2019 capital is basically kind of a maintenance level for your oil volumes at this point? Or it's kind of transfer of factors that may suggest that the inappropriate way of looking at that capital efficiency at this point?","Thomas Jorden","Yes, Michael, there's a lot of ways to look at capital efficiency. And if you look at the capital that the pro forma capital along with pro forma both ramping significantly to the fourth quarter, both had a very high exit rate in the fourth quarter accomplishes that year. That definitely has a overpay is how we look to lose the fourth quarter to fourth quarter rates. And the maintenance capital with Resolute and some I'm trying to maintain a flat fourth quarter fourth quarter. I guess, we're -- our capital on a pro forma basis is down year-over-year as abundance of capital and cash into 2019. So I guess, going to argue that with adjustments in a capital, by holding our capital -- our production roughly flat, I would see on that.","Yes. I just want to remind you that Resolute was on a pretty massive outspend and as we pulled with an asset and we certainly face the commodity environment a number of certain we anticipated, we made the decision to bring the combined entity forward within cash flow. But I also want to say, we're very, very pleased with those assets. And we haven't talked a lot about operational detail in this call but I would share with you that, we are currently flowing back at Sandlot project, which was essentially an extension of a development project that Resolute had been 2 phases. On our extension, we incorporated some of the earnings that we brought, and as we flow some of those wells back, we have performance our revenue wells that had been the average of the project on the pain. We're seeing high oil recovery, but their plans and so we really like those assets and we sing fruits of all the reasons why we wanted them in our hand.","Michael Hall","Okay. And I guess there is a follow-up. As you think about the completion count, at the end of the year, relative to expectations around exit, recounting 2 counts, how does that look relative to normal? And what sort of timeframe -- if that's above normal, what sort of timeframe would you suggest is to think about that normalizing back down? Just trying to think more predictable efficiency.","Joseph Albi","I'm not certain what you're alluding to. Are you talking about the number of, let's say, frac plays that we're running right now, versus beginning of the year?","Michael Hall","No. Just wanted a completion count that you provided for year-end 2019. If you look at that relative to expectations of rig and completion crew's at the end of the year, how does that compare to normal? And should we...?","Mark Burford","A normal level, but we have gone from two factors to two, there's some bearing on that. At the year-end '18, we had 20 or network that we kind of waiting on first production. That has increased and, obviously, 42 [indiscernible] waiting production at the end of '19. But it is up a little bit but it is sufficiently from 3 crews to 2 crews. As we going to '20, and we expect that back to 3. And it's one of our bigger timing of the projects we're developing and the size of the different projects. That's the biggest book offering.","Thomas Jorden","I think those nine net wells kind of slipped a couple of weeks in Q2 are really playing a role in how I guess we are being perceived out there. But last quarter's guidance, for the rest of the year, we're projecting 34 net wells for the last half of the year, and right now, we're now at 27. So all this happened is a few wells slid into Q2 right at the very end of Q2.","Michael Hall","Okay. And I just think about I was trying to think about what 2020 -- potential tailwinds 2020 capital efficiency from that backlog reflected on completion wells. It doesn't really sound like that's particularly out of normal, particularly if you're going to begin up the completion crew up there?","Thomas Jorden","No. Indeed, The docs are virtually about the same effect a little bit more on a going forward. So again, it's just a some slight moving of a couple net wells is all that's really going on.","Operator","The next question is from Mark with Seaport Global.","Michael Kelly","I'm a big fan of the Slide 13, which highlights year or productivity, Culberson relative to other counties in Delaware. With this in mind, I was hoping to have you guys may be, what we can expect at the Reeves County acreage in terms of our productivity, and ultimately, the returns versus kind of [indiscernible] Culberson acreage, acknowledging that range is a massive to and figures hopefully would be more sweet spot. But just wanted to get your thoughts there.","Mark Burford","We're not yes. When you look at the site and I'm a big fan of the upside as well, that it certainly highlights, in a very significant rate, the performance of Culberson, which basically, when you see Culberson, that's Cimarex. I mean that's pretty much comprised those well. Whereas what we've done is of course going to the state that the end amalgamated or the 2-mile lateral from all the operators into making that craft. And without a doubt, as you said, Reeves is a very big county. And as you can see, on that particular graph, Reeves tends to fall after 18 months to lower end. I can tell you that we've looked at that graph separately just with Cimarex wells, and yes, we definitely separate themselves from with that background trend shows. And yes, we feel very good that the acreage that we have and have recently acquired through Resolute is some of the rhetoric, which in Reeves County that does need to better commutative production and what you see is the average there for the entire county.","Matthew Portillo","And can't help to notice you got this next line of said in the water infrastructure. And just wanted to get your men high-level thoughts on what you think is a good value then we could potentially peg in that event system? And if there's any kind of updated thoughts on your desire to monetize that?","Thomas Jorden","Well, value is [indiscernible] water is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the Permian Basin business. We're always obsessing that, and I've talked in the past, and I'll say again, that there may, indeed be a point in time, we're monetizing some of our midstream assets make sense to us. Right now, I'd say the value we get out of it is the operating cost, access to water for recycling and a really good environmental footprint with the way we've designed the water infrastructure. With these monetization needs, it ultimately becomes a tradeoff of CapEx of OpEx. I mean certainly, we're invested capital in that system. If you were to select, if you would have a higher operating cost through a fee structure. But we keep that analysis Evergreen, we look at it as a business and there may, indeed, be an appropriate time where we'll decide to monetize it. But right now, the biggest benefit for -- from us, is operational efficiency, low operating cost and it's really helping us also have capital savings in water recycling. So it's a great asset. Our team has really done a accretive job in building it. It's something we're very proud of, both from just an operating efficiency, but from an informative footprint. And monetizing it is not off the table, but I'll just say this, we look at it constantly and when we think it makes sense, we'll move forward.","Mark Burford","To elaborate a little bit further to Tom's point, just the recycling alone is potentially saving is anywhere from $350,000 to $550,000 per well from an development cost and point. So many months rather by the number of wells, potentially, the Culberson, we're talking a fair amount of capital reduction by virtue of owning it.","Operator","The last question is from blanker with Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","You're thoughts about shifting to be consistent activity pace and can you just talk about kind of what that looks like? And where the right level of activities assuming that the cashless fully funded rig count or fax parents. Some more high-level way to qualify that measure?","Thomas Jorden","Well, yes. We're currently running rings in the Permian, and I think that's a reasonable cadence as much forward. Of course, this also involves what we decided to do in 2020. I'd say that the biggest decision we make is how many frac to deploy, and that's often the particular project that we have and can we keep 3 frac crews continuously deployed and be efficient in doing that. Well what we don't want to do is bring a third when and release the third 2, bring the third row in and release the third crew. One of the things that again, we talked about this on prior calls, we are in an area where 2\/3 or more of our well cost is on the completion of facility site and that means that as we plan our field events that the drilling rig itself no longer needs the demand and control total project timing. So we're looking at smoothing out that completion facilities capital to bring things on in a more consistent pace, distribute the fieldwork so it's not peak demand slowdown, peak demand slowdown. And we're learning a lot and how to manage these projects. We're getting a lot better, and I'm not particularly answering your question on what the right activity level is. It will really be a function of what we decide to do as we look into 2020. But I'll say, our organization has gotten tremendously better at just project management and understanding how to eliminate these peaks and valleys in activity.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for that color, tom. I guess 1 follow-up on that. You guys have made a lot of progress on reducing well cost. Is there much room for additional more cost reductions? And how would that more consistent activity cadenced will play into that?","Thomas Jorden","I would answer that, that will always looking for will cost reduction. So the 5% to 6% reduction that we saw in completion costs just from April really were due to the focus of design and operational efficiencies. And we're looking at a plethora of data that we've been able to obtain over the years that we've been completing these wells and trying to optimize these ingredients to the frac and see the potential to continue to find ways to reduce our well cost. So don't want to possible because I don't know that it is what I do know that this is out there that since we can give more efficient and we can potentially produce our net asset value well maybe that may not have as happy great, but certainly, from a capital investments standpoint, providing better economic. So we're looking at everything.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

All participants will be in listen-only mode.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Karen Acierno, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Acierno, please go ahead.","Karen Acierno - Director of Investor Relations","Thanks, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call this morning. So, yesterday afternoon, an updated presentation was posted to our website. We will be referring to this presentation during our call today. And as a remainder our discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business.","So today's prepared remarks will begin with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling activities and results from John Lambuth, our VP of Exploration. And then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on our operations, including production and well costs. Our CFO Mark Burford is also present to help answer any questions.","And as Rocco said, we want to try and keep everybody to one question and one follow-up, so that we can get everybody in the question queue and you can feel free to jump back in if you have another question.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Karen. And thanks to everyone who's participating in today's conference call. We sincerely appreciate your interest and look forward to your questions during the question-and-answer portion of the call.","On the call today, John will walk us through our recent results and describe our progress on some of the delineation projects that we have underway. Joe will follow John with an operational overview including some of the significant steps we have taken to improve field efficiencies. As we've described in the past calls, owning to the timing of our delineation projects, many of the significant results from our 2016 delineation program will come and fits and starts this year.","Rest assured our organization is hard at work during this downturn: necessity is the mother of invention. I'd like to open the call with some brief overview remarks regarding our direction in 2016 and beyond. As always our focus will be on results. We reported a strong production beat this quarter driven by improved well performance.","Our total company production came in at 973 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the first quarter, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Expenses came in within guidance, resulting in the strong quarter overall. Gas production was up, our oil production was down slightly. As we had forecasted this was due to fewer well completions in the Permian Basin, due to the timing of our delineation projects.","We expect to pick up the pace on our Permian completions during the remainder of the year. We also reported a modest increase in our 2016 capital budget. This is the result of the completions of our East Cana-Woodford infill program being pushed forward from 2017 into 2016. The application of bigger, more effective stimulations across the board and greater than anticipated working interest in both our own wells and in partner operated wells.","With the results that we're seeing we're delighted to have the increased exposure. Since our last call, we've seen a bit of breathing room in commodity prices, as a result, we're accelerating some of the Permian completion activity that was delayed due to the plant outages this winter.","As you'll also hear during the call, our focus on science and innovation continues apace. We continue to experiment with more effective stimulations, primarily to the use of more profit, more stages, tighter cluster spacing and more clusters per stage and the use of diverter technology.","This down cycle and associated decrease in activity is providing an ideal environment to focus on science and technology. We're also taking advantage of decreased service cost to experiment and improve our methodologies. We've also made great strides in reducing our cost structure. The organization is undergoing a concerted effort to lower G&A through voluntary retirements that lead to head count reductions, reducing contract and consultant services and optimizing work efficiencies, particularly in the field.","Finally, before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to comment on our thoughts as we look ahead.","In 2015, we said that our challenge was to get our program to a point where it was sustainable, where we were living within cash flow and had a capital program and a cost structure that was appropriate for the new normal. In our last call, we told you that our challenge in 2016 was to preserve our assets, preserve our balance sheet and preserve our organization. I am pleased to tell you that we're on track with both sets of goals.","As we look ahead of the current strip, we modeled at Cimarex that lives within cash flow and is able to get back on a growth trajectory in the years ahead. We have best-in-class assets and we will be able to preserve our prime leasehold with our current program. Our organization is effective, focused and hard at work, generating new opportunities. Our balance sheet provides the flexibility and strength that will keep Cimarex at the forefront in a highly competitive landscape.","We don't know where commodity prices are headed, but we don't expect to return to the price levels of 2014 anytime soon. Margins will be challenged, cost structures will be paramount, and asset quality, and organizational effectiveness will be the differentiator. It's always been a tough business, and things won't be any easier as we move ahead. Our focus is on performance and results. Although further price recovery would be warmly welcomed, we are in great shape, and look ahead with conviction that our value creation proposition is alive and well.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John to provide further color on our program.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter, before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results, and more color on our 2016 plans. Cimarex invested $158 million on the exploration and development during the first quarter, about 55% was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going towards activities in Mid-Continent region.","Companywide, we've brought 22 gross, five net wells on production during the quarter. Despite the small number of wells completed during the quarter, Cimarex had an average of 10 operated rigs running during the quarter. These rigs were busy finishing the drilling of infill wells, and the Woodford shale, as well as drilling spacing pilots in both the Delaware Basin, and the Mid-Continent.","That activity is winding down, and a majority of our contracted drilling rigs will be rolling off by July. By August, we plan to be down to three operated rigs. In the Delaware Basin, you may recall that we spud a down spacing pilot in the upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County in the fourth quarter of 2015.","We are finished with the drilling portion of these wells, and completions are scheduled to begin in mid May. First production is now expected by midyear. This six well, 7,500-foot lateral pilot will test two different spacing designs. One at eight wells per section, while the other will test six wells per section, both will be drilled in a staggered pattern. Cimarex continues to push the envelope on well completions.","On page 12 of our presentation, we've shown you the uplift, using a 40% larger completion on these Upper Wolfcamp wells, which equates to 1,640 pounds of sand per foot.","We are about to take that a step further on using even larger design to complete this six well pilot. Incorporating 2,500 pounds of sand per lateral foot, these pilot wells will have 44% more sand pump, than the largest completed wells we've had to date, as shown on page 12. We are currently drilling also, our Lower Wolfcamp infill project, which we call Tim Tam. This 10,000 foot spacing pilot is comprised of five wells, which will be drilled in a stacked\/staggered pattern testing six wells per section. We believe, the success we've had with larger completions in the upper Wolfcamp should easily translate to the Lower Wolfcamp.","If I wave an example, page 13 in our presentation illustrates the uplift we've seen with a larger completion on a 10,000 foot Upper Wolfcamp well. We have also just finished operations on our largest Lower Wolfcamp completion to date, a well we call the Flying Ebony, where we pumped 2,400 pounds of sand per foot.","The production data from this well, along with the larger completions we're doing in the Upper Wolfcamp, will provide us critical data for the design of future completions, including the Tim Tam wells, which are scheduled to be completed in the second half of 2016.","For the remainder of 2016, the vast majority of the capital that we will spend in the Permian will be earmarked for acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. The total capital ascribed to acreage holding in the Delaware Basin is just over $200 million in 2016. Part of this obligation drilling will include six two mile long infill wells in Reeves County, which recently commenced drilling. Similar to our Anaconda pilot, these wells will be drilled using a stacked\/staggered pattern resulting in equivalent of 12 wells per section. Once drilling is completed on this section, we will be down to two operated rigs in the Permian for the remainder of the year.","Now on to the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford development project on the east side of the Cana core in the fourth quarter 2015. This development covers six sections of which Cimarex operates two sections.","Due to some last minute changes in working interest, this infill project now consists of 47 gross, 22 net wells. Drilling is nearly finished and completion of these wells have been moved up. It is now scheduled for early October versus the first quarter 2017. This change in scheduling was a contributing factor in our $50 million increase in capital expenditures for 2016.","And our emerging Meramec play, we now have production data on 18 operated 5,000 foot laterals. Also, our third 10,000 foot lateral in the Meramec has been on production since early January. Located in Blaine county, this well called the Dakota Carol 1H-2722X had a 30-day peak IP rate of 10.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day including 951 barrels of oil per day. That results in a condensate yield of around 278 barrels per million.","Page 21 of the presentation illustrates the average uplift, we've seen from the three long laterals in the Meramec versus the 5,000 foot laterals drilled to date. They have outperformed the shorter laterals by 62% within \u2013 by 120 days. While we are very encouraged by the initial uplift in IP that we're seeing in these 10,000-foot laterals, we continue to carefully monitor the decline profile in order to determine the ultimate EURs for these long laterals.","To better understand the multi-zone potential for this area, we have designed a downspacing pilot which commenced drilling in the fourth quarter 2015 and has just finished the drilling phase. See slide 22 for an illustration of the design. The eight new wells will be stacked and staggered in both the Meramec and Woodford formations. The spacing in the Meramec will be the equivalent of 10 wells per section made up of five upper and five lower staggered Meramec wells. The Woodford will be drilled with our standard nine wells per section development plan.","Another Meramec spacing pilot operated by our partner Devon, was recently completed, and is in the early stages of flow-back. The results from this five wells per section pilot will strongly influence our completion plans for the stacked\/staggered pilot. Once drilling is finished on the infill sections, we'll be focused on holding our Meramec acreage.","As you know, in late 2014 we added 12,250 net acres in the Meramec at an average cost of $1,650 per acre. About $70 million of our capital would be invested in holding Meramec acreage in 2016. We currently have four rigs operating in the Mid-Continent region with plans to be down to one operated rig by July of this year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","Well, thank you, John. And thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll hit on the usual items, our first quarter production, our Q2 and full-year 2016 production outlook. And then I'll follow-up with a few comments on LOE and service cost.","As Tom mentioned with the help of stronger than expected base property and new well performance, our first quarter volumes, came in slightly better than anticipated. Our reported total company net equivalent production of 973 million a day, beat our guidance projection of 925 million to 955 million a day and was up 3% from the 947 million a day that we posted in Q1 2015. As expected, facility disruptions and processing constraints in the Permian did negatively impact our Q1 production to the tune of approximately 30 million a day.","Our first quarter equivalent Permian production came in at 477 million a day, down 43 million a day from Q4 2015. The decrease was expected and came as primarily a result of the facility downtime I just mentioned, as well as completing three net Permian wells in Q1 as compared to eight wells in the fourth quarter of 2015. With our Cana row four wells coming online in late Q4, we did anticipate a nice Mid-Continent posting during Q1 and we saw just that. With the wells exceeding our planned expectations, our Mid-Continent volumes came in at 493 million a day. That's up 7% from the 461 million a day we reported in the fourth quarter and 11% from the 444 million a day that we posted a year ago in Q1 2015.","As we look forward into the remainder of this year, we've made a few changes to our completion schedule, including the addition of a frac crew in the Permian to help catch up on deferred completions from the downstream disruptions in Q1. And by advancing, as John mentioned, the timing of our Cana (15:47) completions to October of this year.","With our stronger than expected Q1 results, and these completion timing adjustments, we've increased our full year total company equivalent production guidance to 940 million to 970 million a day, up about, at a midpoint basis, 45 million a day from our beginning year guidance of 890 million to 930 million.","As compared to our original guidance, the acceleration of our Cana infill project, results in a significant decrease in the number of drilled but uncompleted wells on our books at the end of the year. Our current model now projects 32 gross and 9 net Mid-Continent wells waiting on completion at year-end; that compares to the 57 gross and 24 net wells that we anticipated we'd have awaiting completion earlier this year, when we issued our beginning year guidance. The acceleration not only boosts our 2016 total company guidance, but it increases our projected 2016 exit rate as well. With our new modeling, we now project our total company fourth quarter exit rate this year to be right in line with that of the 986 million a day that we posted back in the fourth quarter of 2015.","In the Permian, the Q1 facility downtime and processing constraints resulted in us deferring approximately three net completions into the latter part of this year. With the processing constraints anticipated to now be behind us, our plans are to add a second completion crew to help catch up \u2013 that'll be here in May and into early June. And with the projected two rigs working the latter part of the year, as John mentioned, we're still forecasting approximately 50 gross and 30 net Permian wells to come online in 2016.","That's flat with our previous estimates, but we've just really accelerated the pace here into Q2 and Q3. So as a result, our projected number of Permian drilled and uncompleted wells will in essence drop fairly quickly here from 34 gross and 21 net wells here in May to 10 gross and 9 net on the books by year-end.","For Q2 2016, our projected guidance of $935 million to $965 million a day, reflects a drop in production from Q1 2016 levels, primarily as we await the scheduled Permian and Cana completion activity which is planned for Q3 and Q4. And to help provide you with some clarity on our projected completion timing through the year. We completed five net wells in Q1, we're forecasting approximately 13 net wells to be completed in Q2 with approximately 44 net wells projected to come on line in Q3 and Q4. So you can see the emphasis in the later quarters as far as our completion activity is concerned.","Shifting gears to OpEx, our production group continue to make great strides during Q1 to further reduce our operating cost. Through their efforts, we realized additional and sizable cost reductions in items such as salt water disposal, compression, rentals and contract labor. As a result, our Q1 2016 lifting cost came in at $0.80 per Mcfe. That was at the low end of our guidance which was $0.80 to $0.90 per Mcfe, down 6.3% from our fourth quarter average of $0.85 and down 17% from the $0.96 we posted for the average in the first quarter of 2015.","With our cost control efforts, we're projecting our 2016 lifting cost to continue to fall in the range of $0.80 to $0.90. I'd say we'll most likely be on the lower end of that range as we finish out the year. We're extremely proud of the efforts that our ops team has put forward to reduce our cost structure, all the while maintaining safe and efficient operations.","Tom touched on this, not only is doing so so critical for us to be able to compete in this low product price environment, but our reduced OpEx is also freeing up capital for our drilling program, making us a more efficient operator. Since prices began falling back in 2014, on an absolute basis we've seen our total company monthly net operating expense drop about $5 million per month, which annualized equates to an additional $60 million that we can direct to our drilling program.","And finally, a few comments on drilling and completion cost. Although most drilling cost components remained somewhat in check during Q1, we were able to realize some modest reductions in service costs on the completion side, primarily in the Permian. On the drilling side, we're keeping our focus on efficiencies as seen with our Q1 average Wolfcamp spud-to-rig release drill time, now down to 28 days as compared to 35 days in 2014.","On the completion side; in addition to the modest service cost reductions I mentioned, mostly in the Permian, we placed a strong emphasis on reducing our water sourcing cost by challenging our team in the planning, engineering and operating efficiencies in that regard. The results of our efforts are just now beginning to make their way into our total well cost. As we continue to push the limit on our frac design and size, our completion costs will continue to dominate our total well cost, while we experiment with larger frac designs, many of our generic well AFEs still have stayed somewhat in check.","An exception is the Wolfcamp, where both our drilling and completion efficiencies have reduced our generic two-mile lateral Culberson lower Wolfcamp AFE to a range of $10.2 million to $11.2 million. That's down 5% from the $10.8 million to $11.6 million range that we quoted last call and down 22% from where we were in late 2014.","With last quarter's frac designs, our Cana core one-mile lateral wells, continue to run in a range of $6.6 million to $7 million, unchanged from the last call and down 16% to 17% from 2014, but with the larger frac designs that we're contemplating to be utilized here in Q3 2016, this range is likely to increase anywhere in a range of $500,000 to $600,000 per well.","And in the Meramec, our current one-mile lateral AFE still in the range of $7 million to $7.4 million. Again that is unchanged from last call and down 13% from late 2014 and also here, if we employ larger fracs moving forward, we could see an additional $500,000 to $600,000 in these AFE as well.","So in closing, we had another great quarter, we beat guidance, despite sizable downstream and weather disruptions. We've made significant strides further reducing our LOE, our drilling and completion group remains focused on cost efficiencies \u2013 reductions and efficiencies, and optimizing the results of our fracs and our teams are tightly focused on maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells all the while we're optimizing our investment program results.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Pearce Hammond of Simmons\/Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Good morning, and great quarter, guys. My first question is on slide 11, on the Culberson County Wolfcamp 10,000 foot laterals, the before tax IRR changed \u2013 moved higher significantly since your last update on this particular slide. I was just curious what was driving that significant change?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. This is John. There are several factors in there, the biggest driver is just an improvement in our type curve or expectation going forward. And that's really related to the \u2013 continually to increase our frac design on these wells. We have three wells now with this current design which I talked about earlier at the 1,640 pounds per foot and those wells have been long enough now that, what's really impressing us is quite frankly lack of decline.","These wells come on and they tend to have a very long flat period to them. And we have enough time with those now that we've gained confidence in that type curve and that's led to a major change in our expectation for these wells going forward. I should also point out, though, as Joe mentioned, we actually have also in addition to that, seen some cost reduction in those wells.","So, with all that, factored together, that's led to the improvement you're seeing there.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Excellent. Thank you for that color. And then my follow up and this grows out of slide number 20 in your presentation on the Meramec. But looks like you had some do well results there on the 5,000 foot lateral and then also the 10,000 foot lateral, looks like they were slightly weaker than some prior ones. Now, they may have had a bit of a higher oil cut. Just want to get some color on those recent well results in the Meramec.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John, again. Well, first thing I would say is, this is still an emerging play and for us, we're still out there doing both a combination of holding acreage, delineating acreage and testing frac design. And so, it's fair to say that some of the wells come in much better than expected and some come in less. We're still learning a lot in regards to these wells, and there's still a lot that we think we can change or improve upon to make these wells even better.","So, yeah, there is some variability there, especially, I would point out yes, with our 10,000 foot lateral we just announced. It's also, well, I want to point out that we anticipated having a much higher yield than our previous two 10,000 foot laterals. And so, in that case, we did not flow it back as aggressively from a choke management standpoint. We were interested and with this one, particularly in seeing with choke management, how we could manage that yield. So for that well in particular I don't know that the 30-day rate is as important to us as say the 90 or 180 day rate in terms of the rate we're flowing that well back.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. That's very helpful. Thanks again and good quarter.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. Great results. I was hoping you could speak to whether you can apply the same techniques you've used in the Wolfcamp A recently to the Wolfcamp D? And I know you said you're testing that with at least one well already, but does it have broader applications?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. This is John. We are very encouraged by what we're seeing coming out of the Upper Wolfcamp D wells, with this continuation of improving to frac design and that's why we indeed went to our most current 10,000 foot lateral in the Lower Wolfcamp, the Flying Ebony to apply that design to it. It's just now an flow back, we all have very high expectations for that well. But we also recognized that not any one well makes a trend this year.","But yes going forward, we're very encouraged and let me be also clear, we're not sure that we've really even reached even close to the end number in terms of these frac uplifts, that's why for that Upper Wolfcamp spacing pilot, even though we don't have a well under our belt, we're very comfortable stepping up in the total amount of sand that we're going to pump in those wells because the way we model it with a modest increase in IP and EUR it's a very economic thing to do.","So, we're very pleased with the progress we're seeing here, but we still think there's a lot more to gain.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Drew, this is Tom, I want to follow-up on that. We're very excited by the Wolfcamp A and certainly the results and the uplift we've reported is real and it's grounded in actual results. We probably see the Wolfcamp A as being a better target overall than the Wolfcamp B but the Wolfcamp B is also outstanding, I mean so it's a question of great and outstanding.","But one other things I want to follow-up on is, one other things that make Cimarex strong is our presence in multiple plays and in particular with our footprint in Delaware Basin and our footprint with stack, we're doing a lot of innovation as are our competitors. And every time, we see something that works, we look for opportunities to apply it elsewhere in our own portfolio.","So, having that footprint in multiple plays allows us to really bring innovations in much more quickly than we could if were single basin player. So, there are, as John said, we have a lot of running room in completion optimization in both Wolfcamp A, the Wolfcamp D, and I would add in stack both in the Meramec and Woodford.","All of those plays are trying some things and that laboratory gives us ideas to apply across the board. I don't know that we're even scratching the surface yet in a lot of areas, and we're very, very excited about some of the advancements we're reporting, but we have tremendous uplift yet to happen. And so, it's pretty exciting right now.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for the color, Tom. So just to follow up on that, the results obviously are great in the Wolfcamp A. I know it's been less tested in Culberson, because the returns, I think, for Wolfcamp D had looked so good, and you can hold the acreage by drilling down to the D. But can you give us a better sense of how delineated the Wolfcamp A is across your acreage position?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah, this is John, it's not near as well delineated as it is for the D, that's a very fair statement. The majority of our A drilling to-date has been \u2013 has mainly occurred in Culberson down in the southeast part, that's where we really recognize it and from the way we map it, but I would also tell you that we are now stepping out into other areas of Culberson, and I'm hoping in future earnings release to talk more about those efforts.","But, so far, it's been relegated more to a much smaller area in the southeast than the D, but that's just, as you mentioned early on, we were drilling Ds and a way to hold our acreage and hold all our rights with the Wolfcamp As we've been a little bit more selective, but now with these encouraging results we're seeing, we are quickly stepping out in the other areas of our acreage to get a sense of just how good this could be across the whole position.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Drew, there is tremendous future opportunity to test new zones and the same zone elsewhere in our acreage, not only within Culberson and Eddy County. So, we have a lot of work ahead of us, and it's definitely pointing us to get more and more excited about that asset.","Operator","And our next question comes from Will Derrick of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Will C. Derrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Nice update. I guess first question looking over in the Meramec and Cana Woodford, on the completion time and moving it up to October, what's your expectation on when those wells are all going to come online?","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","This is Joe. We're going to start to see the beginnings of that production late Q4 and into early Q1. We flow the wells back, they clean up and just the timing of the complete row of activity is such that it will end up pretty close to what happened this year with row four, carrying into not only Q4 but into Q1 of this year. I think we'll see the same thing next.","Will C. Derrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then also up there, in terms of the completion design that you all are looking at, how does that differ from what you've seen in the past? Are you using the higher intensity completions you've done recently? What are your thoughts there?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. This is John. I think you're referring to our Woodford development wells, correct?","Will C. Derrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes, sir. Yeah.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. We \u2013 on our previous row, row four, we did quite a bit of experimentation with the frac design there. And in fact, in one case, one section in particular we pumped upwards of 3,200 pounds per foot. That section and those wells are outstanding. I mean, we are just really impressed with the results coming off of that section. And so going forward into this new row development, our base case, and I think Joe alluded to that why we're anticipating the additional cost is to go up to that size of a frac job in the Woodford Shale at 3,200 pounds per foot, whereas before, our standard was more around 1,800 pounds per foot. Again there is cost that are associate with it, but based on the performance we're seeing in on those wells, it's well worth the additional cost to do that. So, that's our go forward plan there for that next row development.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. Tom, I was wondering if you could perhaps give us some more details on the stacked\/staggered pilot that you're doing in the Meramec? In particular, I just wanted to see if you could comment, maybe, on where your completions have been landing today? And just your general thoughts around this pilot coming up?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll answer your question, then I'll turn it over to John, he will have some additions. Landing zone is a real point of experimentation in the Meramec. In the early wells for Cimarex and for many of our competitors, it was, quite frankly, a monkey see, monkey do approach. The Meramec wasn't the most obvious reservoir and so, early wells were kind of targeted based on mimicking what offset wells had done.","And as we've continued to delineate the play, Cimarex and the industry has tested different landing zones. We're testing two different landing zones in that Meramec stacked\/staggered pilot and we continue to experiment with landing zones throughout the play. We're seeing landing zone to be a overprint on production that's greater than we initially anticipated. There are some areas of the play that have underperformed, that we're going back in now and testing new landing zones, new completion techniques and we're quite encouraged by the potential there. But it's a real open part of experimentation as to where we land these laterals.","John, do you want to add to that?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","The only thing I would add is that for that particular spacing pilot, we went the extra step where we went ahead and drilled, what we would call a pilot hole to get additional log information, to really refine where to put those laterals in the Meramec. And I must tell you, I feel pretty good about how we've done this for this particular stacked\/staggered pilot in regards to the data we've received from that pilot, which really helped us pinpoint exactly where we're going to put these laterals. Whereas before, Tom's absolutely be right, we would have looked just say, say two sections over and to see what the company XYZ does as far as where they landed it.","I think we're recognizing that for the Meramec, I mean, every section might have just a slight different tweak to where you want to put that lateral to achieve maximum performance. And that's some of the lessons we're learning as we go forward. So, I'm very excited about the stacked\/staggered pilot and I'm looking forward to when we finally get around to completing it. But as I mentioned, we do have a strong interest in the other operated pilot that is just flowing back now. And there was a lot of science associated with that pilot and we're very anxious to kind of see the flow back, review the science data. And that's why we're not in any rush to go out and frac our current stacked\/staggered till we see some of those results and see how we might then tailor our fracture design for our pilot.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And just my follow-up, you drilled and completed some wells on the updip portion of your acreage and the downdip. Any takeaways or conclusions around well performance on the updip or downdip? Are they similar?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. I think you're referring to Meramec wells or Mississippi wells?","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Pardon me, it's slide 22?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. Well, I guess, I need to just adopt the stack vernacular, I guess.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sorry.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah, we have. Again, delineation wells, sometimes the results were not as we were hoping, other times they're outstanding. So, it's kind of what you expect early on in a play like this where every now and then, you hit a homerun and then \u2013 now and then, you hit one that's not so good. And then really, it's the ones that don't quite meet our expectations that we really, really spend a lot time on saying, okay, what could we have done differently, where could we have landed differently, how do we make it better. And so, yeah, I'd still think there is a lot of improvements still to come in this play based on what I've seen so far.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Arun, Cimarex, I think speaks a little differently than some other companies about the Meramec. I would say, first and foremost, we're very excited about the Meramec. We have a program that is in our estimation top tier. We study our wells. We study our competitors' wells, and we think our results are in that upper class, and we have a lot of data to back that statement up. That said, we do see a fair amount of reservoir variability through the play. We don't view the Meramec as a blanket play. We see a fair amount of variability and that's why John talked about the importance of having pilot holes when we target our laterals. The landing zones can change in short order. The yield can change in short order and the well-performance can change.","Now, we're fairly confident based on the work we're doing that all if not most of those are solvable. Solvable with completion techniques, solvable with smart application of your landing zone, but it's an evolving story. And as we always have done, we're going to talk about results and our results stand on their own. They're quite good.","Operator","Our next question come from Dan Guffey of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Focusing on Reeves County, can you update us with the cumulative production and days online for the Big Timber? And then whether or not you think the strong result is repeatable? And then I guess a few comments how the Upper Wolfcamp in this area stacks up to other Delaware Basin assets that are in your portfolio?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. This is John. I don't have the Big Timber production in front of me right now; we can probably give that information back to you. What I do know is based on that well result as well as some other competitor wells in the area, we feel really, really good about that acreage over there from a 10,000 foot lateral standpoint. So good, as I mentioned in my comments, that we are moving forward with the development plans that we're doing in Reeves County with the 10,000 foot stacked\/staggered development that we'll initiate \u2013 in fact that's started drilling on right now.","It's a very good area for the Upper Wolfcamp and I think our Anaconda pilots really demonstrated to us that it's not just a good area, it's thick enough to support multiple levels of wells in that shale. So going forward, we're very, very excited about that area and the results we'll get, especially from this development that we're currently drilling right now.","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I guess, as it competes for capital in other areas in your Delaware Basin program, I guess, assuming commodity price, assuming the strip currently isn't competitive with other assets in your portfolio, do you have any constraints such as infrastructure that may limit future development as you head into 2017?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Sure. I'll take the stab at that. It competes very well with the other things we have in our portfolio. The thing that's driving a lot of our capital this year, as we've mentioned. is acreage holing. And in particular in Reeves, we have a lot of acreage there that's still on a primary term that we definitely want to hold. So, there is quite a bit of capital going that way. It is fair to say that once we get to the point, where we've excess capital beyond holding acreage, then we have to look \u2013 and any time we make those decisions, then it's factors such as, yes, always rate of return and takeaway issues and water sourcing as Joe mentioned, and other factors that lead to where we deploy that capital. But in terms of optional capital spending Reeves, holds its own pretty well compared to Culberson right now.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Dan one of the things that drives that, isn't just the rocks, but it's also our ability to drill that longer lateral.","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And so one of the things that makes Culberson such a beautiful asset for us, not only is it multiple zone, some of which we haven't even tested yet, but we can drill long laterals at will, there is no constraint there over that entire acreage block.","That's generally true in Reeves, but there are areas where that's not true and what Cimarex is doing and a lot of operators are focused on, I think there's wide spread recognition of the economic uplift of these longer wells. And so there are some trades going on to let us block up that area and be in a better place to drill long laterals. But as far as the rock goes, it's highly competitive with other things we've got.","Operator","And our next question come from Jason Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jason.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So to kick that prior question on capital allocation maybe a step further, and just thinking about the portfolio as a whole. Now that you've drilled more wells in the Meramec and are getting more confident in your Upper Wolfcamp wells \u2013 I'm not going to ask you, Tom, when you're going to go back to work. But just a question around where that first incremental dollar goes, when you do go back to work?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Back to work, Jason. You see golf pants on us?","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I should have worded that one a little better.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, the challenge is it's a really evolving story. And if we had the snapshot of today, and we said, you know what, based on what we know today we have to make long-term capital allocation decisions. There'll probably be a bias for a lot of our Delaware program not only the Bone Spring but the Avalon looks quite good and these long wells in the Wolfcamp, those are all cream of the crop.","But we are still seeing not only the Meramec but I'd still throw the Woodford in the mix, that with our \u2013 the experiments we're doing with our completion innovations, we're seeing a really improving story there. And so, in the near-term, we're going to continue to experiment. I mean, we want to have an active program in both basins because what we learn is setting the stage for a long-term capital allocation. I mean, you've heard us talk about in the Woodford, we have some projects that would be stacked Meramec and Woodford that once we kick them off, they are hundreds of 10,000 foot long wells. I mean, it's a real opportunity for Cimarex. So we're not just going to snapshot today its evolving story.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah, this is John I'll just follow-up. Especially in today's market, to what Tom said, completion costs are really surprisingly enough to me they've gotten a little softer on the service cost side. But as an example to just take our total company frac stats now is the time to try this experimentation. Our early 2016 average frac statistics compared to our 2015 averages such that we're drilling \u2013 we're completing 11% longer laterals, pumping 23% more fluid, 30% more sand and when you look at it all-in, cost reduction per well including water sourcing, we're seeing a reduction of 5% and our completion cost even with those increases. So now is the time to try those experiments.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And just one quick one on the Avalon. A few of your peers have talked about it this quarter. I think that it's held by production for you guys. Any change in your thoughts around allocating some capital there or doing any further tests in that zone?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well, this is John. Actually I think about two days ago, I was in Midland and reviewed our latest Avalon well with our latest generation of frac design and it's fantastic, it's a great well. And the challenge again as you mentioned is all held by production. And so right now, we would must rather spend that capital to hold the rest of our acreage position throughout the Wolfcamp.","But, I got to tell you, I got a team down there, this is just itching to go on a two-mile lateral and the Avalon and the numbers look great. But it's just a matter of capital allocation right now, where we think obviously our best interest is to go out there and deploy that capital and hold our acreage for this year. But they're raring to go and at some point, especially since we've already got a number of the spacing pilots done where we're already at eight wells per section of each interval within the Avalon, there are several benches. So it looked really good, it's just a question of when we get to a point where I guess as someone said, we get back to work and start drilling some more wells out there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeanine Wai of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jeanine.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So on the fourth-quarter call, you all provided us with your estimated year end 2016 cash balance of I think it was $400 million. And with the $50 million CapEx increase that you announced last night, what's your new estimated cash balance at year end 2016? And realizing that the strip has moved up in the meantime?","G. Mark Burford - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah. Jeanine. Hi, good morning this is Mark here. Yeah using a early May 2 strip price with that incremental capital in our new volume forecast, we're still expecting actually, it's gone up a bit from $400 million to maybe $450 million, the way it looks right now, Jeanine. So, it's something we're closely watching and seeing how that moves through the year. But even with the increased capital you expect that cash balance to be even a bit higher than we had previously forecasted.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And Jeanine, I want to give just a little bit of detail in that CapEx increase. On our fourth quarter call, we were at a range of $600 million to $650 million and we said the upper-end of that $650 million would be if those completions rolled into 2016. So, those completions have rolled into 2016. So if we wanted to benchmark us against the fourth quarter, we'd be at that $650 million number we talked about.","Now we gave a range of guidance of $650 million to $700 million. So, really we kind of deal with midpoint, midpoint is $675 million. So really it's a $25 million increase over where we were in our fourth quarter call given that those completions are accelerated. So although, it looks like $50 million, I think that's probably just an absolute upper-end of that.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great, that's really helpful. And my follow-up, so it sounds like you have more cash \u2013 slightly more cash than you previously thought, and you're finding more ways to spend your cash flow. So what are the next opportunities you have to spend more CapEx on, if you spend any more at all?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll take that, this is Tom. We've got lots to do and certainly we have a lot of projects that are begging for capital in the Delaware Basin and these are as John said, the list is long and long and long. And then this Meramec delineation probably is one that we'd easily be able to throw a little capital at. And then we're also, we've talked in the past about we're doing some exploration. I mean, this is the time when we are kind of keying on what our organization does best and our value proposition has always been centered around doing good geoscience, finding ideas that give us competitive advantage and getting acreage positions ahead of the crowd. And so we're putting a lot of emphasis on that as well and there will be some opportunities to come out of that.","So depending on what the landscape looks like over the next six months, I think there is a reasonable chance that we may do a little more. We're going to need to see the fundamental shore up. We're going to need to have confidence that this price file is affordable, but we are ready to roll with cash and balance sheet to do it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Please go ahead.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Maybe follow up a little on that, while we're on the topic. Just bigger picture, as I think about capital allocation in this cycle, what's your perspective on out-spending cash flow? You mentioned earlier in the remarks that you think within cash flow on the strip, you can get back to growth in the years ahead. I appreciate that certainly, but will end the year with a substantial amount of cash on hand, already a very differentiated balance sheet. And I'm just thinking through this \u2013 where we are in the cycle. You've got productivity trending up and to the right. Costs are at cyclical lows. How do you think about out-spending cash flow, as we move further forward in 2017? Given the current environment, is that something you'd be more likely to do than at other points in the cycle?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Michael, I'll take that one. This is Tom. We are very willing to outspend cash flow, and the way I think about it is very simple, it's about creating value. If we can borrow money at low interest rate and invest it in the high interest rate, I think as long as we're confident in those returns that's a value creating proposition for our shareholder. And with our top-tier assets, I think our bias as a management team is to bring that value forward for our shareholders.","Now that said, when you drill a well, those returns are predicated on a discounted cash flow that makes some significant assumptions about future commodity pricing. And the quality of that assumption is key. If we get to a point to where we gain confidence about that future commodity pricing, if we think that the markets have kind of worked themselves out and they're in balance. And we get asked about at what price file, it's not about the price file. We have the opportunities today at this price file to accelerate and add value. It's about our confidence in that price file and that the markets are in balance and that we think that it's a fairly low volatile proposition.","So, I think our bias is going to be to invest, use our balance sheet and yes, we'd be willing to modestly outspend cash flow. Mark, do you want to answer that?","G. Mark Burford - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, no, I completely concur with Tom here. It's gaining confidence in our future curve. And now we're seeing kind of same thing as we think about increasing activity, the current curve suggest that we have lots of economic wells to drill. But we've seen a couple head fakes seen the commodity price reverse. A lot of movement to date has probably been driven on expectation of continued oil production than inventories improving, which we're starting to see. But we want to see more continuation of that and making sure that forward strip is really kind of intact and based on the fundamentals.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll say just one last thing on that. We do an annual look back, and many of you've heard us talk about that in the past, and John and I spent two hours yesterday, reviewing our annual look back, going back on our history of economic performance. And there are some real lessons there. And one of the lessons is you really have to have confidence on that commodity price file. I mean there's a lot of lessons in that. And it's about being good at the business, making sure you have high quality assets, and being very prudent in your investments.","And I think Cimarex has a long history of success on that front, and we're going to continue to stay disciplined. We have the luxury of top tier assets, and outstanding returns in this current price environment. So we're going to be ready to roll, and I think you \u2013 I think it's reasonable for you to expect with a little stability in commodity pricing, you will see Cimarex pick up the pace.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","I appreciate that color. That's very helpful. I guess my follow-up, stepping way back again, high level. If you just look at the Meramec today, and this might be a little tricky to answer, but just given all the moving pieces in the world. But if you look at the Meramec today, and you try to compare that to the year of learning curve for the Wolfcamp and the Del Basin. So looking back in time, in the Delaware Basin and on Wolfcamp, what year would you think we're in if we were to try and characterize the Meramec today? Does that makes sense?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well, this is John. And I guess I'll take a stab at it. It's interesting you asked that. I've been actually kind of going down memory lane, and just recently talked with our lead generator for Culberson. And I'd forgotten that Culberson started in 2006 for us. So, we're in year 10 in Culberson and I'm going to tell you right now, we still don't know everything about Wolfcamp and Culberson; obvious by our well results and what we continue to do.","Whereas we're in year two of Meramec and I just think we've scratched the surface. There's just so much that we are learning with each well, both us and our competitors and in some way, yes, it is happening at a far more accelerated paced than Culberson ever did because we were the only game in town when we were doing Culberson. Here, as you well are aware, we have at least five other operators drilling all around us, and we're all looking at each other kind of figure out what works best, where should I go, where do I land. And so clearly, it's at a much more accelerated pace, but sometimes I wonder maybe too fast, honestly, in that you never really get a chance to really catch your breath and look at the data and look at the results \u2013 not just that 30-day rate as I mentioned \u2013 but what is the well doing 180 days later. And is it surprising you and so \u2013 there are sometimes I wish we went to little bit slower to be honest in Meramec \u2013 but in some ways we're being forced to just with the competition.","So, I don't know if that answers your question, but that's just my perspective on what's going on in the Meramec right now.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","We saw the same \u2013 this is Joe. We saw the same thing in Cana. We kicked off that program in 2007 and it's 2014 where a frac design revolutionizes the play. So, boy, that's a tough question. Where is the end-game on how well these wells can produce, is the real question there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Grigel of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning, and actually a good segue into the question I had here, focusing in on the Meramec. Going back to the commentary on the landing zone and some of the variability, how do you address those challenges in the variability, as you apply the downspacing tests, going forward, both the results from yours and Devon's, across the broader acreage position?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. That's a great question. It's something that we talk about all the time. Part of it is sometimes in some of these sections, we're blessed to have, quite frankly, quite a bit of vertical control within the section to give us an idea of what variability we should expect. In other cases, quite frankly we've reached the point, we said we just got to go ahead and drill and create that information by drilling a pilot hole.","I would also tell you in some ways we're putting even more renewed emphasis on our 3D seismic coverage because at least with 3D seismic, you are sampling the geology, so to speak, in a much finer scale. So we're really trying to incorporate that as a tool to help us along with the subsurface control and the horizontal wells that have been drilled to date to build a more comprehensive model of what's going on and what we should expect going forward.","I would just tell you that, again, right now, we have expectations for every Meramec well we drill, and each one in some way typically surprises us fortunately to the positive, but also sometimes to the negative. So as we go forward, we'll continue to look for ways to get more comfortable with that variability and be able to adjust to it appropriately.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Well, thanks. And then maybe a follow-up here, for Tom. Could you just talk about the current M&A outlook and what you're seeing in both the Permian as well as in the Mid-Con?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we see opportunities and we're always in the hunt as we've talked in past calls. There's not a point in time, where we're not evaluating something. Our challenge is we want to create value and I think if you look at the history of M&A, in E&P and in other industries, it's a fairly challenging landscape for acquirers to make the argument that over the long run, that's been a real good value-creating strategy. Now, hey, maybe we count our money differently than others do, but we are who we are and we want to be forthright in our approach to the business.","We look at full cycle value creation, we look at time to capital, we look at what the pace of development will be and will that generate a rate of return for our shareholders? Some of these splashy acquisition deals are good for everybody that participates except for the shareholder. And our focus first and foremost is on shareholder value.","So, as I've said in the past, there are assets we covet. I mean, there are some really outstanding assets on the market and some really outstanding assets that have transacted. And we've been in that game and we often are at a valuation point where we are just flat out unwilling to get the number that's the winning bid.","We ask ourselves at every turn what's our competitive advantage. If we don't have a competitive advantage, and that's generally either information, science or our ability to execute well above and beyond our competitors, then we're just bidding discount rate and commodity price forecast with a group of very well-funded competitors. And that's just not a winning proposition for the Cimarex shareholder. So, we look \u2013 I'm very hopeful that there'll be opportunities for us and when we find the right one, we'll strike. But it will be right because we had a competitive advantage.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Nelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. We've already belabored the re-acceleration point. But if I could just ask, would it be reasonable to assume the planned drop of rigs around midyear is probably a good catalyst for you to reevaluate if that commodity outlook has stabilized, rather than risk losing efficiency gains \u2013 efficiencies kind of with those rigs?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, that's reasonable. Hey, we're not happy about going down to four, then three rigs, but we're going to do what we need to do to preserve that balance sheet and make sure that we're well positioned for the future.","We may be getting the wrong feedback. We've always kept our debt low and our conclusion from what we've seen over the last 24 months is that was a prudent course of action because we have a lot of flexibility today in an arena where many of our competitors do not. So we're going to be careful, but nobody is unhappier with us going down to three rigs than we are, but it's what we have to do and we are going to stay disciplined.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","And this is Joe. I'll follow-up, from a rig standpoint, when we added rigs earlier, a couple of months back, we got good iron, good crews. And I don't \u2013 in fact one of the rigs we got back drilled a record well. So I think the quality of the rigs and the people right now when \u2013 if and when we do pick them up, I feel very confident we will get a good efficient optimized service provided to us.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And then just for my follow-up, I appreciate the help on providing the exit rate in your commentary. Should we expect oil mix to be constant, as well, with the 4Q 2015 level? Or should that be down?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","For the year, we may end up being slightly more on the gas side at the end of the year. You want to add to that Mark?","G. Mark Burford - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, no, it's pretty consistent, John. We're at 28% oil in the first quarter and mid-year within that 0.5% of that is what we see for the fourth quarter. So it's pretty consistent.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Acierno for any final remarks.","Karen Acierno - Director of Investor Relations","Thanks, Rocco. So, before we signoff, I have received some information on the Big Timber well, so I can give you the Q production, Dan, if you're still on. So, it's produced for 320 days. It's produced 250,000 barrels of oil, and about a 1.1 Bcf of wet gas.","So, with that, we'll say good bye, and have a nice day. And thanks for joining us.","Operator","And thank you, ma'am.

Our CFO Mark Burford is also here to help answer any questions.","And so, that we can accommodate everybody's questions during the hour that we have allotted for the call, we'd like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Feel free to get back in the queue after that, if you like.","And so, with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Karen, and thanks to everyone who's participating in today's call. As always, we appreciate your interest and look forward to your questions during the question-and-answer portion of the call.","On the call today, John will walk us through our recent results and describe our progress on some of the delineation projects that we have underway. This will include results from delineation in the Meramec and completion modifications that have further improved our results in the Lower Wolfcamp. In the Meramec, John will discuss results from two recent 10,000 foot horizontal wells that are significant in their performance that they're also encouraging in the manner in which they're delineating our acreage.","In the Wolfcamp, John will discuss some recent results from completion optimization, including an outstanding recent 10,000 foot well in Lower Wolfcamp in Culberson County. We're making great strides in improving our well results across our portfolio. Additionally, we are confirming our optimism, regarding the uplift we see from 10,000 foot horizontal wells. Not only are these wells delivering outstanding 30-day and 180-day rates, they're exhibiting surprisingly low decline.","Joe will follow John with an operational overview, including some of the steps we have taken to improve field efficiencies. As Joe will describe, he and his team have made great progress in getting our lease operating expenses down. There are many components to the progress that Joe will report, including smart, well-engineered water management; personnel and equipment efficiencies; lift-off to optimization; compressor optimization; and others. The result in savings in current and future lease operating expenses are significant to Cimarex.","We reported another production beat this quarter, driven by continued improvement in well performance. Our total company production was 974,000 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the second quarter, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Gas production was up, while oil production was down slightly. As we had forecasted, this was due to fewer well completions in the Permian Basin due to the timing of our infill and spacing \u2013 pilot completions.","As we pick up the pace in our Permian completions during the second half of the year, we expect our oil production to turn upwards. Combined with oil production expected from the Woodford completions in East Cana, we expect oil production to be up approximately 15% in the fourth quarter versus second quarter levels.","Operating expenses, with the exception of G&A, came in within guidance, resulting in a strong quarter overall. G&A was slightly above guidance, as we record the cost of an early retirement package offered to employees in the first quarter that was finalized in June.","We also announced an increase in our 2016 capital budget. We have raised our guidance from a range of $650 million to $700 million of exploration and development capital to $750 million for 2016. This includes $600 million earmarked for drilling and completions, up $100 million from the high-end of our previous guidance. The increased capital will be used to further delineate the Meramec formation in the Anadarko Basin, push the completion of Woodford infill wells forward, and add a handful of new wells to our Delaware Basin program.","Our bigger more effective stimulations are also adding to our capital. This is money well spent as shown by our well results. We now see our operated rig count holding at five rigs for the remainder of 2016.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide further color in our program.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter, before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results, and more color on our remaining 2016 plans. Cimarex invested $156 million on exploration and development during the second quarter. About 65% was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going toward activities in Mid-Continent region.","Companywide, we've brought 34 gross, 14 net wells on production during the quarter. We had an average of nine operated rigs running during the quarter. These rigs were busy working to hold acreage in both the Wolfcamp and Meramec plays, as well as drilling spacing pilots in both the Delaware Basin and Mid-Continent. That activity is winding down, and we are currently running five rigs, three rigs in the Permian and two rigs in Anadarko, an activity level we intend to maintain through the rest of 2016.","While a lot of focus is put on the number of rigs Cimarex is running, completion of the wells has the biggest impact on both well cost and well performance. We are continuing to push the envelope on well completions.","On page 30 of our presentation, we illustrate the evolution of completion size, as measured in pounds of sand per lateral foot drilled. As you can see, completions are evolving across the company. We have several other slides in our presentation that illustrate the uplift we've seen in several of these plays, including the Upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County and now the Lower Wolfcamp as shown on slide 12.","Our most recent Lower Wolfcamp well, the Flying Ebony 19 State A #5H, was completed with 2,400 pounds of sand per lateral foot and had an average 30 day IP of 3,127 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 23% was oil, 46% gas and 29% was NGL. On average, that IP is 36% higher than previous completions.","The success of the frac design used on the Flying Ebony is more than just a pound of sand per foot increase. It is a direct consequence of Cimarex developing a strong understanding of the geology and walk mechanics for this interval, which in turn leads to design changes not just in the amount of sand pumped, but also in the type of sand, cluster design, cluster count, stage spacing, along with the type of fluid. This type of detailed frac design is taking place internally for each of our prospective zones in both basins, which is leading to the strong well performances that we have been achieving across the board.","Regarding our New Mexico Avalon Shale program, Cimarex drilled and completed the 5,000 foot Triste Draw 25 Fed #7H late last year, implementing an upsized stimulation design, in order to determine that we could achieve improved performance for this interval as seen in other Permian shale intervals.","As shown on slide 17 in our presentation, the results for this well have been outstanding. The well achieved a 30-day peak IP rate of 1,811 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 59% was oil, 20% gas, and 22% NGL, with a very impressive 180-day rate of 1,317 barrels of oil equivalent per day and a 180-day cum of 230,000 barrels of oil equivalent. This kind of result certainly raises the Avalon program to top tier for us, going forward.","Capital to be invested in the Permian in the second half of 2016 will be focused on completion activity and acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson County and Reeves County. The total capital ascribed to acreage holding in Delaware Basin is just over $230 million in 2016. We currently have three rigs running in Delaware Basin and expect to keep them active through the remainder of 2016.","Now, on to the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford development project on the east side of the Cana core in the fourth quarter 2015. This development covers six sections, of which Cimarex operates two sections. This infill project consists of 47 gross, 22 net wells. Drilling is finished, and completion of the wells has again been moved up and is now scheduled for early September versus October, as was discussed in our last call. This change in scheduling was a contributing factor to our increase in capital expenditures for 2016.","As for the Meramec, we continue to drill wells to both hold our acreage and delineate our acreage position. Of note are two of our most recent Meramec results, the Peterson and Sims long laterals, whose location can be seen on slide 19 of the presentation. The Peterson 1H-2821X, located in the northwest part of our Meramec acreage position, achieved a 30-day peak average rate of 19 million cubic feet equivalent per day, of which 54% was oil, 30% gas, 16% NGL, while the Sims 1H-2017X, located in the southeastern part of our Meramec acreage, achieved a 30-day average rate of 12.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day, 29% oil, 46% gas, 25% NGL. These two bookend wells on our acreage are good confirmation of our ability to adjust both the landing zone and frac design to achieve very good rate of return results across the breadth of our Meramec acreage, and is why we have chosen to keep two rigs running throughout the remainder of the year, holding Meramec acreage.","Finally, to better understand the multi-zone potential for this area, we have recently finished drilling an eight well stacked\/staggered spacing pilot in the Meramec and Woodford formations. See slide 21 for an illustration of this design. These wells are scheduled to begin completion operations later this month, with first production anticipated in the fourth quarter.","Results from another Meramec spacing pilot were recently announced by our partner Devon. The Alma pilot wells had an average IP of 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 60% was oil. The completion of these wells was influential in the stimulation design for the Meramec wells in our stacked\/staggered pilot, with the final Meramec design using 2,600 pounds of sand per lateral foot. Cimarex holds a 46% working interest in this pilot.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","Thank you, John. And thank you all for joining our call today. I'll touch on the usual items, our second quarter production, our Q3 and full year 2016 production outlook, and then finish up with a few comments on LOE and service cost.","As Tom mentioned, we had yet another great quarter for production, with stronger-than-expected base property and new well performance really driving the quarter. Our second quarter volumes came in better than anticipated. Our reported Q2 total company net equivalent production of 974 million a day, beat our guidance projection of 935 million a day to 965 million a day and was up slightly to our Q1 reported volume of 973 million a day, rather than down, as we had anticipated last call.","As expected, with the accelerated completion activity and increased processing capacity during the second quarter, we saw a nice boost in our Permian production, with the addition of a second frac crew in May. We completed nine Permian wells during the quarter, as compared to just three wells in the first quarter. As a result, our second quarter Permian equivalent volume came in at 509 million a day. That's up 32 million a day or 7% from the first quarter.","In the Mid-Continent, continued strong well performance from our Cana-Woodford project, which came online in late fourth quarter last year, supported both our Q1 and our Q2 Mid-Continent volumes. And with that support, our second quarter Mid-Continent equivalent volume averaged 463 million a day, that's up 44 million a day or 11% from Q2 2015. But as expected, with only five new wells in the Mid-Continent coming online during the quarter, our second quarter Mid-Continent volumes decreased $30 million a day as compared to Q1.","So, as we look forward into the last half of 2016, we're projecting a further acceleration of completion activity in both our Mid-Continent and Permian programs. And as a result, we're projecting a total of 72 net wells to come online during the year, as compared to the 60 net wells we projected last call, with seven wells of those additional wells been located in the Permian and five wells in the Mid-Continent.","In the Mid-Continent, we've moved up the start date for Cana infill development project to September, as has been previously as stated, and that's, again, versus a previous estimate of October. And in the Permian, with the planned additional of the third rig in August, we've also accelerated our completion activity, for the most part, in fourth quarter for both of our Bone Spring and Reeves County Wolfcamp programs. As a result, we now anticipate having 22 net wells waiting on completion at year-end with 11 net wells in both the Mid-Continent and the Permian. And that's down from the 46 total wells that we had waiting on completion here at the end of Q2.","With our strong first half performance and our planned acceleration and completion activity, we've increased our total company full year of production guidance to 0.98 Bcfe to 1 Bcfe per day. That's up from our previous guidance of 940 million a day to 970 million a day to and would put us, in essence, flat to 2% higher than our 2015 average of 984.5 million a day.","More importantly, our planned acceleration \u2013 accelerated completion activity gives us very strong momentum going into 2017, with our forecasted Q4 exit rate in the range of 1.02 Bcfe per day to 1.07 Bcfe per day. That's 3% to 9% higher than the 986 million a day we posted in Q4 2015. Our oil production plays a big role in our projected Q4 exit rate, with our Q4 Permian and Mid-Continent net oil volumes forecasted to be up 12% to 17% from the volumes that we reported in Q2.","For Q3 2016, with 10 net Permian wells and three net Mid-Continent wells expected to come online during the quarter, we're guiding our total company net equivalent volumes to be in the range of 950 million a day to 980 million a day, that's, in essence, flat with the second quarter. And as we move into Q4, our completion activity really picks up steam with 15 net Permian wells and 26 net Mid-Continent wells planned to come online in the fourth quarter.","Shifting gears to OpEx. We had a nice guidance beat with our second quarter LOE, and we owe it all to our production groups' continued and dedicated efforts to optimally reduce our overall operating cost structure. With their focus, we once again saw sizable cost reductions during the quarter and similar components as in quarters past: salt water disposal; compression; rentals; contract labor.","And as such, our Q2 lifting cost came in at $0.65 per Mcfe, well below the low end of our guidance, which was $0.80 per Mcfe to $0.90 per Mcfe, down 19% from our first quarter average of $0.80 per Mcfe and down 22% from the $0.83 per Mcfe we averaged in 2015. So, after incorporating our continued cost control efforts and also taking into account the fluctuating nature of workover expenses, we projected our remaining year lifting cost to be in the range of $0.60 per Mcfe to $0.75 per Mcfe.","I'll take a moment just to say we're extremely proud of our entire production ops team for their success and safely and effective reducing our LOE. The progress is sizable. Since prices began falling back in 2014, we've seen an \u2013 our absolute monthly net LOE drop approximately $9 million a month, which on an annualized basis, it has in essence freed up over $100 million a year that we can direct to our drilling program.","And finally on service cost, some very similar comments to our last call with regard to drilling and completion cost. Most all of our drilling cost components have remained relatively in check, while we have seen some modest reductions in per unit completion cost primarily in the Permian. On the drilling side, we have kept our focus on efficiencies as illustrated with our average 2016 Bone Spring spud to rig release drill time of 10 days, that's down from 12 days in 2015 and 14 days in 2014.","On the completion side, we've seen continued cost reductions in the Permian, both from a frac cost standpoint, as well as in the cost to source our water, which has really helped to negate the additional cost of us pumping larger jobs. As we continue to increase our frac size, completion dollars continue to dominate our total well cost, representing up to two-thirds of the individual total well cost for each well.","As in quarters past, we've been able to offset the cost of the larger fracs with lower per unit pumping cost. And as such, most of our generic AFEs have remained somewhat in check as compared to last quarter. An exception however is our Permian Bone Spring program where both drilling and completion efficiencies have reduced our current one mile lateral AFEs to $4.7 million to $5.1 million, that's down 6% from the $5 million to $5.4 million that we quoted last quarter.","In the Wolfcamp, with larger completions, our current generic two-mile lateral Culberson AFEs continue to run in a $10.2 million to $11.2 million range. That's like the last call, but down 5% from where we were in Q4 and down 23% from that program's AFE back in late 2014. With our larger frac design, our Cana core one-mile lateral Woodford AFE is running in the range of $7.1 million to $7.5 million, up from the $6.6 million to $7 million range we previously quoted with the smaller frac, but right in line with the $500,000 to $600,000 anticipated increase that we quoted last call, should we adopt and implement the larger fracs, which we are.","But even with the larger frac, our current Cana one-mile Woodford well is down 10% on a total well cost as compared to late 2014. As we drill more two-mile lateral Meramec wells, our current AFEs are running in the range of $10.7 million to $11.4 million, all the while we continue to experiment with various frac designs and land in-depths and so on.","In closing, we had another great quarter. We made tremendous strides reducing our overall operating cost structure. We're staying focused on efficiencies to reduce and optimize our drilling and completion cost. And we continue to make good progress, maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question today comes from Drew Venker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Drew.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Tom, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the Upper Wolfcamp pilot in Culberson County, realize it's still early but any \u2013 even just geologic information you obtained so far in that pilot?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll just make a quick comment and then turn it over to John for perhaps further obfuscation. We're just now flowing it back, I don't even think we have two weeks on that, and so it's really is too early to tell. That's an area that we have very high expectations for. It's a great geologic target, and I think that we have lots to learn in terms of well density there and certainly all the optimizations going on throughout our organization will be used in refining our next test, but that particular pilot, Drew, it really is too early to tell.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. Drew, this is John, and I'll just echo of what Tom just said. I mean, it is very early and the flowback of the wells are just now cleaning up. I'll just say, operationally, everything went just fine from a frac standpoint. Everything looked good, so we'll just \u2013 time will tell, as we flowing back and as we get enough data in hand and hopefully here in the near future, we've got to talk about them.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. One thing if I just tandem to, we're really fascinated. I mentioned in my opening remarks that it's two things we're seeing with a lot of these Wolfcamp wells. One is the enhanced well performance, but the other is the lower decline from our longer laterals and that's \u2013 I don't want that to be lost on observers. It's really a remarkable result, and it takes some time to watch that and see it stabilize. In fact, some wells we have that have been on for six months are still surprising us. And so, it's \u2013 we'll talk about it as soon as we can make conclusions.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","And I guess I'll follow-up with Tom. He's absolutely right, and that it's difficult \u2013 it's very difficult to really predict an ultimate EUR for some of these wells until a good four, five, six months out that we finally start seeing some form of decline, so we can then model what it's ultimately going to end up at. So, that's a good problem to have, quite frankly; but it just means it takes quite a while before we finally reach the point we feel really good about what that ultimate EUR will be for the well.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. The results are great, and I think they keeps surprising to the upside. I guess, it kind of begs the question of how do you progress through this completion design evolution? You have obviously a ton of projects that you want to execute on, and it seems like the more and more you test bigger and more complex completions, you keep getting much, much more return than the capital you put in. So, how is the \u2013 what's your strategy for reaching that optimal well design to quickest?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, one is pick up the pace in our capital and that's a significant reason and justification why we decided to keep five rigs going and accelerate our completions just gives us more laboratories. And I'm very proud of our organization and the degree of innovation that they're undertaking. We study our competitors hard. I think you all know us well enough not be surprised by that statement. But it's also strength of Cimarex to be in two of the most active basins in the country, to be in the Delaware Basin and the stack play means that we have two independent laboratories and we can draw and bring best practices from one play to another. And that has also been a really big part of our success and we're just getting warmed up there. We have lots of things in our list to try, and many of them are things that have been tried in one basin but haven't been tried in the other.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","And, this is John, I think the only other comment I'd make is we put a lot of debate internally on these frac design changes and we involve all disciplines when it comes to that and then we measure ourselves quickly. Like you've pointed out, there's incremental capital involved that does drive up our overall total cost. And so, we're asking ourselves, what type of improvement justifies this, what should we be looking for early in the life of these wells that say, this is a good investment decision, keep moving forward with it. And quite frankly, once we achieve that, in the middle, we're asking ourselves, okay, can we go even further, what's next.","And that's what I'm kind of proud of is that we are not resting on our laurels here. And as much as I really love the landscape right now, what we've achieved and what it looks like from a rate of return perspective, we are not going to just sit pat and say, okay, this is it; we're going to keep pushing. Because there is still so much that we're learning about these rocks and these frac designs that and I still think there's a lot of potential there.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. I'll leave it there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Will Derrick from SunTrust. Please go ahead with your question.","Will C. Derrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. I guess, first question, looking at the stack and everything you got going around there and Canadian County specifically, curious what your thoughts on those initial wells are and what your plans are for activity going forward there?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Will, this is John. I guess you're referencing in particular Canadian County where we have drilled a number of Meramec wells, including the latest one we just talked about, which is our Sims well. That area, I would just say, has been a little bit more of a challenge for the Meramec than necessarily, say, more of the Blaine Kingfisher, but that's why we're really proud of that Sims result in that part of the play.","I think that's also why we've decided to add a little bit more capital because now we feel a little bit better about that area, but it's also one that's going to take a little bit more drilling as we get more comfortable with landing zone and frac design. And again, I want to stress that, there is no one recipe here in the Meramec, say, in one area that works best across the whole play. We're definitely changing things up and adapting to results. And again, I'll just emphasize, that's why we really like that Sims result. That one really has given us a little bit more \u2013 definite more encouragement toward that part of the Meramec play.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's really a changing story. (28:05) You hear us keep talking about the variability in the Meramec. Even around that Sims well, we had some results from us and some competitors that led us to think, oh, should we drill this well or not. And we tried some different things and it's a stunning and surprisingly positive result, and that tells us, you know what, it's not over until it's over. This Meramec really is a function of landing zone and completion design and that section has lots of surprises left and, thus far, surprise in the upside.","Will C. Derrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Could you quantify the differences in completion that you've had in Blaine County versus on the Sims well?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well, this is John, and I'm going to \u2013 in broad brush strokes, maybe, the differences, clearly there is always the amount of sand we pump. There are going to be differences in the cluster design, cluster spacing, and quite frankly, there's differences on whether or not we use diverters. And all of those are kind of in our bag of tricks to look at. I will just say right now, state that again, the Peterson design was way different than the Sims design, and what we're trying to do now is go out there and check on that, do a couple of more wells and see, does one work better in one area than one in the other and then we'll continue to progress from there.","Will C. Derrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason S. Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone and congrats. Tom, I just wanted to ask on capital allocation. It looks like you guys have a \u2013 looks like a pretty good problem, given all your impressive results across multiple geographic areas. So just, how are you thinking about prioritization of capital by both geographic area and zone? And I guess what I'm getting at is what gets the first call and how do you rank your plays right now?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, It's a great question, Jason. And it is a challenge, and it's a pretty high class problem to have. We have two outstanding plays and we have outstanding acreage positions in both plays and acreage positions that allow for 10,000-foot long horizontal wells. You sum all that together and it's a real dilemma on how we allocate capital. Now, I will say as I've said in the past that some of our best well level returns are in the Bone Spring in the Delaware Basin, certainly the 10,000-foot long Wolfcamp wells are fantastic and getting better and, as John said, the Avalon is really roaring to compete heads up with everything I've just mentioned.","I would say that Delaware at the well level rate of return is at the top of the pack, but that Anadarko story is evolving and not very far behind. If some of these new landing zones and new stimulations, if the Sims, Peterson, and some of the wells announced by our competitors, if these results are repeatable across large portion of our 115,000 Meramec acres, then it's going to really give us angst on how we allocate capital, because there is also science and delineation we want to do.","So, we're always balancing what's the absolute high rate of return on our next investment, with looking 5, 10 years ahead, what information do we want and when do we want it. So, in terms of capital allocation, we are going ahead with three rigs in the Delaware and two rigs in the stack play. And we think both those rigs \u2013 both those programs are designed to give us a lot of information, both landing zone, completion optimization, and geological delineation.","And so, we're fairly comfortable with that three-rig Delaware, two-rig Anadarko right now. If prices were to improve materially, I think it's a function of if oil or gas improves. But right now, the Delaware is probably the strongest voice for incremental capital, if we were to increase above and beyond that.","Jason S. Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Tom. And I guess my follow-up is, one thing you guys didn't really discuss in the prepared remarks was Reeves County, where the Cabinet State well also looks really, really strong and on a shorter lateral. So, can you maybe just talk about that well, what you guys did and does that maybe drive you guys to flock more toward shorter laterals in that play?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well, this is John. Yeah, shame on me, the Cabinet State is an outstanding well and we're very, very pleased with that result. And the reality is, I wish I could have made it a 10,000-foot lateral, but that particular case, we were landlocked to where to hold that acreage was a 5,000-foot lateral. And in that particular play, we clearly, in our own minds, had demonstrated the uplift to going to 10,000-foot lateral. So, just imagine, taking the Cabinet State and taking it 10,000-foot lateral, it would be even that much better.","I think what you're also seeing at Cabinet State is again, and Tom does a nice job of talking about this, just us leveraging frac design changes, say, in the Upper Wolfcamp and Culberson over to Reeves and back and forth, and that's a good example. Along with we have our major development there next to the Big Timber, where we're about to start fracking with the Wood wells. We're clearly taking that frac design that we implemented over on the Upper Wolfcamp pilot there over to those wells. So, we're seeing really good results there throughout that part of Reeves County, and we're very excited about it, and we got a lot of drilling to do there for the remainder of this year and the next year.","And then finally, when I think about it, the things also that's changing there and we talk a lot about is landing zone. We are definitely getting much more comfortable in Reeves as to where we want land those wells, and I think it's leading to the kind of results you're seeing as well. So, it's kind of combination \u2013 kind of sounds like a broken record, but both frac uplift and landing zone.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and Jason, the true answer to that is, this has been a real active week for earnings release amongst our competitors and we're sensitive that you all are living on one hour of sleep and Red Bull, so we decided to keep our prepared remarks short.","Jason S. Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate that and congrats again, guys. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead with your question.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning, and congratulations on the strong quarter. Regarding the Avalon, can it attract a rig to itself in 2017 or does it need to be part of a more regional strategy?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well, this is John. I got a lot of people in Midland who'd love to have a rig on the Avalon and, again, we have certain priorities that we need to meet no matter what. We still have acreage we need to hold in the Wolfcamp, and that will clearly be something we will fund. But I will tell you, this well result has definitely caused us to ask what's next, and I would not be surprised if we go back up on that acreage and push the envelope again in terms of our stimulation design and with a long lateral. That's the one thing I think, next step we'd like to take in the Avalon is get a long lateral under our belt with this type of stimulation and then really see what kind of rate of returns we can achieve. And then probably the next step for us is then spacing. We've already announced before that we did spacing pilots in the past in the Avalon. We feel very good at eight wells per section for an individual interval. And again, there are multiple intervals in the Avalon.","We probably won't (35:48) need to go out there and test tighter spacing, but we're also blessed that we have a lot of competitors in and around our HBP acreage who are doing just that. So, we're not in a vacuum there. So, we'll learn a lot from looking across the fence, but yeah, I think it's safe to say we'll at least get a little bit more capital, at least I'm going to argue for that, for some wells next year to test further within that play next year.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Thank you. That was good color. I'd like to ask a little bit broader question for my follow-up. I was wondering what the Meramec updip versus downdip drilling strategy might be over, say, 2017 and 2018 and to what extent, if any, this might be influenced by the multi-zone potential that you showed on slide 21?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. As far as \u2013 let me just address first updip, downdip. I mean that's a nice little display we put out there, but in no way does that influence where we go with the rig. Right now, honestly, that rig is going to HBP acreage. The two rigs that are remaining the rest of this year, as well as going into next year is earmarked to holding the acreage and some of that acreage is both updip and some of it is downdip. Again, what's nice is we are achieving very good returns in both areas that we want to justify that capital, which is why we're keeping the two rigs. So, I don't know that we make a huge distinction to shift in terms of that, in terms of where we would send the rig because, again, we're trying to hold acreage.","And then \u2013 I'm sorry, what was your second part of that. I'm sorry it was what?","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Well, I guess, really, what I was really thinking is, I mean, sort of thinking simplistically and trying to look at what a greater number of wells over the play as a whole. It seems like the updip tends to be oiler than the downdip, but the Alma pilot is pretty impressive. You got a pretty impressive work out there and I'm wondering if there's any influence from having two zones producing there as opposed to, say, targeting the Meramec kind of theoretically oiler area?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well, all I'll say there is, there is a lot of spacing pilots that are being drilled by us and our competitors. I think at last count, they were 10 of them, I believe. And quite frankly, we have an interest in most of them, so we'll be a avid watcher of those results as well as our own pilot, that we'll be starting completions on here soon. I don't know that we ourselves fully understand the full stack potential of this play, I guess, to use that acronym. We just don't know yet. We feel pretty good where we put our Leon-Gundy that there's enough thickness there to justify the two layers within the Meramec with the one layer in the Woodford and we're very \u2013 we have high expectations for that pilot.","Beyond that, I don't know how much more you can go beyond that and time will tell, and as \u2013 and then you can also argue how will it vary based on maybe that's what you're driving at versus the hydrocarbon component that is, as I get into more oiler window, can I stack more or not or vice versa. Those are things we just don't know yet for this play.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. There is a lot of variables here: updip, downdip, oil, gassy pressure, non-pressure. We will study every well on the trend and I will tell you that we keep a fairly evergreen list where we look at every well and rank them by the rate of return. And we focus on the rate of return. And that's what we're going for. And so, we've talked in the past, we have a bias towards pressure, we have a bias towards deliverability, but our real bias is towards rate of return. And if we were to look at rate of return, this map would be contoured little differently, and we're pretty excited about the potential for us.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Thank you. I appreciate. That's great color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pearce Hammond from Simmons Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Thanks. And Tom, with these very strong well results, do you see this lowering your threshold oil and gas price necessary to move beyond five rigs, if you wanted to add some? So, essentially, if that oil number, say, was $50 as it move down to $45 or likewise on gas, as it move, say, to below $3, just want to get your thoughts around that?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's a great question. And I'll say this, certainly, this is a evolving story and you can go back what we said a quarter ago or two quarters ago and the world's changed just in the last three or six months. Certainly with our performance improvements, our cost reductions, and certainly, LOE reduction is really important part of the story.","Our breakeven cost have come way down and that's through both in Anadarko and in the Delaware Basin. So I will say that Cimarex looks pretty, pretty good in the mid-$40s, $2.50 to $3.00 gas environment. We have tremendous returns throughout our portfolio and we are achieving fully burdened results that are historically high within our program.","So, it's not much \u2013 in answering your question, it's not so much about price as it is stability. We want to manage our balance sheet, we watch our cash flow, and we are absolutely committed to be disciplined and keep the health of this company second to none. And so, what we're looking for isn't necessarily an absolute price signal as it is price stability. And ramping up our capital as we did is probably, to us, a strong vote of confidence on our assets. And we think that if prices were to stable at $45 and the $2.50 to $3.00 gas range, we've got a great landscape ahead of us.","And I've said in the past, we're not waiting for the rescue boat to save us, our challenge to organization was to figure out how to make a living in this environment, and I will say that our organizations respond to that call in every way, both in increased well performance and decreased cost in lease operating. So, we're in pretty good shape if we see stability.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Excellent. Thank you. That's excellent color. And then my follow-up is just to make sure I heard this correctly in the prepared remarks. So, you're targeting 15% growth in oil production from Q2 to Q4 and that's based on your acceleration?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that was my foot in my mouth. Joe said 12% to 17%.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","You're in the middle.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's the midpoint of our range. But Joe, why don't you handle that?","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","Yeah. That is quite simply a byproduct of a CNR, our infill project in the Permian come on here in Q3 and in Q4, as well as the oil that's associated with our Anadarko Basin completions. Now, the real wildcard there is the timing because in late Q3, early Q4, we've got a fair number of wells scheduled to come on and a week or two slip here can really impact those numbers. But the way we forecasted it, we could be anywhere from 12% to 17% higher combined in our total oil production.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Magee from GMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","James Magee - GMP Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone. Congrats on the quarter. I appreciate all the color you've provided on the production differences between the short and long laterals in the stack. And I know it's still fairly early on, but I was wondering if you think there will be any material differences in overall returns between the longer laterals and the deeper overpressure window versus the more shallow regular pressure window? And if you think the longer lateral seem to make sense in both areas?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. I guess I'll take a stab at that. In general, we do believe that incremental capital you spend on a longer lateral is well worth it relative to the rate of return we achieve, and we've demonstrated that throughout our portfolio. But again it's fair to say, the majority of our portfolio is in pressured rock and that's where most of our experience. We do not have a lot of experience in drilling long laterals in lower pressured \u2013 close to normal pressured type rocks.","And something else also happens, we talk a lot about this. Once you move up in that normal pressure part of the play, more oilier play, you're also talking about a part of the play where it's shallower, so your cost to get there, the vertical part of it is very inexpensive. You don't need that extra string of pipe, you drill it very quickly. And a lot of times when we think about long laterals, we love them because it's pretty expensive for us to get there, to get to the target, so once we're there, we want to stay there as long as we can.","In fact, I would argue our drilling department wants to know why we stop at 10,000 feet and, in some ways, internally, we talk about that. But the big difference is when you go updip, it's pretty cheap to get down there, to get to the zone. So, then you got to ask yourself, operationally, does that extra 5,000 feet really gain you a lot or not. And we just don't have a lot of experience with that, I'll be honest with you. All our experience have been in the pressure, but we're watching it very, very carefully ourselves. As Tom said, we're always looking across the fence and asking ourselves maybe, maybe in that shallow where normal pressure, maybe 5,000 feet is a better way to go than 10,000 feet. I don't know that answer right now; we'll see over time.","James Magee - GMP Securities LLC","Perfect. Thanks for the response.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks very much. Congrats on a solid quarter. I guess \u2013 just curious, looking at the 4Q exit, the 4Q \u2013 implied 4Q rate, just thinking about that level as well as the commentary around the oil growth to the fourth quarter. What sort of activity levels would you say are required to keep those levels at least flat, as we look towards 2017? And is your anticipation at this point given the current strip that you would actually still be pressing to grow those levels?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Mark, why don't you handle that.","Mark Burford - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah. Hey, Michael. This is Mark. It's a little early for 2017, put too much guidance around 2017, but as we've now changed our plans and going from three or five rigs, staying at five rigs through the remainder of the second half of 2016. As you go into 2017, the five to seven rigs I would call is a pretty good place, we could be flat to growing slightly into 2017. Again, lots of work still needs to be done. We still need to get comfortable with where the commodities are at and all those kind of caveats, Michael. But five \u2013 we're exiting in a very good pace into 2017, and I think a five- to seven-rig program would keep us flat or grow slightly.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","Yeah. This is Joe. What I might elaborate on there is that our Q4 projection puts us at a pretty high level company-wise going into 2017. So, there's a couple of ways of looking at it. On a year-over-year comparison, certainly what Mark's talking about is doable, but we're going to get these oscillated production profiles with a lot of these infill projects. So, for us, it always, and we talked about this in I think our first quarter call, a lot of these perceptions that your exit rate has a lot to do with what your next year's average is going to be, I think we all need to take a little bit of caution in that because we're going to see highs and lows and highs and lows as some of these big projects come on line.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","One of the challenges we face is we're in a constant inflection point with quality in our assets and also, as Joe said, timing. Truth of the matter is, we're just not that good a forecasters on things that are difficult to forecast and improved well performance is the biggest of them all. But with our asset quality, we had the wind at our backs on that. So, we're pretty optimistic as we look ahead.","Mark Burford - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Great. That's helpful color. I appreciate it. I guess my follow-up, just kind of bigger picture, you have a pretty compelling slide there, I think it was slide 30 or so where you outlined the progression of proppant loading over time. I'm just curious, as we think about a reacceleration of activity from the industry over the coming years, I guess, in theory anyway, if oil prices go up. How would you think about proppant loading as cost inflation comes back into the picture, meaning, is it harder to carry such high proppant loads without the big benefit of cost inflation that we've seen from the cyclical pressure, that make sense?","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","Yeah. This is Joe. I'm not sure I fully understand the question, are you saying as far as availability.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Like, would you not have increased proppant loading to the extent that you have were it not for the cyclical benefit you've gotten from improved pricing from service vendors, such that as things move the opposite way and, theoretically, we expect some inflation down the road, will proppant loading be an area where you would reduced well costs going \u2013 at some point in the future. You know what I'm saying by that?","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","I think so. With regard to well cost, we have been very fortunate that the market has been such that we've been able to increase our job sizes at the same time, that our total overall cost had come down. As an example, if you just look at Q2 versus Q1, in Q2, we prompt about, as a company, 21% more fluid and 12% more sand, yet our per well frac cost was maybe down 10%.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Right.","Joseph R. Albi - Chief Operating Officer, Director & EVP","It all comes down to what John just said earlier, it's going to be a matter of the economics. So, if these prices do creep up or the cost do creep up, we're always going to be looking at for that job, what will it cost, what are the results we expect to achieve pumping that job and does it merit going at the larger job or should we deviate somewhere plus or minus from there in design. So, it's kind of a tough question to answer other than to tell you that we're constantly looking at current cost, we're constantly working hard to keep them low and we're constantly focused on rate of return.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That's a last point I want to jump in on. Joe does a great job of tracking \u2013 just yesterday, we were looking at our total well cost as measured by cents per pound of sand that we're pumping and it's remarkable how far that's come in the last couple of years. But we've got the right lands and I'm very confident we have the right lands and after-tax rate of return. And so, yes, in answer to your question, some of the aggressiveness that we've had in adding to our proppant load certainly has been facilitated by how low our cost structure has been, and if we have pressure either through commodity pricing or service cost, we're going to look at that on a rate of return basis and try to find the optimal solution.","We don't look at production rates and say, the highest production rate is our best solution. We always, always, at Cimarex, look at rate of return on the investment it required. So, I have a lot of confidence in free markets. If market forces cause us to find a different path forward, I think our focus on rate of return is exactly the way to navigate that.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","That's super helpful color. Appreciate it. Congrats, again.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Guffey from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. Mr. Guffey, your line is live. Is it possible your phone is on mute?","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, guys. Sorry about that. Congrats on a good quarter. And for, Tom and John, I guess I'm curious, you guys have drilled a Meramec well in the oil window. In Kingfisher also, you've gone all the way down on the gas window in the southwest portion of the play, and then obviously in between the two extremes. I guess, Tom, based on the running list of operated, non-operating results and then the associated rates of return for all of those wells, what portion of the play do you feel consistently is at the top of the list based on rate of return?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll \u2013 yeah, I'll answer that and then John will jump in. As you look on slide 21, certainly, there is a little area where a lot of stars cluster. It's right about where our pilot project, has the arrow going through. It's near the Alma pilot. It's nearly on Gundy pilot. That is a tremendous little sub-area within the play. Cimarex has some outstanding wells in there, other operators do as well. And that's certainly a really, really attractive part of the play, comparing the play overall.","Now, I will say, if you go up to where we've got our Peterson well, that is emerging as really, really nice part of the play. Similarly, you've seen the Peterson results. I will say, we're very pleased with our acreage position. Our team's done a nice job of building a position up there, so we have really, really nice exposure there. But, John, do you want to comment about the play in general?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Just to follow up what Tom said, early on, that kind of intersection of the three counties there, Kingfisher, Blaine, Canadian. We had a number, as well as our competitors had a number of really good wells. And that area still holds up as a very good area. But without a doubt, this more Western Blaine area, where our Peterson well is, and some of our competitors' wells have recently come on, it's starting to rise right up to the top there. It's an interesting area. And I'm really, really proud of our team, because that's an area where early on in this play, we got out there and grabbed some really good acreage at a really good price. That's really given us that nice yellow position we have there, where the Peterson well is located.","So, that's kind of, in a broad way, where most of the best returns that we see so far. But I don't think this story is done. I think there's still \u2013 I'm fascinated every day another well comes on, and we are surprised. Just the other day, another well came on, an area that we didn't think would be that prospective. And we are quickly looking at it and asking ourself, okay, what's going on there? So, there's a lot of chapters of this story left to play out here in the Meramec for sure.","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for the details. I guess, as a follow-up, since you mentioned it, can you kind of walk through the geologic differences between where that good Peterson well was and the Alma pilot, and what you know today? I understand its evolving, but kind of where you're at today?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","It's just kind of hard to describe. You are in a little bit different geologic setting for the Peterson, where you are with the Alma. You're in a little bit thicker part of the Meramec with the Alma than you are in the Peterson. You're more in a \u2013 what we call, a more updip position. But \u2013 and yet, we are seeing some really good frosty (55:45) development, in and around that Peterson area, which is leading to these really high IP rates we're seeing and leading to the kind of results. So, you may be sacrificing a little bit. I don't see that as a stack, meaning, multi-layer area in Peterson versus say our Leon-Gundy or even Alma area, but you're not as thick. But boy, the rock looks pretty good there though.","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, I guess, Tom in the past, you \u2013 and on this call as well, talked about Meramec variability. I guess, after the two new successful results and a flurry of successful competitor wells, I'm just curious, how has your thoughts evolved on variability across the play? And, I guess, obviously, you have increased confidence with adding a second rig in there. But expectations in terms of variability as you move to different areas of the play, how have those changed and evolved, I guess, since last quarter, and then really since last year?","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, we still see the Meramec as highly variable. Perhaps one of the evolutions is that we think you have a great chance of overcoming that variability with landing zone and proper stimulation. One of the things that, I think, we've learned in the last year is that you cannot settle on a landing zone and carry that six miles or eight miles, and land the well in that same stratigraphic interval and expect comparable results. That said, what we're finding is the Meramec, because it is a series of prograding wedges, if you put yourself in a different wedge and find the right landing zone, you can find that you can overcome that variability.","So, yeah, we still see it as a highly variable play. I think, there were some announcements out of our competitors that suggested that. But we're soldiering on, and we really like it. John, you want to add to that?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah. I think, what it means is, we are getting more comfortable with the variability and how we adapt to it. And then change the recipe, so to speak, in each area. I think, what \u2013 really, in our vernacular, what it means is we will tear it differently. We'll have some areas \u2013 there will be a certain part that we'll look at it from a way we want to drill it and frac it, and other areas will be different.","It's not like our \u2013 I would argue, our Woodford shale, it's a very consistent frac design, we wanted to pull it across all of that shale. It's a very homogeneous interval. That's not true in the Meramec. In the Meramec, you've got to adjust. And I think, over time, we're understanding what's required to get the kind of returns that we like across the breadth of our acreage. And again, the story will continue to evolve. And I am sure, based on what I'm seeing, I think our results will continue to get better, as we get better understanding of this rock, and what's going on here.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I think, it's important, we're speaking for Cimarex here.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yes.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And some of our own style is overprinted on this. I think some of our competitors have spoken about it as being a more uniform play. And we don't mean to contradict that. I just \u2013 they may be talking about different issue than we are. If you're saying it's a play where over broad areas it's developing top-tier economic returns over broad areas, you can drill and get really good results on average, yeah, it's a fairly uniform play.","But I'll contrast the Meramec with the Woodford Shale. The Woodford Shale, we \u2013 fairly early on and particularly with our new stimulations got to a point where we think we understand the regional consistency. We can drill a well anywhere in our asset and fairly, accurately predict the yield. And we're fairly comfortable at a fairly high level making decisions.","When we go to the Meramec, I will tell you that John and I get pretty into the weeds on looking at that stratigraphy, looking at landing zones, talking about completion styles, because it is very variable. And as far into this as we are, it is still, in our opinion, a fascinating and challenging scientific project.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","I agree. We have very stimulating meetings with every Meramec well we drill. And there is \u2013 every Meramec well, in some ways, we \u2013 there is no one template. We \u2013 every one, it's different, and how we landed is different, how we fracked it. And I think that's going to continue for quite a while here until, finally, we settle in, in different areas or tiers as to what's best practice. And I thought we're getting there. And I think that's what you're hearing from us, is that we're getting more confident in how to plan those wells now going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Tom, John, and Mark. Curious, I saw the \u2013 with the rig addition this year, in the past, you guys have kind of outlined goals, and you alluded to that before of how quickly you want to learn some of these things. I guess, one, and this is really kind of a two part question, is the five rigs \u2013 does the five rigs sort of adequately answer what you would like to learn in early 2017, if not, what sort of shortfall is there?","And two, how do you sort of marry that now? I don't see incremental activity going to the Cana just yet, and you do have a premium gas asset now with the strip well above the three into 2017. How do you marry an asset that's ready for full field development with attractive economics now versus trying to find all this knowledge in your other plays?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","This is John. Well, it certainly keeps us busy trying to juggle everything you just described. In regards to Cana, I'm just going to tell you. I'm extremely excited for our future drilling activity in Cana from the standpoint of the kind of returns especially now that we look at it as a long lateral development. And, again, keep that in mind, everything up-to-date in Cana has been 5,000 feet. But given the continuity of our acreage, we along with our AMI partner, Devon, have \u2013 we, together, are starting to have those discussions over long lateral development. And indeed, I think you'll hear from us in the coming quarters start talking more about where that next development will take place for us.","This road we're about to bring on is pretty exciting. It's more liquid rich part of the Cana-Woodford Shale. I'm also excited, because our partner there, Devon, has drilled two-mile laterals, so we'll get a chance to see those in a development phase, how they look. And we have a wonderful position between the two of us, just north of that, that we call the 13-8 area that we definitely see a long lateral development. It's just a question of the two of us coming together at some point and planning that out. And then, we'll see when that starts.","So, you're absolutely right. Cana looks very good, but it's also a matter of how do you get that funded versus everything else that we're trying to answer in the Meramec and in the Wolfcamp and every other play we have.","The other comment I want to make real quick is, we really did a lot early in this year with our spacing pilots. And yes, we don't have a lot to talk about them just yet. But we put a lot of capital early in the year in these pilots, in the Wolfcamp, and in the Meramec. And that's really going to set us up very well for the coming years when we start moving to full-scale development, where we get the kind of confidence to deploy those large amount of capital, say, in the Wolfcamp or in the Meramec, like we are already today for the Woodford. And that's just going to put even more pressure on Tom to open up the first stream and let us spend more money, as we get there.","Thomas E. Jorden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","David, just to add on to what John said, we are really high in the Woodford. And you're right in your observation that wait a minute, what about the Woodford? It's a good question. But part of the way that we are honoring the quality of the Woodford is we need to understand that Meramec, so that when we develop out here, we really exploit this resource in the most prudent fashion. We have to understand how many landing zones we have. We have to understand the full potential of the Meramec.","The thing we absolutely do not want to do is go into Cana-Woodford development, and then find out that the Meramec was left behind. And that if we come in and get it later, we have a real projection interference and disruption. So, part of our aggressiveness in testing the Meramec is to set ourselves up for co-development between the Woodford and the Meramec, and we still have a lot of things to learn. So, we're high on the Woodford, probably higher today than we've ever been.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yes.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Appreciate all the color, guys.","Operator","And our final question for today comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, gents. I had just a couple, very quick questions. But can you give us some more details on the eastern core infill development? I know, it's now going to come online or start fracking in September, how many wells is that, then you could talk a little bit about the completion design around that program?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Well, as I said earlier, it's \u2013 for us, it's 47 gross wells, 22 net wells. And we operate the western-most two sections. We will be coming into it with one frac crew in September. Devon will \u2013 matching up with one frac crew. Very quickly, we'll then have two frac crews to finish up our two sections. And then Devon, I think, has plans to bring in a second frac crew a little bit later in the year, so they can get theirs done , although I think, theirs extends into next year. I'm not sure \u2013 I don't recall, does it Mark?","Mark Burford - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah. I think, it does Joe, yeah.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","I can also tell you that when we look at it, it is definitely more liquid-rich than, say, what we experienced in our previous drill development. In fact I asked the team the other day, when we hit peak production \u2013 the net production we expect off that row at peak will be at about 49% gas, 34% NGLs and 17% oil, so kind of on a gas liquid basis, it's almost a 50-50 split. And so, again, that's why we're very encouraged. We think we're going to get very good returns out of this row.","And then as far as the completion itself, I think, Devon, himself, will speak to their wells, but for our wells, we are moving forward with the design that we deployed on the Armacost section. I think, if you refer to page 30, we talked about that, where we were up at 3,500 pounds per foot. We really, really liked the results from the Armacost. In fact, we don't \u2013 we didn't even talk much about that, but we have a really nice slide showing how Armacost wells are behaving, just as well as our other sections. And yet, we put an additional well within that section, new well. So, we're able to get an extra well, and yet still get similar results, meaning we're more reserves per section, out of that section. So, we feel really good about that frac design, and that's what we intend on using going forward on our two operated sections.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's a great color. And just my final question, obviously, an expanding opportunity set when you think about the Avalon. As you think about you Delaware Basin position, do you have a sense of how much of your acreage could be prospective for the Bone Spring, Avalon, and the Wolfcamp?","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","You mean all three targets?","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Exactly.","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Yeah.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All three targets within the same...","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","Sure.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","(01:08:00)","John Lambuth - Vice President-Exploration","I would tell you that, certainly, all acreage that we allude to on slide 17, as far as the 13,700 net acres of Avalon, have already Bone Spring, in fact, a lot of them already have Bone Spring wells on them that we've drilled in the past, some of them do. And, certainly, have Wolfcamp potential as well \u2013 without a doubt have Wolfcamp potential. And so, that area alone, and in that part of Lee County definitely has all three zones and is not just limited to just three zones. There are multiple zones within each of those, both in the Wolfcamp and the Avalon, and potentially in the Bone Spring. So, it's a very, very target-rich acreage position we have there, that again, if HBP is not going anywhere, and yet we recognize that there's a lot of potential there on that acreage. And again, this latest Avalon well just shows that.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot for your comments.","Thomas E.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Burford, Vice President of Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Burford","Thank you very much, Andrew. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our third quarter conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; John Lambuth, Vice President of Exploration; and also in Denver, we have Paul Korus, our CFO; and Karen Acierno, our Director of Investor Relations.","We did issue our financial operating results, it was released yesterday after market closed. A copy of which can be found on our website. We also posted on our latest investor presentation, which may make some references today on today's call. I need to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business.","We have a lot to cover today, so I'll go ahead and get the call turn over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden","Thank you, Mark, and thanks to all of you for participating in today's conference. We appreciate your interest in Cimarex. A lot has happened since our second quarter call in August, and I'd like to take a few minutes upfront to touch on some of the highlights before turning it over to John and Joe for more detailed update.","Well, despite the impacts with severe weather on the Delaware Basin, which had a significant impact on our third quarter, Cimarex produced a record 942 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which was at the high end of our guidance. And this was a testament to the extraordinary efforts made by our field personnel to safely restore our operations and to a continued strong result in the Mid-Continent region. We had a real mess in our hands with this weather in the Delaware Basin, and I really do want to credit our field personnel for getting after it, performing operations safely and getting our production restored in a clean, environmental way.","When it comes to the Mid-Continent, the Permian, our technical teams have really refocused their efforts to improve the way we complete our wells. In the Cana-Woodford, this is having not only a strong impact in our production, but it's also extending and completely redefining the boundaries of that play. We've got an opportunity set and return profile that really puts us in a nice position, and John will give you some more updates on that.","In the Mid-Continent, we drilled 6 additional Merrimack wells and have completed our initial mapping in Merrimack opportunity. And today, we can tell you that we think we have approximately 70,000 net acres in that fairway, of which 60,000 are held by production. So a really, really nice layer of opportunity added to our assets.","In the Delaware Basin, initial results are in our first downspacing pilot in the Wolfcamp A in the Reeves County. This was a 4-well, 80-acre pilot situated in an area that's ripe with opportunity to drill long laterals. We are very pleased with those results, and I'll leave it to John to go over further details. As we look to the future, however, the opportunity to drill long laterals, 10,000-foot laterals, in the Reeves County, opportunity is really significant to us.","By far the biggest change since August has been a precipitous drop in oil prices. And as you all know, our near month WTI pricing in August was 96 -- $92 on our call August 6. This morning, the 12 months strip is trading around $77, so that's redrawn the landscape as we look ahead.","But I want to take just a minute here and talk about where Cimarex sits in the midst of this very rapidly changing landscape. As we look 2014 in hindsight, some of the things that we did in 2014 have put us in a very, very strong position. First off, we got our bond offering this spring. We placed $750 million, that's 4.375%. We were able to retire all of our bank debt and prepay our Mid-Continent acquisition.","The Mid-Continent asset purchase we announced earlier this year, in hindsight, looks really, really strong to us and is generating some opportunities to have outstanding returns in this price environment, and John will talk about that.","And then the third thing we did this year is we got off some property sales that brought in almost $460 million cash. And as we sit today, we have an extremely strong asset mix. We have good flexibility with our commodity, and we are on pace to end the year with almost $400 million cash on hand. So as we look at this changing environment, Cimarex is sitting exactly where we want to be by design.","I know we're going to get a lot of questions about 2015 CapEx, so I'm going to have [ph] those right upfront. And one thing I'll say is we're going to probably disappoint a lot of you if we're looking for a very refined guidance. We're sailing in to a fog here. There's a lot of things changing. And one thing we can tell you is we don't see a lot of virtue [ph] in giving a lot of guidance in this rapidly changing environment. We are in a very nice position to have the kind of flexibility that we talked about and that we cherish. But we'll tell you as we look into 2015, how we're looking at it.","There's 3 critical elements that really prioritize our viewpoint of 2015. First is what's the robustness of our investment opportunity. In this commodity environment, do we have things that we want to invest in? And to that, I could say absolutely. As we look at the quality of our portfolio, and we want our commodity price down even as low as $60 NYMEX oil and $3 NYMEX gas and hold flat, we have an extremely robust investment opportunity. If we chose to keep our CapEx at a level roughly where it is today, we have plenty to do at that stress test.","Second is what our cash flow going to be and how do we want to preserve our balance sheet? We're still going to have good cash flow in 2015 at these current prices, and we have plenty of balance sheet flexibility.","The third that we'll prioritize how we look at 2015 is the overall market psychology. How deep do we think this trough is going to be and what are other players going to do? Because right now, as we look at what's changed over the last couple of months, we see a decreasing commodity price and yet service costs are still relatively high. And so how we look at 2015 is going to be a function of our opinion of how deep is this trough, and do we think we'll see this service cost reset? So we don't have any answers for you, but I will say we're in a very nice position to be flexible there and adapt as we go.","We also don't have a lot of long-term contracts. As we go into 2015, we'll only have 6 rigs under long-term contract and that gives us a lot of flexibility. So we're not hanging our hands in Cimarex. We're built for this. This is -- these are times that our balance sheet and our capital discipline have really taught us, allow us to seize our opportunities. So we're going to have plenty to do next year, and we'll be -- I'm certainly -- I'm certain, we'll be entertaining a lot of questions on that.","With that, I'll turn it over to John and Joe to discuss details of our progress, and we do look forward to your questions.","John A. Lambuth","Thanks, Tom. I'd like to quickly cover some of the highlights of our overall program before getting into the Permian region. I'll then finish with our Mid-Continent region and some results in Cana.","Cimarex drilled and completed 66 gross, 36 net wells during the quarter investing $460 million. 74% was invested in Permian region, and the rest of it toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. Of those 66 gross wells, 36 gross or 27 net were in the Permian region, where we continue to be focused on the Wolfcamp, Bone Spring, and the Avalon formations in the Delaware Basin.","Bone Spring activity in the second quarter included 12 net wells into Mexico and Texas. We continue to have some of the best -- our best results in the Culberson\/White City area, which is located in southern Eddy County New Mexico and Northern Culberson County, Texas. This geographic area is defined by a fixed hand section that produces more gas in a historical Bone Spring production. We have tested upsize fracs with good results and thus, our drilling program in these areas now incorporates a larger 15 stage frac design. Cimarex has completed 29 wells in the Culberson\/White City area in 2014. Of those, 12 wells have been completed with this new 12 stage frac design, and have a 30-day average IP of approximately 1,150 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 65% or 744 barrels per day is oil.","About half of our 2014 Permian drilling program, or $650 million, will go towards further delineation of our significant Wolfcamp opportunity in the Delaware Basin. This number is down some of our $35 million from our previous estimates due to weather-related delays and our completion program. The $650 million does include downspacing pilots, wells drilled to hold acreage, testing the long laterals and delineation wells designed to help us understand this vast resource.","Our Wolfcamp acreage position now stands at 235,000 net acres. We recently completed a well in Ward County, Texas that is producing from the Wolfcamp B, C zone, bring in the total distinct producing Wolfcamp zones to 7 across the entirety of our acreage.","We continue to test long laterals. Since our last call, 4 additional long laterals have begun producing, bringing the total to 15. Unfortunately, we do not have any 30-day IPs on any of the wells as the heavy rains in the Delaware Basin delayed first production on some wells and the completion of others. I will refer you though to Pages 14 and 15 in our presentation, which provides updated information on the Culberson County long lateral performance to date and economic sensitivities to various realized oil prices.","Lastly in the Delaware Basin, I'd like to give you an update on the status of the spacing pilots we currently have underway. We are now producing from our third spacing pilot an 80-acre downspacing pilot in Reeves County, Texas. The 4 well in this Wolfcamp A pilot had an average 30-day IP of 1,029 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 49% was oil. However, the Cleveland pilot, these wells are located what Cimarex refers to as the Grisham area. The location of this pilot can be seen on page 17 of our presentation. These wells were completed with an upsized frac and compared quite favorably to our predrill expectations. The Cleveland pilot is located in an area that is ideal for long laterals, and we are, in fact, completing a long lateral directly offsetting this pilot right now. We expect this new long lateral well to have an initial production uplift of about 1.7x the Cleveland wells with reserves to come in almost double. This area definitely leads itself to long laterals, and we expect top-tier returns in 4 of those wells.","Our fourth pilot in 2014 is a stacked and staggered pilot in Wolfcamp A in Reeves County, which will test our downspacing and the viability of landing more than one lateral in the fifth Wolfcamp A section. Those wells are literally coming on, as we speak right now.","Now on for the Mid-Continent. We are pleased to report that our ongoing efforts to introduce upsized completions in our Cana program continues to provide good results. In addition to applying the larger frac to development wells, we are also testing the concept on acreage outside the 4 development area, except outside the core area means additional acreage and locations available for development. We are pleased with the results we've had so far.","We have drilled and completed a delineation well we called the Glenda 1-23H, which is located west of our Cana core area and Blank County, Oklahoma. The well was drilled to test the dryer portion of the field and achieved a peak 30-day average IP of 12.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, of which 69% was gas, 27% NGL and 4% oil. I will point out that, that result, and in terms of that IP, is about 2.5x greater than the average IP of the older existing current wells around it. Again, a nice outcome given the application of our new frac design.","I can also report that the heart section, another Cimarex-operated development section completed using upsized frac has achieved a strong result as well, with those 8 development wells having an average 30-day peak IP of 9.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day. This compares very favorably to our previously talked about Golden Section, which had a 10.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day average.","We are gearing up for the development of a 10 section well in the heart of the Cana core area. Cimarex has begun drilling on 2 of these sections, and we anticipate operating as many as 7 rigs at the peak of our drilling activity on this row. Cimarex currently has approximately 128,000 acres identified as available for Woodford drilling, of which 110,000 are held by production.","And then finally, as Tom mentioned, we are now in various stages of drilling and competing 6 additional Merrimack wells since mentioning our first well on our last conference call. Our mapping of this interval, as Tom indicated to you, suggests that we have about 70,000 net acreage perspective for the Merrimack, of which 60,000 is held by production. Plans going forward are to continue to delineate this drilling -- delineation drilling of this potential resource.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph R. Albi","Well, thank you, John, and thank you, all of you, for joining our call today. I'll touch on the usual items, our third quarter production, our fourth quarter and full year production outlook, and then I'll follow-up with a few comments on where we see operating and service cost.","Starting with production. We had another great quarter for production, despite shut-ins of approximately 15 million to 20 million a day for the quarter, as a result of September's severe weather and flooding in the Permian. Our third quarter production came in at 942.4 million a day that put us at the upper end of our projected guidance, which was 920 million to 945 million. It also set a new record for us at the total company production level.","I want to echo a few words right behind Tom with regard to the storms and the severe weather that we saw in September. We are extremely proud of the manner in which our operations teams responded to the rains and flooding that we had in the Permian. The severe flooding impacted the majority of our Triple Crown, our Reeves and our Ward County drilling completion and production operations over a fairly lengthy period, 2 to 3 weeks. Our teams acted quickly and most importantly, safely, to sustain drilling operations, shut-in production, secure facilities, move oil off of our leases, transfer gas markets to other markets, evacuate field personnel from all the exposed area, just a handful of thanks. And as a result, we saw virtually no damage to our facilities, but we did experience the delays we talked about and that's in reestablishing our drilling completion and production operations in effectiveness across the board. The impact wasn't the locations, so to speak. It was more severe row damage that was associated with the floods, and our teams working alongside county officials and more importantly our peer operating companies. We work hard and work together to regain our location access, and we're able to reestablish our operations here by mid-October. So we're very, very proud of our entire team.","Although the storms cut back our production, we saw excellent gains during the quarter. Our total company Q3 volume of 942 million a day, was up a very healthy 104 million a day or 12% from just last quarter and 225 million a day or nearly 1\/3 from where we were a year ago in Q3 '13. With our continued success in Cana, we set new records for all product categories in the Mid-Continent during the quarter with our Q3 Mid-Continent equivalent volume coming in at 518 million a day, that's up 22% from last quarter and 53% from Q3 '13.","Our Q3 Cana volume of 406 million a day was a record as well. It was up 96 million a day or 31% from Q2 and a very respectable 189 million a day or 87% from Q3 '13, nearly doubling our Q3 '13 average of 217 million a day, both very substantial gains. With the increase, Cana now really carries the heartbeat of Cimarex, makes up 78% of our Mid-Continent production and 43% of our total company production.","Despite the storms, we also set new records for all product categories again in the Permian. Our third quarter Permian volume of 408 million a day was up 15 million a day or 4% from Q2 and 56 million a day or 16% from a year ago.","So as we look forward into Q4 with our modeling, we've adjusted the model to really account for 3 significant items: Number one, our Q3 property sales, which took approximately 25 million to 30 million a day off our fourth quarter books, but it also added $454 million to our bank account; secondly, the impact of the storms on our existing production was incorporated into the plan; and thirdly, the storm-related completion delays, primarily in the oil-rich Reeves County area, which in aggregate, moved the number of net completions -- a number of them, 16, from Q4 into 2015. The end result was a Q4 guidance range of 930 million to 955 million which, at first glance, appears flat with Q3 when we adjust for the property sales at 25 million to 39 million a day. We continue to shell quarter-to-quarter consecutive growth on a sale adjusted basis. We did this all the while, we were moving a number of our oil-rich completions into 2015.","So with that, our full year guidance range comes in at 864 million to 870 million. That's a midpoint that remains virtually unchanged from the midpoint we gave you last quarter, despite the property sales and the impacts of the storm. The only significant departure from our previous guidance is our projection for our 2014 average net oil production, which as a result of our Midland Basin property sale and storm-related production and completion deferrals is now projected to range anywhere from 42,200 to 42,500 barrels a day, and that's down from our previous estimate, but still reflecting a very respectable 16% gain as compared to 2013.","Jumping over to OpEx. We continue to keep our LOE in check. Our third quarter lifting cost came in at $1.03 per Mcf. That's down $0.10 from our Q1 and Q2 average of a $1.13 and well below the full year guidance that we issued last call of $1.12 to $1.17. Our guidance speaks really comes as a result of 2 factors: First, our production team's proactive focus on cost control; and secondly, our production growth in the Mid-Continent where we typically see lower per unit cost. All that said, we're still seeing cost pressure and some big items, such as saltwater disposal, rentals and labor to name a few, particularly in the less developed portions of the Permian. And as such, as we look forward with already strong year-to-date numbers on a good number of our liquid-rich Permian wells still projected to come online here in Q4. We've adjusted our full year lifting cost guidance down somewhat to $1.08 to $1.12, and that's down $0.05 from last call.","A few words on service costs. As Tom mentioned, here we go again in the cycle, and we've yet to see the market for top drives to get soft, given the recent drop in price, but -- and as such, you can rig availability is still a little bit tight. But despite that, all other drilling component costs seem to remain in check. Where we have seen cost increases, it has been on the completion side. We continue to feel the effects of cost pressure for service and materials in the frac market, primarily for labor and for prop transportation. But the biggest overall cost increases we've seen are direct result of us pumping bigger jobs, more stages, more volume, more prop. And as a result, our completion cost for our major programs are now making up 2\/3 to 70% of our total well cost. All that said, our well results continue to tell us if these incremental cost are yielding very favorable benefits.","As far as total well costs go, with upsized frac designs now standard in our Cana completions, our current Cana total well costs are falling in the $7.9 million to $8.4 million range. That's up slightly from last quarter and the cost increase is all related to our increase frac design.","In the Permian, with us adopting a larger frac design, now in our Bone Spring program, as John mentioned. Our current AFEs for a 4,500-foot second and third New Mexico Bone Spring well are running in the $6.5 million to $7.5 million range. All that is really depending on depth.","In our shallower White City and the Culberson second Bone Spring program, our AFEs with the larger fracs are running in the $5.9 million to $6.1 million range, while our current Avalon wells are running in the $7.5 million to $7.8 million range.","Lastly, our current AFEs for 4,500-foot lateral Wolfcamp well with the larger frac are in the $8.8 million to $9.3 million, with the 2-mile lateral on the Wolfcamp running to $13 million to $14.2 million.","So as we work our way through the drop in oil prices, we're obviously going to be focused on looking at every avenue to optimize and reduce our total well cost. And we need to do it for operating efficiencies, a continued focus on that. And also by utilizing the service providers who are the most willing to compete in this new low price environment. Ultimately, providing us with the best service at the lower -- at the lowest per unit cost.","So in closing, Q3 was another great quarter for us, despite property sales, the weather impacts during the quarter. Our strong new well adds, good base property performance, added together put us at the upper end of our Q3 guidance and kept our previous full year guidance projection in place that will leave us in check, and we continue to make strides optimizing our completion design with a direct focus on maximizing our well results. So with that, we're on course for a record year here in 2014 and our current strong momentum into '15.","And with that, Andrew, I guess we'll turn the call over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping you can talk about the price that you might plan to budget on for 2015 on a philosophical level, whether you would start with a strip as we getting closer to year end or some discount to the strip. I think, particularly, because you're not hedged. So I want to know how you're thinking about pricing.","Thomas E. Jorden","Drew, this is Tom. Our approach there hasn't changed. We'll look at the strip as sort of our base case, but we're also going to look at downside protection, and we're going to run $60 oil and $3 gas and those are NYMEX pricing. So we will subtract from those downside pricing when it takes to get back to the wellhead and that's going to be true on all of the price files that we quote. We always look at wellhead when we see price. And we're going to make sure that we get a reasonable return at that downside case. So yes, the strip will be our first half, but we're going to really try to be disciplined and make sure that we see a $60 oil, $3 gas environment, we don't destroy capital. So that's a little of both, it's a bit of a polarity because we look at the strip. But if you got something that works at the strip but it couldn't stand what we think is a reasonable downsize stress test, we won't fund it.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's really helpful, Tom. And if we can shift to the Permian. It sounds like, for the most part, operations are back on track. Are there lingering impacts from the flooding? Can you talk about, when you think everything will be fully back to normal in the Permian in terms of completions and general operations?","Joseph R. Albi","Yes. This is Joe. We are back on track. We had a little bit of production that was still impacted about a week or so back, but that looks to be cleared up this week in a little bit. I mean, maybe 5 million a day out of what was a fairly significant volume during the flood. So our completion schedule is intact, roads are accessible, and we're back to normal operation.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I guess a follow-up on that. So the run rate of completions will probably be back to a normal pace for a full quarter by 1Q?","John A. Lambuth","Yes. If you look at the numbers, we basically slid 15, 16 net wells into 2015 and had -- ultimately now Q4 has about in the same number of completions that we've modeled last quarter when we gave our guidance and that will carry -- I suspect, that it will carry itself over into January. This is basically new things, 3 to 4 weeks, because you have to reconfigure your whole frac schedule. You have some pilots involved in all this. We had different interest in different wells and the way it plays out on a well basis is a really just cut into the tail end of September and early October, November, where things are really picking up here from this point forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Gamble of Simmons & Company.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Tom, you touched on the -- touched what I thought was an impressive plan for the Cana, the 10 lateral section, you mentioned the 7 rig peak obviously I'm sure that dovetails in with your discussion of '15 and successful return at various prices. But any more color there as far as the timing to actually have that available to run the 7 rigs, if you wanted to? And maybe even talk about returns vis-\u00e0-vis the new completions and how that may impact decisions to ramp that activity level up in '15?","John A. Lambuth","This is John. I guess, I'll try to answer that for you. We have a plan in place. I'll send our partner to ramp up our rig activity. As I mentioned, we're already at 2 rigs on it. We envision ourselves being upward of 6 to 7 operated rigs. Likewise, our partner will be bringing in rigs, again, at the beginning of the year. When you go to row development, you really got to get a lot of wells drilled way ahead of you before even bring those frac crews in, as you can imagine, especially with 10 sections. And so there will be a lot of drilling going on before you finally get to the point where those frac crews will start showing up some time, probably in the June time frame. And then finally, about a month or so after that you start seeing the production coming in. So we have a pretty aggressive plan for 10 contiguous sections to go forward. And right now I would just say, based on, as Tom mentioned, our stress testing of those wells with different commodity prices, those 10 sections looks very, very attractive to us. So it's -- to us, in a sense, it's full steam ahead on those 10 sections going forward.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And then on the Merrimack, you mentioned, obviously, the one in the last quarter you got 6 in various stages. How many results are we expecting to get potentially by Q4 results?","John A. Lambuth","We will have quite a number of those wells that we can comment on Q4. We just don't have our typical 30-day peak average to talk about on any 1 well. But of those 6, 3 are currently flowing back -- actually 4 are flowing back, 1 ready to frac and 1 is just about done drilling in terms of its lateral. So theoretically, yes, we will probably have more information to talk about those going forward on the next call.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes. This is Tom. We stick to our discipline on that. We really would like to have 30 days of peak production before we discuss wells publicly. And that's just because that's a number that's meaningful to us and our technical teams. And so we actually -- we are close on a well, but we decided now we're going to hold off and make sure that we're consistent with the information and results we communicate.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And Tom, one last one kind of a micro thing. As far as your discussions with other operators and there was some discussion of cost pressures on the completion side, but the rest of your '15 budget came here dependent on kind of how realistic we'll call it, people are with their cost expectations. Have you started having those sorts of conversations? And if so, any color you can lend us to help other people that are looking at '15?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, I -- and I think you all on the call probably know more than we do because you have one-on-one significant engagement conversations with these companies. But I'll say this, we're looking at the landscape of companies that have been greatly outspending cash flow incurring nothing debt to do so, and I said there were 3 elements: One is investment -- the robustness of our investment portfolio; 2, cash flow and balance sheet; and third is market psychology. I think we're curious as to who's going to blink out there. I mean, how deep is this trough, how low could prices go, and there are people wanting to be continuing to incur narrowing debt in order to fund their program. And it's going to take the market laying some rigs down to see service cost reset. Service cost aren't going to respond to the oil and gas price, they're going to respond to demand for services. So -- and I know I'm not answering your question, but we're watching that carefully. And that something that will color our thinking as to how much we want to get aggressive in 2015.","Joseph R. Albi","Yes. And this is Joe, I'll add a little flavor to that. Our operations teams have been in contact with our major service providers over the last 2 to 3 weeks. And they -- the providers are fully aware of the fact that should economics dictate us laying out rigs, we're going to align ourselves up with those that react the quickest and compete in -- this is not a new cycle, we've been here before. Market share will be important to those companies, and we'll align ourselves up with the people who want to react first.","Operator","The next question comes from Cameron Horwitz of U.S. Capital Advisors.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Quick question in the Cana. I know it's a fluid number, but can you give us your best guess for what you think the Cana inventory looks like based on the step-out work that you've done so far to date?","John A. Lambuth","This is John. Well, that's a great question, and I wish I had a number for you right now as I sit here. We still are drilling additional what I'll call re-delineation wells throughout the play. So with each new well, like the one I just announced, it just continues to grow. I'll be honest. It's -- it looks pretty promising for us in terms of that acreage number that I quoted in terms of the total amount of net acreage we have on those perspective. And yes, we still have more wells that we are going to be drilling and testing that will certainly define that. I'll say this much, the Glenda result certainly has given us some encouragement to push that road development further to the west and what we normally would've done. And so again, that got us to the 10 sections we're at right now. And with each new well, yes, we're more and more encouraged with what we see there, with the acreage we currently have. But I don't have a number I could just lay in front of you, like number of locations right now today.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes. This is Tom, Cameron. Just to echo what John said. We're -- re-delineation is a great way to characterize it. We have been continuously surprised and impressed with how this new completion is taking areas that we would have looked at and said it's marginal, maybe submarginal and all of a sudden, it looks really, really robust, and that Glenda is a case in point. And we have lots of areas in the field that we still need to test. Thus far, we're wholly encouraged. I mean, it's just redefining the investment landscape for Cana. So we are really, really optimistic. But we don't have a number for you.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Okay, I guess what goes hand-in-hand with that, can you just remind us where you stand on what you all were thinking about spacing and maybe how that's evolving?","John A. Lambuth","I'm sorry, rephrase -- say the question again? I didn't quite hear you.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Just in terms of the unilateral spacing out there in the Cana, which you all are testing at this point.","John A. Lambuth","Yes. I mean, our typical development peers is 8 new wells in addition to the current well, which will be 9 wells per section. But I can tell you this, that because of these well results and just the metrics we look at in this new well development we're going to that I mentioned, we are going to go to some tighter spacing on subsection. In some cases, upwards of 11 wells on a section.","Thomas E. Jorden","11 new wells.","John A. Lambuth","11 new wells in addition to the parent. And that's just a reflection of the great resource in place we have there. When we truly look at the thickness of that shale, look at the resource and again, we do the different measurements we make, yes, we ask ourselves why not? Why wouldn't it support 11 wells with this frac design? And that, in fact, is what we're going to do on at least 1 section and it will vary by section by section dictated by that resource in place per section.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. I appreciate that color. Just going back to types of Permian. On the Cleveland pilot, is the -- I guess, is the conclusion there that you think optimal development Reeves will be on 80-acre spacing, or is it still too early to tell?","John A. Lambuth","I think the easy answer is too early to tell. I'll simply say this. If we take that result and then take our expectations for a 10,000-foot lateral, which as I mentioned, we're completing one right now, those economics look pretty robust to us in terms if you were to go forward with an 8 well. But in no way does that mean that we know that's the right answer. There'll be more pilots in that area. But suffice to say, we're very encouraged with the results of that pilot and what that means for us going forward with that acreage block we have there.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess just last for me just so I'm clear. In terms of the oil trajectory out of the Permian. If you took the noise out from the completion slippage and the shut-ins, do you all -- would you have cleared that 40,000 barrels a day that you all had talked about in Q1 and the Q4 period?","Mark Burford","Well, you can start counting to 40,000 barrels per day, and this is Mark. In the Permian, Cameron, what are you referring to?","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Yes in the Permian, I think in Q1, you had put out a 40,000-barrel a day number for Q4. I'm just trying to understand. Taking the noise out, where you on that trajectory?","Mark Burford","Yes. I mean, Cameron, taking the noise are meaningful, trying to put back the wells when they would have been completed when we thought they would be completed, plus take the storm downtime out. Yes, that's it. It would be on that trajectory. But we have 2 moving pieces there, we both had wells on production that didn't produce, like we thought they would because of storm down fund. Hopefully, shifting about 15 wells from this period to next. So if you put everything back, we had a construction which we could achieve, or x the storm I think we would have hit those numbers.","Thomas E. Jorden","Property sales that....","Mark Burford","Same property sales are on top, which we didn't have to opt into the number. Now whatever is -- the minimum base in Wolfcamp which we did sell, it was about 1,500 barrels a day in the fourth quarter that we didn't sell so. That we had to open into our numbers. There was no element in our numbers that we removed out post of sale.","John A. Lambuth","That's a big piece of it.","Operator","The next question comes from Joseph Allman of JPMorgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Tom, it sounds as if you already are in the process of ramping up, especially in the Cana. And so, is that correct that just in terms of planning and getting ready to add additional rigs, you're already there? Or are you are you already in the -- or are you tapping the brakes already to sort of waiting and seeing how this oil market plays out? And if...","Thomas E. Jorden","Well -- go ahead.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, go ahead, Tom, I'll follow-up later.","Thomas E. Jorden","No. That's -- you're absolutely right. We have committed to do this additional development row in Cana, and we're bringing some rigs in to prosecute that and that's steady as she goes. We think that project really can stand tall in this commodity-priced environment. Not only standing alone, but compares favorably our investment landscape. Additional delineation we're doing in the Merrimack, we think is really something that we want to continue to do. And then as we look at the Permian, we look at Culberson County and the joint development agreement we have when we look at really that whole fairway that's in our corporate update. So we kind of think of Culberson County and then up to that White City block in Eddy County as one geologic province. We're going to do as much of that as we can with long laterals where we can. Those stand tall. And then the rest of it is a jump ball. I mean, quite -- everything else, either in the Mid-Continent Permian, is up for discussion. Now I will say that I think you're going to see a higher percentage of our capital be going to the Anadarko Basin next year than this year. This year with 75% Permian. You'll probably see a little higher percentage in Anadarko. A little higher, I don't think it will be half, but we're working our way through it. I mean, the good news is we're really testing this on a rate-of-return metric. We're not testing it on what our preferred commodity type is. We're looking at which of our opportunities have the robustness to the downside of commodity, and we have lots and lots to do.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's helpful. Tom, and just a follow-up on that, so how much are you willing to outspend cash flow in 2015? And what metrics would you be looking at to judge a comfort level with outspend?","Thomas E. Jorden","That's -- Joe, I can't answer that today. I mean it's that -- I said there are 3 elements, the third is market psychology and that's the most touchy-feeling of all 3. I can drill a lot into that. And then we want to see where do we think this oil price is heading? Where do we think service costs are heading? What do we think will be the duration and depth of this correction, if you will? And make that -- we'll have to make that decision today, and there will be -- it will be really clueless to do that today and talk about it. There's one thing to talk about cash flow next year. We also are going to exit the year with a lot of cash on hand. I mean, we think we're up, really cash flow plus about $400 million cash on hand. So that's all available to us before we have to borrow $0.01 next year. So there -- we have a lot of flexibility.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's helpful. Tom, and just an operations question. So in terms of the completion designs and the changes you're making, what can we look forward to as some of the kind of most interesting things you're trying and where, in particular?","John A. Lambuth","Well, this is John. Well, I was allowed to say this much. In as much as we really, really like the type of returns and the performance we're seeing sales, those Cana wells, likewise, what we're seeing now is the Bone Spring wells, I mentioned. We have a lot around here where we're not satisfied. And yes, we are constantly challenging ourselves how could -- what could we do better with the completion design. And so there are more things that we're going to test whether it's stages, whether it's the maker of the proppant, but I'm not going to sit here and just tell you what our recipe is to that degree. I'll say that we're not satisfied always we were at and always want to try to push that envelopes to make sure could we get more out of that lock and that's pretty much our go forward model in a sense -- in exploration right now.","Thomas E. Jorden","This is Tom. We have a lot of mysteries in our stimulations here today, a lot of technical challenges and that's a good thing. There's a lot of upside. Now do we have our upside equal to what we've seen? Obviously, we've taken bold steps. We don't know. But I will say this, if I were to tell you that we understood every element of this, that would be dampening, because I would say that we don't have additional upside. We have a lot of mysteries yet and we have a lot of really smart people really working at making this better.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Robertson of Barclays.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. But just from a philosophical standpoint, I guess it sounds like you all planned to enter 2015 with some flexibility around your capital program to see where cost go and maybe also, if you have a prolonged period of lower prices to see what other opportunities may come up on the acquisition front, is that fair?","Thomas E. Jorden","That's absolutely the case, Jeff. And one of the things that I'll say, we don't wish for corrections but, boy, we all kind of leaned forward. We're trained for this. This is in our DNA, and our history is that in these down cycles, there is tremendous opportunity. And we'll be as opportunistic as we possibly can. We're going to stay flexible. You're probably going to -- we'll talk about wide ranges in what we're continuing to do and we won't apologize if we have to accelerate or decelerate. We're going to be as opportunistic as we possibly can.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And secondly, Tom, have you all talked much with -- as you're playing your 2015 capital program, have you talked much with the service providers about cost directions and especially in areas where you know you're going to be busy? Are there -- are they -- have you shown any willingness yet to make any concessions or help you all out on prices?","Joseph R. Albi","Yes, this is Joe again. I'll just react on what I mentioned a bit ago. We have had initial discussions with our larger service providers. They are aware of our position. They're aware of the market. They're finding some of the same things we are. They've got cost that they're incurring that even as early as September, we saw rate increases on the drilling side, primarily on the labor side. It's going to have to be a trickle-down effect, but I will tell you this, and Tom hit it right on the head. Once rigs start laying down, then it's a scramble for market share. And once it's a scramble for market share, we're in a pretty good position because we will be active, and we will be a viable customer. So it's going to have to trickle down, and we're got to keep the heat on them.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Then lastly, you all have not built any expectations of lower cost into some of the returns you're talking about yet have you?","John A. Lambuth","No. This is John. Any of our go forward economics, we absolutely do not build in price reductions into our capital cost. We assume the cost is what it is today, and we base our decision on that today. If cost come down, then we will adjust at that appropriate time. But no, nothing built in on our go forward modeling for future well returns.","Operator","The next question comes from Irene Haas of Wunderlich Securities.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","So 2 questions. Firstly is at what level would you -- what's your maintenance CapEx, i.e., what's the minimum amount that you could spend to keep your production flat? And secondarily, for the Merrimack, the wells you have drilled that straw how variable are the pace? Are they kind of the same location where you expect or are they more scattered?","Mark Burford","Yes, Irene, this is Mark. On your first part of your question there with the seen as capital required to invest to order production. Honestly, it's on the measure we spend really any time evaluating that is, we still bottoms up and look what are the things we'll invest in the period. And then based on a rate of return, and we see the outcome of the production is. We don't use a lot of sensitivities on that. I don't have a hard number for you. I mean, honestly, what that would represent at this point. Obviously the mix of what we drill, timing of what we drill. Even as John touched on like with Cana really for development, there's this amount of capital being incurred in the first half of the year that we won't see production until second half, this is all a variability timing, often this is development that always -- it just compares to some of our logical thinking too, because timing and year-over-year comparisons are neat, but clearly, we had return in the cash flow, which generate all the investments we're making, that's what we focus on.","John A. Lambuth","And this is John. In terms of your question on the Merrimack. Of the 6 wells, they are very diverse in their geographic location, as well as in their geologic intervals that they're testing. I mean, they are truly delineating our acreage position, such that with those results in hand, we'll have a much better feel for just what's the breadth and scope of this opportunity. And so far, I would just say, \"I'll just going to make another comment.\" We're obviously not alone here. In the Merrimack, there are lots of other wells being drilled by other operators. And so far, and I guess you could -- you can kind of draw that conclusion by the fact we have 6 wells now and plan to -- probably plan to drill more, we do like what we see here so far. But again, we need those well results in hand to figure out just what the overall size of the price is right now.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Is it fair to say that this is probably more complicated than the Cana-Woodford play?","John A. Lambuth","In terms of how we see right now, yes. It is a play that we are quickly coming up to speed and in terms of our understanding of the rock, the whole core we take, the analysis of that core, the logs, we're really at the intimacy here of just understanding the nature of this play. And so it will all take us some a while here to get more and more comfortable with. But again, so far, we like what we see.","Thomas E. Jorden","Also Irene, this is Tom. The play like Cana-Woodford has a lot of geological variation. It varies in thickness. And one of the things it varies is in hydrocarbon-type and also pressure. And so the window we're playing it in is a little different than where a lot of the announced activities has been. And so a lot of -- we as you know, you know as well, we study our competition and it's not always a direct analog to where we're playing at. But as John said, we're very, very encouraged about what we're seeing thus far.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the Cana again. Can you just remind us on infrastructure and availability of labor? I'm just trying to figure out is there any limitations to -- if we look at this differently to potentially going beyond the plan that you've laid out in this call.","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe. We don't see that to be an issue as far as personnel to get the job done and get the wells drilled. Services are there. We're proactively working with the -- our processing entity for market, for capacity and for market availability for residue gas sales and NGLs. And so we're about 6, 9 months ahead of that, and don't foresee issues there, but everything looks like it's on track.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And on the 7 rigs that you guys mentioned, I mean is that -- that's just Cana, right? So are there other rigs that you guys are planning to allocate to the Mid-Con?","John A. Lambuth","Yes. This is John. Yes, there will be some additional rigs drilling. As Tom mentioned, for sure, some additional Merrimack delineation, as well as other concepts and things that we're pursuing. I don't have an exact number for you today. Obviously, that's depending upon where we think we're going to fund and what level next year. But above and beyond the 6 to 7 rigs on that row development, there will be other rigs active for us in the Anadarko region.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And maybe just a similar question, but taking it to the Permian. Can you maybe just update us on where things stand on oil gathering and gas processing for you guys over there?","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe. We're right on track with our plans. We continue to put pipe in the ground, both in Triple Crown as well as in the Reeves County area. We've locked in to some firm volumes with 2 or 3 additional processors since our last call. We're aware of their capacity. At the same time, there's somewhere around several bcf a day of new processing coming on in the next 2 years. So Triple Crown's working out as exactly as we'd hoped. We got to take away to the North, take away in the middle, take away to the South. And so far so good, but again, just like Cana, we got to stay out ahead of this. With the drilling activity is going to look like and then try and react in proactive manner rather than after we drilled the wells to ensure capacity take away.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And on the oil side, Joe?","Joseph R. Albi","On the oil side, things are blowing and going. We're not having any issues hauling. We continue to be in discussions both in Triple Crown as well now in a new -- in 2 other areas, the Reeves County and Lee County area for oil gathering projects, both of those were working towards inking agreements and are in the process right away for oil gathering, which has really take a lot of pressure of this by the end of next year.","Operator","The next question comes from Ipsit Mohanty of GMP Securities.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities L.P., Research Division","Just a couple of broad questions. The delivery basin as good as anyone else. When you look at various traffic scenarios in '15, do you look at your development at the basin equally across the 8 stage? Or would there be areas that you would rather focus and then some that you have not touched? And then as -- and in relation to that, would there be particular zones that you're going to first? Or would you just develop the way that you're doing right now? I'm just curious to see how you look at developing that portfolio, let's say, if oil goes down even further.","John A. Lambuth","This is John, I guess, I'll try to answer your question first. You're absolutely right in that, but our basin is a very broad, large basin. And within that basin itself, we see lots of variability in terms of the type of hydrocarbons we make. As we spoke about many times, say for instance, in Wolfcamp, we have the breadth of acreage where we could be anywhere from being almost mostly oil in the reservoir to all the way up in Culberson, where it's predominantly gas with a really good yield component to it. And in some ways, commodity price dictates where we go with that. Right now, as -- again we've talked about Culberson looks still extremely attractive to us from a rate of return standpoint. On the flip side, I will tell you right now, Ward County, Wolfcamp gets a little bit of a struggle right now, given the current prices with oil. And just given the depth we have to drill to and to the lack of pressure, I would say, within that reservoir, Ward is a little bit of a struggle. But the nice thing is that we have this large acreage position that we can move those rigs to, again, maximize our returns throughout that basin. That's no different than also in the Avalon. Right now, we haven't really talked about it, but we have quite a few Avalon wells that would be coming on in the next quarter. And again, we're targeting that area, the Avalon, where the product mix is such that we feel like we hit our best returns out of that basin. So we have a lot of flexibility within that basin, as the way I would put it.","Joseph R. Albi","Yes, I might add to that. It's not just a function of commodity price, it's also a function of technology. And our thinking on the various sweets spots has changed over time, and they will change again. So we're continuing to work it and adapting as we go.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities L.P., Research Division","Was that - and then in that case, let me scratch in looking deeper and see that in terms of -- assuming that all your drilling from your own will be on upsized fracs, how do you see the extended lateral program developing? So in terms of -- for example, going forward, I know it's dictated a large by lease geometry, I understand. But then as you look at spending that incremental capital going forward, how do you see -- what's the extent of extended laterals that you'd be drilling across your region?","John A. Lambuth","This is John. I will tell you anywhere, quite frankly, that our acreage allows us to do it. Our main goal is to ultimately make it an extended lateral play. Because as you mentioned, that incremental capital to drill that extra 5,000 feet is more than offset by the type of returns we get out of that well from the hydrocarbons that we flow out of it. So that's why areas like Culberson, the JDA, it's so valuable to us because that JDA gives the large continuous operated acreage position that allows us to do that. In fact, that this our go forward plans in terms of Culberson is long laterals. Unfortunately, I wish in all years we had acreage that we could do that everywhere. But again, where the acreage allows us to do it, that is, ultimately, our plan and goal on a go-forward basis, especially when we think about it from a development standpoint.","Thomas E. Jorden","And that will also be true in Cana. We have scenarios with Woodford where we think we have long lateral development to do. And as we look at the Merrimack, I think that we're going to be looking long and hard at long laterals.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities L.P., Research Division","Did you have any longer lateral drilled in the Cana in the third quarter? Maybe in...","John A. Lambuth","No, no long laterals in the third quarter. The only long lateral is the one we've talked about in our last earnings release. Again, as I mentioned earlier, in this mode of delineation, of undelineating are not going to do it with long laterals. I'm going to do with 5,000-foot laterals, as I tried to establish economics. I will say again, we have future plans of development in Cana, nothing written down just yet, but we clearly have a large acreage position that would lend itself very nicely to 10,000-foot development in the Cana-Woodford shale for future drilling.","Thomas E. Jorden","And Page 20 of our presentation highlights that 10,000-foot lateral in the Woodford.","Operator","And due to time constraints, the last question today will come from Dan Guffey of Stifel.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","You guys have been very clear in the past that you're focused on not leaving PV behind by entering development mode too quickly in the Permian. So looking at Culberson, I wonder if you can remind me approximately how many Wolfcamp A wells have you drilled? And then also provide some color on kind of a Wolfcamp A performance first, the B bench, and then also give a little color on your pilot between the C and D stacked lateral and really kind of how you're thinking of development on a long-term basis going forward in Culberson White City.","John A. Lambuth","This is John. In terms of the Wolfcamp A, we have reported on a couple of them so far. We have a few more that are coming on. Again, they look very attractive to us relative to the Wolfcamp D interval that we mentioned before. In terms of build-forward development plans, on our previous release, we talked about the results of our 8 well spacing pilots. I will tell you that we already have in the works our next pilot which, tentatively, we start drilling on sometime in the December time frame. I think it's fair to say that we're still internally debating what is the right thing to do with that pilot to further understand and ensure that, like you just said, that we come up with the right plan, so we do not leave any PD behind. But that's where we're at right now. We have both a pilot and the works and for later this year, and we have still some more drilling that we have to do in terms of holding an acreage and still testing for the balance of that Wolfcamp Shale play for us in Culberson. I hope that answered your question. If there's a follow-up, let me know.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","No, I appreciate the color. I guess, you guys have additional data from the outside frac in Cana and throughout the Wolfcamp and throughout Delaware. I guess, when do you guys feel it's appropriate to put out a detailed cut-type curve in EUR estimates by player area. I mean, obviously, you guys are modeling internally, giving some of the guidance you have in terms of the long lateral and upsized at EUR. Just wondering when you guys think it may be appropriate to publish some of those EUR estimates?","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, this is Tom. When we have results that we think are meaningful. And so I know that there's some pressure for us that talk about wells early, but I just want to say again, we're a company built on ideas, technology and innovation, and we really focus on the science and get a good meaningful data. And we don't want to get ahead of ourselves and we want our investors to -- our credibility in our communication. And so that will occasionally mean, we're going to be able to slow and release data once it's in the solid results category and not in the promise or hope category. And so we'll release that as we have it. We have a lot a wells that are currently flowing back. So I think, certainly next quarter, we will have much data to release, and we'll release the data we have. Now as far as EURs, we typically don't talk a lot about EURs, but we'll certainly show you our type curve and what it means to us.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

My name is Leshanna [ph] , and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Cimarex Energy's Third Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Burford. Sir, you may begin.","Mark Burford","Thank you very much, Leshanna [ph] , and welcome, everyone. Thanks for joining us today on our third quarter conference call. And for those of you on the East Coast affected by super storm Sandy, we sincerely hope things get back to normal for you, and that we really appreciate you also taking the time to join us today.","Here, in Denver on today's call, we have Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; Paul Korus, Senior Vice President and CFO; Bill [indiscernible], Vice President of Exploration and Jim Shonsey, Vice President and Controller.","We did issue our financial and operating results news release this morning, a copy of which can be found in our website. I need to remind you that today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases for the risk factors associated with our business.","So with that, I'll go ahead and just turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden","Thanks, Mark, and welcome, everyone. I do want to echo Mark's remarks for those of you living on the East Coast, certainly, our hearts go out to you with everything you're fighting and appreciate you joining us this morning.","We had a solid third quarter, reporting net income of $84.3 million or $0.97 per diluted share. Our adjusted cash flow from operations this quarter was $291 million, down from $357 million last year third quarter, but up from the $240 million in the second quarter of this year. And as those of you that have read our release, this release is all about execution.","We're pleased, very pleased with our organization, with the way it's developing the promised results. We have a number of very exciting things going on. But just as a preamble, we're very pleased and proud to deliver the results we promised, and we think that will be an ongoing story from Cimarex.","Our third quarter 2012 production volumes averaged 635 million cubic feet equivalent per day. That's up 7% from year ago of 592 million cubic feet equivalent per day. And it's up 8% sequentially from the second quarter. We're seeing strong growth in the Permian and Mid-Continent, which had a combined average 599 million cubic feet equivalent per day, and that's 18% over last year.","That growth includes a 42% increase in our Permian Basin oil volumes, which averaged 25,000 barrels of oil per day this quarter, so very, very nice Permian and Mid-Continent results.","Our total company oil production grew 23% to 32,456 barrels per day. Liquids accounted for 49% of our equivalent volumes and 79% of our $397 million of oil, gas and NGL revenue.  So we're seeing an increasing liquids component to our overall production stream.","Gas prices were lower this quarter compared to last year. Realized gas prices averaged $2.79 per Mcf this quarter, and that's 39% lower as compared to the third quarter 2011 price of $4.57 per Mcf. sequentially, for the second quarter, gas price improved by 15% from second quarter 2000 [sic](2012) price of $2.42 per Mcf. We've all been encouraged and heartened by the recent uptick in natural gas prices.","Realized natural gas liquids prices were flat Q2 to Q3 at $28.29 per barrel but were down 34% as compared to the third quarter of 2011 price of $43.11 per barrel. And realized oil prices were flat, around $87 to $88 per barrel from this quarter, last year third quarter and the second quarter.","In the first 9 months of this year, we've drilled 253 gross, 138 net wells, investing $1.2 billion on exploration and development. Of total expenditures, 52% were invested in projects in the Permian Basin, 44% in the Mid-Continent and 4% in the Gulf Coast and other.","Now, I'd like to give you a region-by-region breakdown. Of course, our regions are the Mid-Continent, which would be Cana, Woodford Shale, Gulf Coast and Permian Basin. And I'll start with the Mid-Continent and save Permian Basin for last.","So moving on to the Mid-Continent. In the first 9 months of 2012, we drilled and completed 119 gross and 49 net Mid-Continent wells. Our year-to-date Mid-Continent exploration development capital has totaled $530 million or about 44% of our total exploration development capital.","Most of this year's Mid-Continent drilling activities has been in the Cana-Woodford shale play. Year-to-date, we've drilled and completed 113 gross or 47 net Cana wells. At quarter end, we had 54 gross, 24 net Cana wells waiting on completion. This compares with a total of 13 gross or 4.9 net wells waiting on completion at year end 2011.  So the increase in wells awaiting completion is the result of commencing our infill development drilling in 2012.","Our operated Cana drilling infill has been along 7 east-west sections or along 7 miles in the core. Along this 7 section row, our infill drilling and completion activity has been progressing from the Eastern, liquids-rich side towards the West, drier side. We started our frac-ing on May 23. Our flowback began in late June and the first sales were in mid-July.","Our overall production volumes have exceeded our risk wedge and we're on target. We are always fascinated by Cana. Cana continues to be one of our most detailed science projects. We continually analyze the data. We're looking to see how we can optimize it and try to explain and improve.","One of the things I will say that we've seen this year, year-to-date is some of our early flowback wells are below our type curve. And that's been something we've been working on diligently. Overall, we've been exceeding our risk guidance and our risk production wedge, where we think we can do it a little better.","Our infill wells have flowed back at a little lower rate, but they're delivering higher oil yields and flatter decline. So we've been digging into that problem. We think we have it solved. We've tweaked our completions. We think we can actually remediate and improve our existing wells. But as always, just when you think you're in a production mode, you'd still have a lot of science to do. So Cana continues to be a great project. It's delivered our promised volumes and we're very optimistic going forward.","We've been talking about bringing our Cana rig count possibly to 0. We're tempering that, we're going to exit the year with 4 operated rigs in Cana. We're still seeing very good returns in Cana. We're seeing our cost come down, and we'd like to keep those 4 rigs running and that would give us a little optionality to gas prices.","We'd like to get into the winter. And before we drop our Cana fleet, just see how gas prices stabilize. So we'll exit the year and be at least into early February with 4 operated rigs in Cana.","And now the Mid-Continent, we've got a couple of rigs working in some oilier Anadarko Basin targets. They're new concepts that we're testing. And we're hopeful these could be, all these and even say significant incremental investments for 2013 if they work out as planned, but it's too early to discuss any of those results.","Moving on to the Gulf Coast. In the Gulf Coast, we began prospecting on some recently shot 3D, so now we have some new data, we're back to prospecting. We're currently building our inventory. We don't have any granularity to discuss on that. We'll have a definitive look soon, but we expect to be drilling some of our new prospects in 2013.","Moving on to the Permian. At Permian, the Permian, we drilled and completed 131 gross or 88 net Permian wells during the first 9 months of 2012. We completed 96% of those as producers. At quarter end, we had 18 gross or 11 net wells waiting on completion, and our year-to-date Permian exploration development capital has totaled $631 million or 52% of our total exploration development capital.","Very, very active Permian program and our team, both exploration and operations, marketing, they're working together, firing in all cylinders and really getting after it, very proud of the results we're posting in the Permian. Our most active Permian drilling program is our New Mexico second Bone Spring horizontal oil play. This year, we've drilled and completed 48 gross, 24 net New Mexico Bone Spring wells, and we're continuing to see excellent, excellent results in this program.","The per well 30-day gross production for the New Mexico Bone Spring wells drilled this year has averaged over 630 barrels equivalent per day. That's 30-day average, and of that, 86% is oil. The team has done a great job in this program maximizing well performance, stepping out into new areas and I'll add, also being opportunistic in capturing additional opportunity.","Moving on to the Texas Third Bone Spring, we drilled this year 28 gross, 18 net wells so far. We're in an outstanding area, bringing on really strong wells. The wells we've drilled this year have had per well 30-day average production rates in excess of 1,000 barrels equivalent per day, 80% of which is oil. And that was our 30-day average, it's not instantaneous rates. A couple of our wells had 30-day rates in excess of 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is a great program, and our team is doing a great job.","Finally, in the Permian, I'd like to discuss and give you a little update on our Wolfcamp program in the Delaware Basin. We're seeing very solid results from our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp drilling. We've primarily focused our drilling in Southern Eddy County, New Mexico and Northern Culberson County. We have increased our leasehold in this area, something we haven't discussed before. We had the opportunity to pick up an additional 28,000 acres in the heart of our play. That was a $21 million purchase. And that brought our overall position to over 100,000 net acres in the area we're currently developing.","Now we have an additional 32,000 acres that could be extensional. There've been some additional activity in Reeves County that sets us up. We're testing the Wolfcamp and the Reeves County, and that would be directly additive to that position.  So we're very, very bullish on this play and when they're finished, I think you'll see why.","This year, we've drilled and completed 11 gross, 10 net Horizontal Wolfcamp wells, bringing our total wells in the play to 29 gross, 27 net wells. So very high working interest. Our per-well first 30-day production rates on all wells drilled to date have averaged 6.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day or over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The equivalent production is comprised of 2.8 million cubic feet a day of gas, 275 barrels per day of oil and 330 barrels per day of NGLs. So assuming full NGL recovery, that's 43% gas, 26% oil, 31% natural gas liquids.","So this play certainly is susceptible to all 3 of our commodity pricing, gas, oil and natural gas liquids. But at current strip pricing, we're seeing very, very nice returns in this play. We're also seeing our costs come down. We've talked about wells costing $8 million to $8.5 million. Our most recent costs there are $7.6 million and moving downward.","We're very excited to be adding this additional acreage to our position, not only as the Wolfcamp perspective, but our current viewpoint in this position is that it more than likely will become a multi-pay zone, multiple objections, like so much of the Delaware Basin.","But first, starting with the Wolfcamp and I'll move on to other potential, of our 100,000 acres, if we said 80,000 of it would be developed for the Wolfcamp and we think based on our current viewpoint, that's a reasonable statement. At 160 acres per location, at $7.6 million a well, that project would generate, just the Wolfcamp, $3.8 billion of future investment potential, net to Cimarex.","If we were to go to 80-acre spacing in the Wolfcamp, and although we haven't tested it yet, we're early time. We don't have a pilot project yet, I think most of us would be surprised if it weren't 80-acre development, that would be $7.6 billion net to Cimarex of future development.","And then we add to that other locations. The Second Bone Spring is prospective over much of that acreage. We've recently had some offset wells being drilled in the Second Bone Spring that had very, very nice first 30-day oil rates. We're completing our first Second Bone Spring well here imminently, in fact, we'll be on it Monday. We have a second drilling with encouraging results. And based on shows in some offset wells, we're very optimistic. Our current position, we'd have at least 125 Second Bone Spring wells. And on top of that, we have the Delaware, a third zone that's yet to be tested. It does produce in the area, and we've had excellent shows.","So we like Culberson County. It's a nice add to our Permian program. It has capital investment in and of itself, sufficient to keep our Permian program alive at our current rate for many years to come.  So we're very encouraged by that.","Overall, I'd just finish the Permian by saying our Permian program is doing very well. I think that was obvious from the numbers we posted this morning. We have a huge inventory in future drilling and an extremely talented exploration and operations team. And that last point is really the main one. Our program is homegrown. We didn't buy it, we generated it and built it. And our team is the one that makes that happen, and we're very, very proud of what they've been doing.","So in conclusion, as we look at our results to date, it's been a solid year so far. We're focused on execution. We're on track to deliver the guidance we promised. And I want to reiterate that we're proud of the operation and overall performance of our organization.","We're still pouring over our 2013 plans. We don't have any particular detail yet. I will say that we're opportunity rich. We have some great projects, with good returns. In 2011, we invested $1.58 billion. This year, we expect our capital to be similar, at about $1.6 billion. Both years we're a fair bit ahead of our cash flow. Last year, in 2011, most of the shortfall was funded by the Riley Ridge property sale. This year, we funded most of the shortfall with debt, which has increased $400 million to $500 million. That certainly hasn't impaired our balance sheet. We've put that capital to use on great array of return projects. And we think it served our shareholders.","For 2013, we're planning on decreasing the amount of capital funded by debt. I would expect that we would limit our borrowings next year to no more than $100 million to $200 million. We're looking and discussing the potential sale of some noncore mature long lived oil production in areas that we're not currently investing and which we don't see drilling and exploration upside.","This wouldn't be a material amount of production. Again it's, at this point, conversational. Probably something less than 3,000 barrels a day. But we can put those proceeds to work on a drilling program, chasing much stronger returns.","So very nice quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","Joseph R. Albi","Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all of you for joining our call today, especially those of you, as both Tom and Mark mentioned, back East and the situation back there.","I'll be touching on our third quarter production, update you on our fourth quarter guidance projections and then follow-up with a few words on our operating and service costs.","Starting with our Q3 production, our third quarter volumes came in, as stated in our press release, at 635.1 million a day. That's above the midpoint of our guidance of 610 million to 640 million a day, up 7% from our Q3 '11 average of 592 million a day. And it set for us a new high mark as far as equivalent production for the company.","The big driver to our growth was our increased oil production, which grew 23% over Q3 '11 to a record 32,456 barrels per day. As compared to Q2, during Q3, we saw less downtime associated with plant facility shut-ins or maintenance, as we had in the previous 2 quarters. During Q3, we saw approximately 4 million to 6 million a day of downtime versus the 14 million to 16 million a day that we saw in Q2. We did see some ethane rejection, particularly in Cana during July and August, which impacted our Q3 volumes by approximately 4 million a day for the quarter.","But beginning in September, we saw the ethane recovery pick back up, and given current market conditions, we do not anticipate further ethane rejection for the remainder of the year.","This was a quarter of records for us. With us setting 19 new internal benchmark records. At the total company level, we set new high marks for equivalent, oil, NGL and total liquid production. In both Cana and the Mid-Continent, we set record marks for all product categories, gas, oil, NGL, total liquids and equivalent volumes. And in the Permian, we set new high marks for all production categories but gas. And when the dust settled, our total company Q3 liquid production mix came in at a record of 49% liquids.  All of this pointing towards a strong evidence of our focus on an oil and liquids rich gas activities in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent.","If we dig a little bit deeper into the details, our Q3 '12 Permian net equivalent volume of 274 million a day was up 11% or 27 million a day from Q2 '12. And 33% or 68 million a day from Q3 '11. Oil growth was the real driver here, with our Q3 Permian oil coming in at, as Tom mentioned, 25,000 barrels of oil per day. That's up 15% from Q2 and a very healthy 42% from Q3 of last year.","We're drilling some excellent wells in the Permian, and it's showing up in our numbers, with strong production adds from our Texas and New Mexico Bone Spring wells, as well as our Wolfcamp program.","In the Mid-Continent, our record equivalent volume this quarter of 324 million a day was up 8% from last quarter and 7% from Q3 '11. Our Cana program continues to drive the increases that we're seeing in the Mid-Continent. With third quarter equivalent volumes averaging 184 million a day, we were up 28 million a day from last quarter and a very attractive 45 million a day from Q3 '11.","In a nutshell, our Q3 production tied very closely to our model, with volumes ramping as we had projected in the second half of the year as a result of strong production adds from both the Permian and the Mid-Continent.","As we look forward, with anticipated continued strong production growth in the Permian and Mid-Continent, our model is now projecting Q4 for us to see average net daily equivalent volumes in the range of 652 million to 677 million a day. That's up 8% to 13% from Q4 '11 volumes and projects into a record exit rate for the company.","With this projection, our resulting 4-year 2012 production guidance equated to 620 million to 626 million a day, gave us a midpoint of 623 million a day, which if you recall last quarter's full year guidance of 622 million. We're now looking at slightly higher midpoint, up 1 million a day from last quarter's guidance.","At a midpoint of 623 million a day, we'd fall in the 5% to 6% production growth range over our 2011 volumes.","Shifting gears over to OpEx, with the overall cost increases the industry has seen over the last year as we've talked about in previous calls, LOE has been an important focus for not only our production group, but our drilling and exploration teams as well.","As we've mentioned in our previous calls, our primary focus has been in reducing the saltwater disposal cost, particularly in the Permian, as well as to implement measures to control our workover costs companywide. Well, with our cost control efforts showing up on the books, our Q3 lifting costs came in at $1.07 per Mcfe. That's down $0.09 or 7.8% from Q2, and it's a $0.07 lower lifting cost than we had in Q3 '11.","We'll continue our focus on LOE, and as such, as we look forward into Q4 with our projected volumes, we have been able to revise our full year LOE guidance downward to the range of $1.11 to $1.16. We're very proud of the progress that our production exploration drilling, the permitting teams have done and with regard to saltwater disposal costs, they've certainly made a big impact in our net income statement.","On the service cost side, in general, we're seeing most drilling-related costs be staying somewhat flat. But we are starting to see some evidence of a slightly softening market. As far as rigs are concerned, 1,500 horsepower top drives are still in demand but some recently quoted day rates for new rigs have reflected up to a 5% drop from the rates that we've seen in prior quarters.","Our completion costs are seeing a similar type of market, especially in the Permian, where improved pump time efficiencies and competition amongst various vendors have helped to reduce our frac-related service costs.","In Cana, our improved drilling efficiencies continue to benefit the program. Our current Cana core AFE of $7.4 million is down $100,000 from the number we quoted last quarter, $200,000 from the quarter prior and $600,000 from where we began the year.","In the Permian, second and third Bone Spring programs, our drilling and completion costs are again staying fairly flat. Depending on debt, our 8,500 to 11,000-foot TVD second Bone Spring wells with 4,000-foot laterals, continue to run in the $6.5 million to $7.1 million range, while our 11,500-foot TVD West Texas Third Bone Spring wells with similar length laterals our AFEing in the $7.5 million range.","In the Third Bone Spring program, as you may recall, we're down about $500,000 on our AFEs from where we began the year. In our Wolfcamp program, our current completed well AFEs are now running closer to $7.5 million to $7.7 million, as Tom alluded to. We're proud of getting that number down from the $8 million to $8.5 million level we quoted last call  and it's basically as a result of improvements in both drilling efficiencies and design.","In addition to our gained operational efficiencies, just as an example, we now have 1 rig in Culberson running on dual fuel, burning both natural gas and diesel, and we'll soon be taking that number up to 2. Each rig will therefore, equate to about $60,000 per well in reduced fuel costs with the implementation of that system.","So in summary, we had another good quarter. Our Q3 production came in a bit better than planned, setting numerous records along the way. Our projection for Q4 results in a slightly higher projection for Q2 -- or for 2012 production than our last estimate. Our efforts to reduce LOE are reflected in a significantly reduced lifting cost. And with service costs flat, we're making good strides to further reduce our overall drilling and completion costs.","With that, I think I'll turn the call over to questions. Paul had thought most of the material he'd be talking about would be included in the discussions we've already had. So we'd turn the call over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a question from Mario Barraza with Tuohy Brothers.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Mario Barraza, Tuohy Brothers. Could you guys just talk a little bit more about looking ahead to '13? What are you really looking for in the next few months on the Cana side, where you're thinking of holding the rig count firm at 4 rigs? What kind of gas price are you thinking about to keep it at 4 rigs or what else would you like to see if you were to pull back further?","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, Mario, this is Tom. What we're looking for right now is a little bit of flexibility. I will say that we're very pleased with where Cimarex is in terms of an asset mix. We're seeing, as always, a fair amount of volatility in the commodity, and we're not sure where it's going to go. There are reasonable viewpoints out there that, with a little bit of winter, we could see significant strengthening in gas prices, and of course oil is anybody's guess. So we like having that flexibility. We have projects in Cana that are generating very nice returns. In fact, I will say the section that those 4 rigs are moving to generates returns in the mid-30s, after-tax at current costs and current commodity pricing. So those are acceptable to us. They're good rigs, they are performing rigs, and it gives us a little optionality to get into the winter and see what gas prices are before we laid our rig fleet down. So what we're looking for, first and foremost, are returns, but our decision to keep the 4 rigs running at least through, I would say, late January, early February, is to give us a little flexibility so that we wouldn't stop, start and be herky-jerky with that program.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And Cana, you'd hinted that or you'd said that some of the Cana wells were tracking a little below your type curve. What did you encounter with the first batch of wells and how have you tweaked your drilling and completion techniques to get an improvement in the production rates there?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, they're completion techniques, not drilling techniques. They are underperforming our type curve. We've been studying it. We think we have the answer and we are implementing them now in some wells we complete. So we'll have some more detail in the next few weeks as to whether that is indeed the case. We're remediating some of our existing wells. It's still in the throes of technical discussions and I don't want to get too granular on particular details and what we're doing, but we have made some adjustments. And we think we have the problem fixed but the proof will be in the flowback.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Portillo with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions for me. In terms of the Cana, could you talk a little bit about the, I guess, the returns that you're currently looking at in the Cana versus your Wolfcamp wells? And how you think about that capital allocation? So as you're running these 4 flex rigs in the Cana, how did that compete for capital against your Wolfcamp position heading into 2013?","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, Matt, this is Tom. I will say that the projects that we're moving those 4 rigs on are competing heads-up. They're nice fairly liquids rich and compete nicely with the Wolfcamp. The Wolfcamp we're seeing currently, we're in a little bit of a depressed oil and natural gas liquids, but still we're seeing roughly a 30% after-tax on that Wolfcamp well. And we've got a fair amount of upside there as our drilling costs come down, and our results continue to be high-graded. But also in that Culberson County, we do have a lease exploration issue that we're managing through. It's not severe, but we like it enough that we're going to hold every acre that we control there with very few exceptions. So Culberson's going to see a fair amount -- we'll probably have 2 rigs running. We may go to more but no fewer than 2 to 3 rigs running continuously on that play through 2013. So my short answer -- actually, that's a long answer. But that section that we're putting those 4 rigs on competes heads-up. But for the rest of Cana, it's held by production. I think if we don't see any relief in some of our product pricing, we're more likely to slow down further in Cana, possibly, and going to 0  operated rigs.","Paul Korus","It's Paul. But we'll also have a significant non-operating expenditure next year in Cana.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes.","Paul Korus","Production adds.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes. No, we'll have a very active program Cana next year. The situation, and we've described this in the past, there are a lot of operators working in Cana now and we have a significant exposure to non-operated interest. So that gives us -- it's good news, bad news. The good news is we'll still have a significant Cana position and we'll have the opportunity to move our swing capital to Permian.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then I guess, just in regards to the second and third Bone Springs, as we think about your rig count there, as we head into 2013, can you talk a little bit about your inventory visibility and kind of should we think about that as a relatively flat program or could that potentially accelerate further?","Thomas E. Jorden","We haven't forward [ph] our 2013 plans or at least, they haven't gelled. I will tell you that I would expect our second and third Bone Spring programs to be roughly comparable to what we did this year. And so that -- just those 2 programs alone would probably be somewhere in the $450 million to $650 million of drilling, and that's about flat to what we did this year. But again, we're still working through our 2013 capital plans.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just a last question for me, in terms of the Cana itself, just wanted to -- if we could get an idea of kind of where the backlog on the uncompleted wells will be at year end? And how you guys are thinking about just working down that backlog over time?","Joseph R. Albi","Yes, this is Joe. Our current frac schedule, we're looking at both us, as well as operator and then and then as a non operator. But right now, we're looking at ending the year, getting into 2013 with a total of 21 net wells that would still be in need of frac, and 18 of those would be our operated wells and then 5 non op and again that's a projection based on an ever moving frac schedule. But as of the end of this quarter, to just give you an idea as of September 30, we still had 28 Cana net wells waiting on frac, and that number is not moving down a heck of a lot by the end of the year because we've got continued drilling through the end of the year and then as we then take those 4 rigs down south to another section, we'll slowly catch up on this. So our current schedule called us to be in that late second quarter timeframe by the time we were done frac-ing most all of the Cana wells.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] You have a question from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of quick questions for you. On the -- I know you haven't come out with the 2013 capital budget yet. I know you've talked at various times in the past about keeping flexibility around the range of maybe in the $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion type of range. When you look at cash flow and you're willingness to outspend with the balance sheet by $100 million to $200 million and then the potential for an asset sale. I know, you're preserving flexibility. But is it safe to say that at this -- I mean, in the current environment you're probably leaning towards the higher end of that range?","Mark Burford","Yes, Ron, this is Mark. Yes, that'd be correct. If we have cashflows in the $1.2 billion and we're talking about $1 billion as part of that $100 million to $200 million and at that point further property sales, yes, we'll be in the upper end of that range of the $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. So yes.","Thomas E. Jorden","But Ryan, a budget has a loose guideline, and we will adapt depending on our own success, market conditions and other factors.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then one more, if I might. In the Wolfcamp, I know you had talked about potential for 2 to 3 rigs there, as well as some of the leaseholding requirements. Is there an upper limit in terms of how many rigs that you think you could run there? And how -- what's the infrastructure looking like out there in Culberson County? And are there other bottlenecks that we should be aware of?","Thomas E. Jorden","We're in pretty good shape there. I mean, there are always bottlenecks. And any Permian operator, certainly in the Delaware Basin, will tell you that you have to manage carefully both your oil, gas and natural gas liquids takeaways. We do have, though, the infrastructure built. Our operations team has done a fantastic job of putting in an infrastructure that gives us flexibility. We could handle more activity than I quoted. Whether we will or not, we'll see. I mean, certainly, if we have some really nice results in that second Bone Spring. We have the potential to accelerate that. And so I don't think we're constrained. That said, we have so much opportunity around our organization that our challenge, it's a wonderful problem to have, but it's a difficult problem because you can't do it all. I mean, we really do want to preserve the flexibility of our balance sheet, and if there were to be some downstream opportunity that we don't foresee.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And can you remind me -- I think you may have said it earlier but did you say how much of the 100,000 acres you feel like you have in the core there in the Wolfcamp, the second Bone Spring is prospective across how much of that?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, I didn't quote acreage. I did say we have about 125 locations, and those are on maps we've made with thicknesses mapped, where we think it could be prospective. And that's -- we're excited about that. We need to test it. One of the things we don't know, we do have some -- there's been an offset [ph] operator that's drilled a well, that's come in very oily with great rates, and we're very excited about it because it sets us up. But this is a big area. And gas-oil ratios change. Before we just move in a rig and drill all those, we need to sample it, understand where it -- does it get gassy, does it stay oily, a lot of unknowns there, but it sure looks something to be excited about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Coleman with Raymond James.","Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I just had one question on the [indiscernible]. Kind of looking at your gross completed -- or your gross wells for the quarter, it looks like it took a step down in the Permian there in the third quarter from the second quarter. I guess what's driving that? Do you have a lot and will that I guess have some pull throughs into the fourth quarter as you finish the year?","Mark Burford","Yes. Andrew, it's Mark Burford here. We do have  some -- but there's always some fluctuations in the number of [ph] wells because [indiscernible] any one period. And even like in the Paddock program where we have a rig and a completion crew that can add a lot of net wells in a short period of time. But we went from 27 in the first quarter, 37 in the second, and 24 in the third. But that run rate in the 20s is probably the way you would expect, but there's going to be always fluctuations, Andy, from quarter-to-quarter, which is depending on the rigs and smaller wells like the Paddock and whatnots.","Thomas E. Jorden","And frac schedules.","Mark Burford","And frac schedules, right.","Operator","At this time, there are no additional questions.","Thomas E. Jorden","Great. Thank you very much, everyone, for joining us today. We really appreciate it and we look forward to reporting back to you again next quarter. Thank you. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"5569":["Cimarex Energy Co (NYSE:XEC) Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call August  9, 2017 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Karen Acierno - Director of Investor Relations","Tom Jorden - President and Chief Executive Officer","John Lambuth - Senior Vice President of Exploration","Joe Albi - Chief Operating Officer","Mark Burford - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Arun Jayaram - J.

And welcome to the Cimarex Energy Second Quarter Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Karen Acierno. Please go ahead.","Karen Acierno","Good morning. And welcome to the Cimarex\u2019s second quarter 2017 conference call. An updated presentation was posted to our Web site yesterday; we will be referring to this presentation during our call today. As a reminder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements; a number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business. We expect to file our 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2017 later today.","So today, we will begin our prepared remarks with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling activities and results from John Lambuth, SVP of Exploration and then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on our operations including production and well costs. Our CFO, Mark Burford, is also present to help answer any questions. So that we can accommodate more of your questions during the hour we have allotted for the call, we\u2019d like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Feel free to get back in the queue if you like.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Jorden","Thank you, Karen. Thank you to all of you here on the call today. We look forward to updating you on our operation and outlook as well as answering your questions. Cimarex had another very good quarter production for the second quarter averaged 1,156 million cubic feet per day or 193,000 Boe per day. This was above the high end of our guidance range driven by continued improvement in our well results, un-drawing excellence in our field execution and timing of our well completions. As a result, we are modestly increasing our full year production guidance to 1,120 to 1,140 million cubic feet per day or 187,000 to 190,000 Boe per day. Our full year exploration and development capital remains unchanged at $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.","I\u2019d like to take a minute to comment on two topics which have particular interest during this earnings season, infill development well performance and gas ore ratio or GORs. First, a few comments on infill well spacing. As the Delaware Basin and stack place have developed most of the headline grabbing well results have been parent wells. These parent wells standalone and although representative of the reservoir deliverability and completion efficiency, they may not be good indicators of expected well response in infill development. Parent wells are unbounded by nearby wells and therefore do not compete for reserves with nearby wells. As infill development wells are drilled, they may exhibit interference with one another and consequently reduce performance compared to the unbounded parent well. In each area, we seek to find that ideal infill well spacing that optimizes resource capture, rate of return and net present value. The ideal infill well spacing is a function of reservoir properties, completion techniques and commodity pricing. It is a non-unique solution.","At Cimarex, we've put tremendous effort into optimizing our infill development well recoveries and economics. Most of this effort has been focused on understanding the down-hole physics of our stimulations. Our goal is to generate highly efficient near wellbore stimulations and maximize the value for developed sections. You'll hear about some of these results during this call.","We want to focus on results, actual well production and actual cost. The asset test of the success or failure of any infill development pilot lies in how we use the learnings in the planning and execution of the next spacing pilot. Are we putting our next batch of development wells closer together or farther apart? We are very pleased with the progress of our teams in this regard. Across our asset base, our next generation of infill development pilots is testing tighter well spacing and additional development zones.","We are pushing the envelope based upon our growing understanding. Jon will discuss our results as well as upcoming pilots. Each infill development pilot tests something new. As I said, the goal is to maximize resource recovery, minimize well to well interference and increase the economic value of our projects. Furthermore, by pushing well spacing tighter and tighter, we further expand our deep inventory of top tier drilling locations. As always, results are what count.","Secondly, I'd like to say a few words regarding the ongoing discussion of GOR. We've been at this a long time and detailed reservoir of our management, engineering and forecasting are in our DNA. Our current drilling and completion activity spans two prolific basins with deferring in situ hydrocarbon types, reservoir properties, pressure regimes and depths. GOR is not a one size fits all issue and can exhibit tremendous variability depending among the fluid phase and the reservoir among other factors.","The phenomenon of decreasing yield or increasing GOR is different for each area for each pressure regime, for each reservoir and for each completion style. All of our type curves all of our forecasts and all of our economics account for either decreasing yield overtime or an increasing GOR overtime. And we performed look-backs our historical production to make sure that we are properly modeling these effects. We have intentionally studied this issue for many, many years and are confident that we are properly accounting for these phenomena in our reserve bookings and in our type curves.","Finally, let me make a few comments about capital investment as we look ahead into 2018. This has been a subject of much discussion during the past few months with some voices issuing a siren-call for the industry to exercise capital discipline in response to the macro oil environment. Capital discipline is one of those catch phrases that mean something different to everyone who utters it. Although, we\u2019re not prepared to give a specific outlook for 2018 capital, I can offer some thoughts on how we approach the problem.","In 2016 and 2017, year-to-date, we have achieved excellent returns in our capital investments even by historical standards. As we look back on the past five years, our 2016 and 2017 returns exceed the returns we achieve during the halcyon days of 2013 and early 2014. This is due to significantly increased well productivity, lower cost and the growing capital efficiency of our infill development projects. We stress test every investment down to $40 and $30 flat NYMEX oil and $250 and $2 flat NYMEX gas to ensure our return on capital, if prices were to fall further.","Cimarex is moving forward with a great investment portfolio, a deep inventory and a commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet. The macro environment will do what it may, we will navigate through it. It makes no sense for us to sit on the sidelines and wait for a better macro environment. If each company responds individually to the quality of their investment opportunities and manages their balance sheet as they individually see fit, free markets will sort out the macro; some will succeed and some will fail; Cimarex is moving ahead. We are committed to be clear and transparent on these and other topics in our investment communications. We look forward to entertaining any follow-up questions you may have on development infill spacing, GOR or any other topics.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John for operational detail.","John Lambuth","Thanks, Tom. I\u2019ll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity before getting into some of the specifics of our latest well results and plans for remainder of 2017. During the second quarter, Cimarex invested $296 million on exploration and development activities. About 54% of our second quarter capital was invested in the Permian region with the rest going for activities in the Mid-Continent region.","We invested $216 million of the $296 million on the drilling and completion of new wells. Companywide, we brought 51 gross, 18 net wells on production during the second quarter of 2017. Our 2017 exploration and development budget is unchanged at $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion with $850 million to $950 million still earmarked for drilling and completing wells. For the full year, we plan to invest 62% of our capital in the Permian region with remaining earmarked for Mid-Continent. We currently operate 14 gross rigs, eight in the Permian region and six in Mid-Continent.","Now on to some specific well results. I\u2019ll start in the Permian region where we have exciting results to share with you, regarding another successful down-spacing project in the Upper Wolfcamp. This pilot took place on the Pagoda state lease and Reeves County, Texas. We drilled four 10,000 foot laterals testing the equivalent of 16 wells per section spacing. As mentioned in our press release, these wells had an average 30 day peak initial production of 1,922 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 956 barrels per day was oil or 50%.","Slide 20 shows the performance of these wells since coming online in late April. As you can see after 60 days, this pilot is performing as well as the Wood State development, which tested 12 wells per section. Based on the Pagoda results, we now plan to test the equivalent of 18 wells per section in the Upper Wolfcamp in the nearby Snowshoe section. This spacing pilot will consist of eight 10,000 foot laterals stacked\/staggered in three different ventures within the Upper Wolfcamp. This pilot will spud in the fourth quarter of 2017 with first production expected in third quarter of 2018.","In Culberson County, we continue to delineate our Upper Wolfcamp acreage with two 10,000 foot laterals coming on line in the second quarter. These two wells achieved an impressive average 30 day peak IP rate of 2,950 barrels of oil equivalent per day of which 51% was oil. Staying on the Culberson County area, the Lower Wolfcamp, Tim Tam pilot, has been on production for a little over six months. As shown, on the cumulative production versus days plot on slide 17 of the presentation, these infill wells are performing as well as nearby parent wells with similar landing zones.","Our learnings from the Tim Tam pilot have helped us design our next Lower Wolfcamp pilot. Called Animal Kingdom, this eight well 10,000 foot lateral pilot will be testing the equivalent of 14 wells per section by both decreasing the spacing between wells and a bench plus adding an additional landing zone in the top port of the Lower Wolfcamp, a zone that we used to refer to as Wolfcamp C. A wine rack display for this pilot can be seen on page 17 of our presentation. We plan to spud this pilot in the fourth quarter of 2017 with first production expected in the second quarter of 2018.","In Lea County, New Mexico between now and year-end, we plan to drill two 10,000 foot laterals in the Upper Wolfcamp in our Red Hills acreage block. The results of these wells will go a long ways to helping us finalize a plant Upper Wolfcamp spacing pilot on this acreage with our preliminary design calling for testing the equivalent of 12 wells per section and one landing zone. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll be spudding an avalanche spacing pilot that will be testing to equivalent of 20 wells per section, and a stacked\/staggered pattern within one zone.","Now on to the Mid-Continent. We continue to grow Meramec wells that both delineate, while holding our Meramec term lease position. We completed seven Meramec wells in the second quarter of which four were 10,000 foot laterals. These four wells achieved an average 30 day IP rate of 2,073 barrels of oil equivalent per day of which 52% was oil. We continue to be on frac to HBP all of our Meramec for makers by the end of this year.","And then finally, wells in our Woodford eight well increased density pilot that is testing both 16 and 20 Woodford wells per section are now online. Results from this pilot, along with a nearby two well Meramec Woodford stack test, will help determine our plans for future developments, including our operative sections adjacent to the upcoming Leota\u2010Jacobs drill. We will be participating in the three non-operative sections with an estimated spud date in December of 2017.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joe Albi","Well, thank you John. And thank you all for joining our call today. I\u2019ll recap the usual items; our second quarter production; our updated 2017 production outlook; and then I\u2019ll finish up with a few comments on LOE and service cost. As Tom mentioned, we had a great quarter here in the second quarter. Our net equivalent production came in at 1.156 Bcfe per day that\u2019s beat our upper end of our guidance by 26 million a day and it\u2019s setting new records for total company production.","With our focus on Permian and high liquids Mid-Continent projects, we saw a solid 11% sequential quarter increase in our oil production with oil volumes up in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent. Our total Company oil volumes had a record of 57,871 barrels per day. With the strong contribution from the Reeves County Pagoda state infill project, which John mentioned, our Q2 17 Permian net equivalent volume came in at 645 million a day, up 12% from Q1 17 and 27% from Q2 16. We brought on a total of 11 gross and 10 net Permian wells during the quarter, and we had 27 gross and 13 net wells waiting on completion at quarter end.","We also saw a nice gain in our Q2 Mid-Continent volumes with continued production adds from our East Cana infill project and our Meramec program. Our second quarter Mid-Continent net equivalent production came in at 509 million a day, up 5% from Q1 17. In total, we brought on 40 gross and eight net Mid-Continent wells during the quarter with 71 gross and 16 net wells waiting on completion at quarter end.","Looking forward into 2017, we've updated our model to incorporate Q2 results and our projected drilling and completion schedule for the remainder of the year. With that, we've increased our full year guidance to 1.12 Bcfe to 1.15 Bcfe per day, that's up from the 1.09 Bcf to 1.13 Bcf per day reported in our last call and it reflects the 16% to 18% increase over the 963 million a day that we reported in 2016.","With our 2017 capital focused on high-liquid Permian and Mid-Continent projects, we continue to project significant oil growth in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent for the remainder of the year, forecasting total company year-over-year oil production growth in the range of 24% to 29%. Our projected 2017 capital allocation remained skewed with 62% to the Permian and 37% to the Mid-Continent. We anticipate bringing 61 net Permian wells and 34 net Mid-Continent wells online during 2017.","As we mentioned in last call, we're forecasting Permian and Mid-Continent continent completion activity to ramp up here in late Q3 and into Q4. And as a result, we're modeling Q3 volumes to be relatively flat with Q2, followed by a very nice ramp in Q4. Third quarter volumes are projected to range between 1.1 Bcfe to 1.14 Bcfe per day with forecasted Q4 volumes to be in the neighborhood of 1.16 Bcfe to 1.20 Bcfe per day, a strong 21% to 25% increase over Q4 16. With 44 net wells projected to be either drilling or waiting on completion at the end of the year, we anticipate having a great bit of momentum going into 2018.","Jumping over to OpEx. Our second quarter lifting cost came in at $0.59 per Mcfe, that's just below the lower end of our guidance of $0.60 Mcfe to $0.70 per Mcfe and down from our first quarter average of $0.65. Although, we are seen some recent cost pressures in items such as water hauling, well servicing and equipment and maintenance, we kept our lifting cost in check during the quarter and we\u2019ll continue our focus to maintain the reduced operating cost structure we've worked so hard at obtaining and have been able to achieve.","The remaining year guidance, we've kept our previous lifting cost range of $0.60 Mcfe to $0.70 per Mcfe, which takes into account the fluctuating nature of workover expenses and our 2017 focus on high-liquid projects. And finally, some comments on drilling and completion costs. As compared to Q1, most drilling cost components remained relatively flat with the exception of tubulars, which are up 10% to 12% and wire line services, which have increased around 15% to 20% during the quarter. To help offset any growing cost increases, we\u2019re keeping our focus on drilling efficiencies. As an example, in our Wolfcamp program, we\u2019ve reduced the medium days from spud to rig release from 29 days in 2016 to 25 days in 2017.","With completion cost, representing 60% to 70% of our total well cost, we continue to refine our completion designs to offset the recent cost pressures we\u2019ve seen. All the while, we remain focused on improving well productivity. We\u2019ve been able to offset a good portion of the service and prop cost increases by utilizing fewer stages and pumping zipper fracs where we can, and continue to focus on long lead time planning to ensure adequate prop sourcing and availability.","That said, as compared to Q4 \u201916, market increases have increased our average per well frac cost by approximately 300,000 to 500,000 per well, which again is dependent on so many variables, such as lateral length, number of stages, pounds pumped, chemical, et cetera. After incorporating market and completion design changes, as well as our continued efficiency gains, we\u2019ve made some slide modifications to our total well cost estimates. In the Permian, our current Wolfcamp 2-mile AFEs are running $10.5 million to $12 million with a slightly raising the upper end of the range from last call for market, while keeping the low end the same for efficiencies gained for zipper fracs, water recycling and multiple well facilities.","With the design change to much larger fracs in our Bone Spring program, we\u2019ve raised our current 1-mile lateral AFEs to a range of $5.5 million to $6.7 million. In Cana, with efficiencies and completion design changes, we\u2019ve dropped the low end of our Woodford 1-mile lateral AFE to $7.3 million while keeping the upper end at $8 million. And with design changes and efficiency gains in the Meramec, we\u2019re keeping the low end of our over 2-mile lateral AFE at $10 million, while lowering the upper end to $11.5 million.","In closing, we had a great second quarter. We\u2019re seeing results of our oil focused development program, which generated another production beat for us in Q2 and is targeted to provide us with a nice production ramp here into Q4. With a forecasted strong second half year production, as a springboard, we\u2019re projecting year-over-year production growth of 16% to 18% and a very strong start to 2018. We will stay vigilant for our cost and maximize the returns from our program, despite the changes we are seeing day-to-day in the market. We stay excited and confident about our program and our 2017 results.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call open to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now being the question-and-answer session. Please remember to limit yourself to one question and one follow up [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Arun Jayaram with J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","Tom, my first question is in the Mid-Continent. I want to get your thoughts on the Leota Jacobs pad. I think Devon had talked about 40 to 50 gross wells would have been theirs and then maybe four to five drilling units. How are you thinking about your participation in that project? And if you don\u2019t, where would you think about allocating that capital relative to this year with to be 62% in the Permian and 37% in the Mid-Continent?","Tom Jorden","I\u2019ll just gear key it for John. We really like that project, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re just looking at as we go into 2018. And it's really going to have more impact on 2018, at this point, almost minimal impact on \u201917. We haven\u2019t made a decision as to what we\u2019re going to do with those two operated sections. But I\u2019ll let John comment on that.","John Lambuth","First and foremost, I want to again emphasize when we look at that project, we like very much the rate of return that that project generates. From a long lateral perspective, a more liquid rich area of Woodford, it looks very attractive for us. But we have a lot of moving parts. We have our latest spacing pilot that I mentioned that\u2019s testing much tighter spacing in the Woodford. It is flowing back right now in the coming months, I think we\u2019ll start to get a strong understand of what that impact would have on future spacing in the Woodford. And quite frankly, if it shows, we can go a lot tighter than that almost leads to how many specs as we could do.","And then secondly, we have what I would mention, which is a stack Woodford Meramec little tests that where we\u2019re continually looking at the frac and the frac order and understanding if we\u2019re going to co-develop. Because we still think for maybe Meramec potential there is well, so there is a lot of moving parts there. And then the last part we look at is just the overall capital that we would invest in such a large project and the cycle times to it. We\u2019re very, very comfortable again with participating with Devon on the initial free sections. We\u2019re just now asking ourselves how much more do we want to then operate.","And as Tom mentioned, we really, quite frankly, don\u2019t need to make that decision to later this year for if whether we do one or two additional operative sections, we will not be deploying rigs on that until at the earliest second quarter \u201818. So we have a little time here before we have to make an ultimate decision of how we\u2019re going move forward with that project.","Arun Jayaram","And my follow up. Tom, in the Permian we\u2019ve learned the importance of the execution really this quarter. I was wondering if you could talk about some of -- it sounds as you\u2019re saying in terms -- you talked about cost in terms of OSS availability and how that could impact the industries cycle times. And also I was wondering if you could maybe just elaborate on your management of water in the Permian, and what\u2019s the unique about your water strategy?","Tom Jorden","Well, those are couple of good questions. I\u2019ll give a overview and then John, Joe I am sure want to comment. The managing of the oil field services, we manage through good relationships. We use major service providers and we give them plenty of advance notice on the resources we\u2019ll need. We have constant interactive conversation, and really if managed through good relationship management. We have not to-date chosen to unbundle our services. So we still look at major service providers that give us soup to nut service. And although we\u2019re constantly evaluating that, right now, that\u2019s our approach and we think it\u2019s working for us.","On the water side, we put lot of energy into water management, both the sourcing and disposal side. I think we\u2019ve got some very creative environmentally responsible solutions that we\u2019re implementing. And it\u2019s a challenge. As we go into these big development projects, it's one thing to say how much water each project requires, it's another logistical challenge to deliver that water at the pace we needed, particularly when you\u2019re on pad drilling with zipper fracs. And with that, I'll let Joe comment on either one of those issues.","Joe Albi","Tom, I think hit it right on the head. What we started to do is keep ongoing solid business relationships with service providers that we've known over the years and trust. On the frac side, I think we talked about this in prior calls. We\u2019re not want to jump from two crews to three to four to five to six, and then back to three. We\u2019re currently running four crews right now and have a very consistent operation going where we\u2019re moving the crews between the two different areas, we know the crews they know our operations that it becomes and efficient operation. By doing that, we\u2019re not constantly out in the market trying to find fleets.","In particular, like on the completion side, if we were to go out and trying out of a fleet, I'm guessing we\u2019d be looking at three to four weeks before we could line one up and have it on a well location. If we do that add it and then drop it, it's not really doing us much good. And this why we\u2019re able to work our completion schedule no different than we would our rigs schedule, shuffling wells around optimizing fleets that we have. That relationship that we have with our serviced provider for the fracs and stimulation, we've been able to ensure adequate prop sourcing and availability by long lead times planning and let them use their size and scale to procure the supplies that we need, and that\u2019s worked out just fine.","It's pretty much the same on the drilling side, the providers that we\u2019re using are all established providers that we have solid business relationships and have had over the years. They know we\u2019re going to have an active drilling program year-over-year after year and that just pays off in stage as far as been able to obtain rigs and keep them working. So I don\u2019t know if that help answer your question, but that should be the thoughts that I would add.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal Dingmann","Tom, my first question for you or Jon, I was just looking at I think it was on slide 10 where you just talked about the change or actually not much change really in profit over the years I guess. Just one slight change I did see was in the Woodford where you took the prop down a little bit. Could you just talk about that? It seems like nothing all, but others are starting to do back away a little bit on profit and still seen equally as good wells, if you could just, Jon, if you and Tom could just comment on the completion technique around there?","John Lambuth","This is John. I guess as I've always say when this question comes up, stand pounds for the lateral foot is an interesting statistic, but it's not one honestly when we talk about our completion designs we focus on. We really focus all our attention on the cluster, the amount of sand per cluster, how many per stage in order to get the most effective stimulation to achieve, like Tom mentioned, that near bore-hole conductivity and then high productivity an offshoot of that design then is our -- then you then get sand for lot of foot.","We don\u2019t really design for that. And again, we look at it just in terms of what sand per cluster what achieves at best. I guess you could -- by the numbers, it looks were flattening out. If I felt like then we can get a better approve well by adding sand and we would do that. Right now, most of our changes are along like I said the number of clusters, how many can we treat within the stage, just become a very important thing we look at because again that helps on the cost side of it. But in the end, it's still the result of the well, so that's kind of we're at today.","Neal Dingmann","And then just looking at slide 13, where you talked about just the Lower Wolfcamp, the Tim Tam infill and again, certainly performed very well. Could you talk about in that area and Tom, I think you were talking about potentially further infill projects. I don't know number one, what's the plan for further infill projects around that area? And if so, will most of those continue to be in the Lower Wolfcamp?","Tom Jorden","Well, John will give you little more color that. But that Animal Kingdom he mentioned that's a Lower Wolfcamp project it's just south of Tim Tam. The volume rack for that is on slight 17, page 17. That's a significant test for us, because it tests three landing zones in that Lower Wolfcamp. That Lower Wolfcamp is prolific over just about all this acreage. It yield or oil content will change over the acreage but we see it as a very strong economically viable target throughout this asset, particularly with 10,000 foot laterals. So we're pretty excited about this Animal Kingdom test. John do you want to\u2026","John Lambuth","The only other comment I'd make is I just can't tell you how excited we are about the Tim Tam. As you can see on the display on page 17, in my remarks, I talked about how the infill wells are matching the parents. Quite frankly they're exceeding the parents now. So I think this just speaks to -- this is really all with our frac design and we've really homed in with this interval in terms of the appropriate frac design to lead to achieve that type of result. And give us the confidence to go even tighter, both between wells and to add that third bench as we're about to do in Animal Kingdom.","So yes, we're very excited about the opportunities that here in the Lower Wolfcamp as we are with the Upper Wolfcamp of course in Culberson. And as I keep reminding folks, the nice thing is they are completely independent, the upper and the lower from a development standpoint, meaning we can develop one and come back at a much later date and develop the other and have no intention upon the production stream from the other interval. So it's a great position.","Neal Dingmann","So would that mean you would have one, I mean you did infill on each, you\u2019d have one still a separate parent on each of those then?","John Lambuth","Well, in terms of parents, we probably in each area have one parent as an earning well to hold our acreage, early-on on this acreage in order to ensure that we held our entire Wolfcamp rights a lot of lease called for the, essentially you got to the deepest depth that's why a lot our early wells weren\u2019t Lower Wolfcamp. We're at a point now where we have great optionality to choose where we want to go with those bore holes in that acreage. And like I said, we may choose to go develop an Upper Wolfcamp interval first and then come back many years later and develop lower. We're in a very good position to have that optionality there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Drew Venker","I want to just chop on the questions around inflation and service providers. You obviously sound like you're very happy with having an integrated service offering as that helps you in a lot of ways. But you also alluded to self sourcing some of those elements. So just curious if you think self sourcing would actually lead to cost savings, keeping in mind that it might lead to other issues. Or is it really minimal potential amount of savings and the execution benefit is really why you stick with integrating providers?","Joe Albi","When you look at the frac, you\u2019ve got the water, the sand and then for the most part, the service cost. The water we are self sourcing and we\u2019re doing everything we can to be as efficient with not only the source of the water but been able to recycle the water and optimize and reduce our cost there. I mentioned that we\u2019re procuring our sand basically through business relationships that we have. If we were to breakout the components of the frac into service cost and sand and look at the average cost per well, the real driver in the same are service costs.","And what we\u2019ve seen is that we saw a rapid increase in the dollars per stage to pump our frac from Q4 into the tail end of the first quarter. And that same has seem to have flat toed, and we believe that it has a very good chance of staying that way for the remainder of the year. What we\u2019re doing to offset that is kind of and everything John said as a result of our completion design changes, not necessarily because the cost but because of the design changes, we\u2019re pumping less sand, so that cost the well has gone down.","We\u2019re pumping fewer stages so we\u2019ve been able to reduce the overall impact of those cost and the bottom line is that when you look at our average cost to pump a frac job per well even though we\u2019ve seen way over 20%, 30%, 40% increases in some of these cost items, we kept our completion cost in check. And so that\u2019s the angle that we\u2019re taking and we believe it\u2019s working well for us.","Tom Jorden","This is an ongoing discussion, and our answer is certainly not ideological. If we felt like it was a real add to our rate of returns to unbundle and source these individually, we would do that and we look at that on ongoing basis. But I\u2019ll just make -- I will make one philosophical comment. Our organization is effective because of its focused and we\u2019re lean and that makes us a better company than if we had laid out parts of the organization far and wide. We manage by eye contact and we are a discipline focus company.","So if you tell me we\u2019ll have a group of people that are going to be distracted by worrying about what truck fleet will bring sand from one mine to our location, I really have those people worry about efficiency of our completions, efficiency of our production and gaining our well performance the absolute top tier that it did. So there is a little bit of a philosophical bias towards focusing here. And if we have good vendors, I can do that and if the close call on cost, we\u2019re probably going to maintain our focus on things that really count.","Drew Venker","And then on the Culberson County Upper Wolfcamp, you talked about a nice couple of well results this quarter. Can you talk about how that zone currently stacks up within your opportunity set? And are there any meaningful design change with those two wells that drove the stronger performance?","John Lambuth","I mean we really like the outcome. And what I really like is I think people have noted we continue to get even better those wells. And so yes we continue to tanker with both the completion design but also the landing zone within that Upper Wolfcamp interval. We\u2019re a little bit -- later in our understanding a bit like we are in the lower, so we\u2019re still coming up the learning curve. With each change we make, it\u2019s just keeps getting better and better. So we\u2019re very, very pleased with -- the latest results in that interval and the fact that it seems to now be an interval that seems very perspective over all of our acreage throughout that Culberson JDA, which I don\u2019t know that we could have said that a year-ago. So it's really turned into a top tier opportunity for us throughout that asset there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeb Bachmann with Scotia Howard Weill. Please go ahead.","Jeb Bachmann","Tom, just to close it up I guess on the service side, talk about mitigating cost. Just wondering, are you guys looking at maybe using some of the localized sand products that are going to be available on larger quantities in 2018 doing san that kind of stuff to help lower completion cost?","Tom Jorden","Yes, we've looked at that. We haven\u2019t used that local sand yet. I think others have talked about it. We've looked at crushing strength of that sand, and it\u2019s couple of thousand PSI less than what we\u2019re currently sourcing. We will -- that maybe okay and we may experiment with it, but we haven\u2019t done that just yet. Joe, do you want to add to that?","Joe Albi","The only thing I would add is I think most all of those deals, if you will, are going to require some kind of commitment or certain poundage over some period of time. We don\u2019t make that many commitments and when we make them, we fulfill them. And we want to be able to have flexibility to start-stop, do whatever we need to without having some overhead. So to the extent that we\u2019d require committing to large volumes of sand on a frequent consistent basis, it's something where you look hard and long before we even think about doing.","Jeb Bachmann","And I guess my follow-up and I'll try to get an answer for this one. But the Northern New Mexico play that you guys have built an acreage position in that I guess you talked about you participating in a well going forward, or doing that well. Can you give any details on that at this point?","John Lambuth","I would just simply say we have a lot of different opportunities in the Mexico. I mean I can also tell you that we have quite a few wells coming up in the Mexico. But in particular, I think the well you\u2019re talking about is one that we have drilled and we\u2019re evaluating. And that\u2019s all I\u2019ll really say about it right down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Hall","First, I wanted to ask on the -- in the context of all the development pilots you have ongoing with, the Animal Kingdom pilot, in particular, adding that Wolfcamp C inerrable. Is that -- I'm just trying to understand little bit I guess the thought process behind that. Is it something where you feel like you potentially need to develop that concurrently with D and therefore, you are seeing how they could develop pattern would look and perform? Or is it just something where you think you potentially can enhance the fractured network by layering those intervals on top of one another? Just trying to understand a little better the thought process on that.","John Lambuth","And in some ways in doing this pilot, we\u2019re going to try to answer all those questions. First, let me just take it real quick. We, in the past, have had excellent results in the lower Wolfcamp, especially and what we would call the lower D or D4 member. And up until recently, we have struggled some in the C member, the upper part of lower. But now we have some newer well results that\u2019s given us a lot of encouragement that that particular bench looks as perspective economically as the rest of the lower Wolfcamp, which is why we want to go after and do this test, to add that additional bench there. And as you alluded to convince ourselves exactly how best do we have to develop, but do we have to do it all at once or can we do it independently. Our suspicions is that at that particular lower Wolfcamp is one continuous hydrocarbon system, so it they may be most effective if we co-develop it altogether. But that\u2019s what we want to test, that\u2019s what the Animal Kingdom is designed to tell us.","Tom Jorden","The way I think about this is, in my opening remarks I talked about parent wells always being the best indicators, but they\u2019re meaningful indicator. And the fact that our well responses on these infill projects are coming in so strong compared to those unbounded wells, is really something that there\u2019s some attention. It's speaking to our capital efficiency and the returns of this deep inventory. So when I look at the Animal Kingdom pilot, we look at that entire lower Wolfcamp system and being able to get 14 or more wells out of that. These wells individually stand in their own they\u2019re great returns. And so it\u2019s just efficient resource capture. We\u2019re really interested in that experiment, and it\u2019s a direct benefit to the science work we\u2019ve been going through the last couple of years.","Michael Hall","And then I also just wanted to hit on the GOR topic, and appreciate the new context provided in the opening remarks. I guess, there\u2019s been some commentary, some within the industry and investor group that condensate reservoirs could have somewhat different characteristics, and that\u2019s straight oil reservoirs that you\u2019ve see in the Midland Basin. And in that context, Culberson County has been brought up. Any commentary you can provide, specific to Culberson County, as it relates to oil yield over time and what give you confidence that retrograding will not be an issue overtime, and has not been in the past?","Tom Jorden","Well, let me just take a stab at and then John or Joe may want to jump in here. Our lens is rate to return. I mean this issue is interesting, but we properly model our response. I think many of you who have followed us know we do a very exhaustive annual look back, we go back 15 years and we update the production on every well we\u2019ve ever drilled. We update the cost, we update the commodity price file and produced into and we update our returns. And that\u2019s a really important exercise for us, because it levels and grounds our future decision.","And we\u2019ve got a very confident analysis of our production history, including Culberson County. Culberson County does go from oil into reservoir to gas into reservoir. So there are varying issues around that play. But as long as we\u2019re properly modeling that stream, that hydrocarbon stream, rate of return is that lens that means something to us. And these are lights out outstanding rates of return. But specific to reservoir issues, I am going to let John or Joe either comment\u2026","John Lambuth","I\u2019ll just say real quick is, as Tom alluded, we have a large acreage position and a multi-variable hydrocarbon system there that any one well or project we looked at has its own design GOR or yield profile. We don\u2019t try to slab the same yield profile over life of the well across all that acreage, we would never do that; it\u2019s variable across the acreage depending upon both the pressure, we know that the reservoir to be at and the initial yield; and then from there, our expectation of what that yield will do overtime. And I\u2019m very proud to say because of like Tom said the look backs we do, the checks we do, I feel very confident, and the economics presented to me is a true representation of what that well and how well will perform, both on its gas and its oil.","Joseph R. Albi","I guess how I would answer that is, the phase behavior is different for all different types of hydrocarbon composition, as you know. Alluding to what Tom said if that phase behavior it's characteristics will ultimately show up in how wells produced. And so for using older wells and how they produce it's given us a DNA print of that phase behavior. Those are wells those forecasts are what we\u2019re using to predict our new wells. So in our mines, we are truly modeling in the phase behavior of the reservoir.","The type curves that we put together are oil; the in place calculations that we make when we perform biometrics are oil; the recovery calculations that we come up with are based on oil; we\u2019re forecasting an oil curve; the gas relationships to that curve, the gas becomes a secondary hydrocarbon by-product. To the extent that GOR goes up, the well makes more gas for the same barrels of oil that we\u2019re forecasting. And so that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at it. And the bottom line is what is those forecasts for oil and for gas ultimately, from a rate on return on our capital investment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Robertson from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeff Robertson","Tom, just the question is how you\u2019re thinking about the business now. It sounds like you\u2019re moving more towards bigger pilots where you will drill a number of wells that may have six to nine month type lead times. Can you just talk about how you balance the answers you\u2019re trying to get from those pilots and the capital that\u2019s required to implement them until production? And how that tracks in with sources and uses and things like that?","Tom Jorden","Well, that\u2019s a harder the matter, Jeff. It\u2019s frustrating, because these projects have long lead times. And so to the extent that you\u2019re trying to turnaround, one turnaround your investment, you make the investment you want to get cash flow as soon as possible. That lead time is hard to swallow. And then to the extent that you\u2019re testing a concept, we go crazy waiting for the results. And so we\u2019re trying to kind of parse them up in the byte size pieces. You\u2019ll see in the lot of our pilot, they maybe three, four, rather small experiments. That\u2019s a challenge in and of it-self because a meaningful infill pilot needs to have meaningful number of bounded wells. But there is no right answer there. But the good news is our returns, as I said at the outset, are moving up. I mean we really are in an era of very good returns on historical basis.","So I\u2019m willing to live with that lumpiness as long as it\u2019s modeled-in in our return profile and the time value to money that\u2019s deployed in that infill project, it's properly accounted for then the lumpiness is with the lumpiness say. And we\u2019ve always tailored and spoken to that long-term investor then our stands at and isn\u2019t going to get nervous quarter-by-quarter. You\u2019re going to see a little bit of lumpiness. But we will generate consistent long-term returns. And then finally you asked about how we\u2019re viewing the business.","We're probably in the new normal. We don\u2019t wake up every day and wait for that rescue ships. At the beginning of this downturn, 2014, I say at the time that we told our organization that the rescue ship is not coming we need to figure out how to make a living in this environment in these conditions, and not wait for the ship over the horizon. And that's kind of where we are. We can make a good living in this environment. Our assets can support it and we're moving ahead. I mean this is the new normal.","Jeff Robertson","Tom, do you show in terms of capital efficiency. Is there a sweet spot as far as what the size of these pilots needs to be for capital efficiency? Or is it more just getting you know what questions you\u2019re trying to get the answers to and figure out the right spacing to try to see if that provides the answers?","Tom Jorden","I am going to let John handle that one.","John Lambuth","Again, that's an excellent question, something that we looked at a lot in terms of -- and I wouldn\u2019t even use the word pilot, I would call development. I mean the reality is we're getting pretty close, saying Culberson and upper Wolfcamp to where we\u2019re thinking about development. And the things we look at is; how much at a time, a half section, a full section, two sections; the cycle time for that, the amount of capital it tied up; and then the optionality of it is, that even in our best interest to do it that way or is it better to do in multiple sections. And that's something we're putting a lot of effort into.","And I'll tell you some of the things that govern that, doesn\u2019t even matter of capital, it's like someone mentioned before, can you source all the water you need to get that done, can you get enough frac crews, is it enough sand. So that's something we\u2019re putting a lot of attention to right now, because we see ourselves moving, making that progression to where it isn\u2019t pilots anymore, it's development. And I really, I think you could argue like in some areas we\u2019re already there. And so we're asking ourselves how much do we want to do at each time, and it is that optimal, both capital but also effected this at wells in terms of when you come later and drill next of them.","I feel very good about where we\u2019re getting to, especially in Reeves and Culberson. And again, I think what you\u2019re going to see here us slowly talk about more about what development really likes on this large acreage position that we\u2019re fortunate to have.","Tom Jorden","Jeff, another thing I\u2019ll add is things go wrong and much as we hated, things go wrong. And so one of the challenges is, if you\u2019re going to march off on a 100 well project and first flow back is, by the time you\u2019re already committed to the full project and something wobbles off, it's not very pleasant. So you do like to get some feedback along the way, particularly if we\u2019re testing something new.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Portillo with TPH. Please go ahead.","Mat Portillo","Just a quick question in regards to the Northern Delaware basin, I was hoping that we might be able to revisit a bit your delineation plans in the second half of the year. And specifically, it appears the industry having a bit of a renaissance in the central and northern part of Lea County. And I'm just curious as to your thoughts on some of the resource potential that might emerge in both the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring horizons?","John Lambuth","We love it. We love the opportunity. We love our acreage position there. I can tell you that, for the remainder of the year, we will be drilling three Avalon, two Bone Springs and three Wolfcamp, upper Wolfcamp wells in New Mexico for the rest of the year. So we are moving up into there. And we\u2019re very, very excited about our acreage position and the returns. Likewise, as I mentioned, we have several pilots that we\u2019re envisioning up there. In fact, already committed to the Avalon pilot and we\u2019re still working on our Wolfcamp pilot. So we\u2019re getting there. But it\u2019s also nice, because as we keep saying, a lot of that acreage is HBP, so it is not bad to have others drill around you and pick their learnings so that when we get there, we\u2019re getting the maximum value out of our acreage. But we are moving in that direction with the rigs later this year.","Tom Jorden","Our Permian team has some pretty interesting wish list for Lea County as we enter 2018. We\u2019re looking at their proposals and we have an allocated capital. But it\u2019s pretty exciting when you look at what they want to do with some of these pilots. And again, as I said, the proofs in the pudding is to what the companies do on the follow ups, and they\u2019ve got some aggressive follow ups that they\u2019d like done up there. So that\u2019s we love it.","Mat Portillo","And then just a quick follow up question regards springs area, obviously an impressive early result there. And you mentioned an 18 well down spacing test in the Wolfcamp. Does that include any sand targets to the XY horizon, or is that just in the upper section of that Wolfcamp development?","John Lambuth","I think, again, we tend to think that as one contiguous hydrocarbon system. We tend to roll then those XY sands and our overall resource in place and feel pretty confident that based on our landing zone, especially in the upper part of the Wolfcamp that we\u2019re more than likely accessing those sands. I don\u2019t know that we necessarily have to put the lateral on the sand to assume that we\u2019re not accessing them. So in some ways what we\u2019re going to try next with the Snowshoe and adding that extra bench of wells, we are in some ways implying that we\u2019re intending to grow up in to that. And again, we see it as a phenomenal resource there. We really, really like what we see out of Pagoda\u2019s, which is why now we want to go ahead and move this quickly as we can test that even tighter spacing with the Snowshoe.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

My name is Jared, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Cimarex Energy First Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Burford, you may begin.","Mark Burford","Thank you, Jared. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today on our first quarter conference call. On today's call, we have Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, COO; Paul Korus, Senior Vice President and CFO; and John Lambuth, Vice President of Exploration.","We issued our financial and operating results news release this morning, a copy of which can be found in our website. I do need to remind you that today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. However, a number of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosure on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and press releases for the risk factors associated with our business. And with that, I'll just go and turn the call over to Tom and let him jump into the details.","Thomas E. Jorden","Thank you, Mark. Welcome, everyone, and I want to say we appreciate your interest in Cimarex. I'd like to take a few minutes to go over the highlights for the quarter before turning the call over to Joe and John for a more detailed look at our operations.","Cimarex reported this morning a very solid first quarter in line with our expectations. Production average 661.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day, growing 10% from first quarter 2012. Our oil production grew 12%, which is actually 20% after adjusting for the property sales. Our first quarter oil volumes averaged 33,154 barrels per day. So we're seeing some very, very nice growth in our oil production.","Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $409 million, funded with internally generated cash flow and $120 million in debt. We expect the bank debt will reach roughly $300 million by the end of the year, and that, of course, is up from 0 at January 1. And that says, our opportunity set continues to exceed our projected cash flow. In total, Cimarex will spend about $1.5 billion in 2013 on high rate of return projects, primarily in the Delaware portion of the Permian Basin and the Cana-Woodford shale.","John and Joe will give you a flavor of that in detail but we see an outstanding opportunity set and great flexibility as we prosecute it. Our Permian program continues to provide great returns, and that's where we'll invest $900 million or about 64% of our total capital this year. Results have been particularly noteworthy in Culberson County, Texas, where we believe the Horizontal Wolfcamp can provide decades of drilling opportunities for Cimarex. In addition, we see encouraging results in the Second Bone Spring in Culberson County. We also see potential in other zones in the stacked pay opportunity and believe this area is on its way to becoming a legacy asset for Cimarex. We're very proud of the work that our teams have done in Culberson County and are extremely optimistic about the development potential, multi-zone.","For the rest of 2013 and into 2014, our Permian program will focus on holding our Culberson acreage. A lot of that acreage is term acreage, and we're on a program to make sure that every prospective acreage gets held by production. So we'll de-risk the acreage as we test other areas and other zones. We're still currently identifying economic sweet spots for potential future infill development. And as John will show, it's a big area. We still have a lot of drilling to do. And as we drill our way forward, we're finding new sweet spots we didn't anticipate. We'll also be doing an evaluation of multi-zone stack lateral development, and that's especially in various ventures of the Wolfcamp shale, along with the Second Bone Spring sand. We're at very early time there and need to have some field experiments before we can definitively comment on ultimate spacing.","And then finally, we'll develop our infrastructure and takeaway strategies to accommodate our growing production. We've put a lot of energy into that in Culberson County, and we're in a commanding position there when it comes to infrastructure. And there are opportunities elsewhere in the basin, and we'll be attacking that. So a good quarter, good execution out of our organization. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi, our Chief Operating Officer.","Joseph R. Albi","Thank you, Tom, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. I'll touch on our first quarter production, update you on our second quarter guidance projections and then follow up with a few words on operating costs and service costs before handing the call over to John. As Tom mentioned, our first quarter volumes came in at 661 million a day, that's a good strong quarter for us. We're above the midpoint of our guidance of 642 million to 667 million, and up 10% from where we were 1 year ago in Q1 '12. If you adjust for our 2012 year end property sale, which took about 15 million a day off the books, we were up 12% from Q1 '12. We saw solid production growth during the quarter despite incurring some downtime associated with plant facility shut-ins, freeze offs and some pipeline maintenance, which equated to about 7 million a day, and most of which came from the Permian.","If we dig a bit deeper into the details, our Mid-Continent region continued to set records for all product categories, whether it be gas, oil, NGLs, total liquids and equivalent volumes. Our Q1 Mid-Continent equivalent volume of 361 million a day was up 15% from Q1 '12, and 3% from last quarter. Cana continues to drive the production increases that we're seeing in the Mid-Continent, with our first quarter volumes of 229 million equivalents a day, up 42% or 68 million a day from a year ago and 15 million a day from last quarter.","In the Permian, our Q1 '13 net equivalent volume of 275 million a day was up a strong 15% or 35 million a day from Q1 '12. Our Permian oil production averaged 25,832 barrels a day, that's up 18% over last year. As compared to Q4 '12, however, our first quarter equivalent volume was down 17 million a day, and this is more or less a direct result of our Permian asset sale on December and the downtime that I mentioned we experienced during the quarter. As we move into the second quarter, however, we've made up that gap. We're seeing a nice, strong upward trend in our Permian production.","Looking at our guidance, we've made no changes to our previously announced full year guidance range of 675 million to 705 million a day. That represents an 8% to 13% increase over 2012. And when adjusting for the December 2012 property sale, we're really projecting a true apples-to-apples increase of 10% to 15% over last year. If you look under the hood of our projection, however, you'd see that we've changed our projected commodity mix. As a result of lower processing yields and new markets, primarily in the Permian, we've lowered our projected NGL volumes for the year. However, offsetting that drop is stronger performance we're seeing from our oil projects, also in the Permian, which, in essence, have kept our total equivalent volume projection unchanged. Where we had originally projected a 1% to 5% increase in our oil production during 2013, we're now projecting an increase of 8% to 13%. In total, we expect liquids to represent about 50% of our production this year, that's another gain in our total liquid percentage, up from 48% last year.","To help get us to our full year projection, you've seen our Q2 guidance range of 667 million to 692 million a day, and what that's really reflecting is that ramp up of production I just mentioned from Q1 and most of that coming from the Permian.","Shifting gears to our OpEx. You may note that our Q1 LOE came in at $1.17 per Mcfe, that's up $0.11 from the fourth quarter and slightly above our 2012 average of $1.13. A couple of factors are coming into play here. We're seeing some increased compression costs, we've had increased power cost on our new wells, some higher chemical costs during the quarter associated with our early quarter freezing issues, just to name a few. But the largest factor was our increased workover activity, primarily in the Permian, which, by itself, added $0.10 per Mcfe over our 2012 average.","As we may have talked about before, as part of one of our 2013 company goals, our production group has put a strong emphasis on stepped-up well reviews and lease inspections to optimize the production from and the appearance of our wells. The attention that we're giving the wells comes at a cost, however, and as a result, we've revised our full year LOE guidance up just slightly from $1.10 to $1.22.","Just a few comments on service costs before turning the call over to John. On the drilling side, we'd characterize the market as stable with current day rates about where they were last call. But that's down about 3% to 5% from where they were in Q4. That said, however, we're seeing the benefits of some nice cost reductions, primarily in the Permian. The reductions that we've seen on the drilling side have been, I'll call them, performance-related rather than by market. With enhanced use of the PDC bits, tweaking our fluid designs, employing more use of downhaul motors and rotary steering technologies, we've cut down on our drilling days. On the completion side, we've realized some nice reductions as well, not only to a competitive market, but through more efficient operations, in addition. As a result, we're seeing meaningful cost reductions in our Bone Spring program, with our generic New Mexico Horizontal Second Bone Spring AFEs now running $6.3 million to $6.9 million. That's down about $200,000 from the numbers we've quoted last call. And our West Texas Second Bone Spring wells are now running $5.7 million, with them seeing the same benefits as well. The same goes for our West Texas Third Bone Spring AFEs, which are currently running around $6.4 million to $6.6 million. That's down $600,000 from our last call. We've really made some great progress in that program. Our Wolfcamp Horizontals are still running around $7 million to $7.5 million, about flat to where they were last call. But remember that those numbers are down more than $1 million from where they were 9 months ago. In Cana, our program drilling efficiencies continue to shave dollars off our AFEs, with our current estimates now running $6.9 million, down $100,000 from, again, what we quoted last call, which was 500 -- and we're $500,000 down from where we were 6 months ago.","We are very, very excited about the improvements we've made in our drilling program. Quite proud of our drilling team to accomplish what they've done, the results of which are certainly helping the economics of our program. All that said, we'll stay focused on demonstrating further improvement to get things better yet. So in summary, we've had another good quarter. Q1 production came in strong. Our guidance remains unchanged and continues to reflect an 8% to 13% increase in our production, and our drilling costs are certainly headed the right direction. So with that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John A. Lambuth","Thanks, Joe. I'll cover some of the specifics of our Permian and Mid-Continent drilling program. It's been a very busy first quarter for us. We drilled and completed 87 gross, 47 net wells during the first quarter.","I'm going to start first with an update on our Mid-Continent region. This quarter, we drilled and completed 52 gross, 20 net wells, essentially all of which were in the Cana-Woodford shale play. We continue with our infill Cana core drilling. This brings then our total well drilling in Cana to 532. We currently have 4 operated rigs working in Cana. We're still on track to drill and complete approximately 35 operated wells, and we will participate in 90 outside operated wells, with the majority of them being drilled by Devon.","Our drilling and completion capital is still projected to be around $350 million for this year. Certainly, a bit higher first quarter gas prices are a relief, and they are helping our Cana's projected returns, as are some of the cost reductions in our drilling completion that Joe just mentioned. Our Cana program is performing well, and we're working to minimize those costs and increase productivity to enhance our returns there.","Moving on to the Permian. The Permian region was our most active region as we drilled and completed 35 gross, 27 net wells during the first quarter. All of these were completed as producers. Our drilling has focused in the Delaware Basin of Texas and Southeast New Mexico, targeting the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations. Nearly half of our first quarter drilling was in our New Mexico Bone Spring program where we drilled and completed 18 gross, 11 net wells. We continue to have very strong results in this program. Our per well 30-day gross production from these wells averaged over 650 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with the majority of that 89% being oil. We also have had another solid quarter in our Ward County Texas Third Bone Spring program where we have drilled 7 gross, 6.5 net wells. These wells had a per well 30-day average gross production rate of over 970 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 77% of which was oil. For both of these programs, again, as Joe just mentioned, we're seeing significant reductions in our drilling and completion costs, which just leads to even better rate of returns that we're experiencing there.","We've also had an active Texas Bone Spring program -- sorry, as Tom mentioned, Culberson County, as well as what we call White City or Southern Eddy County has become a key area for us. We continue to have success drilling both in the Wolfcamp C and D intervals, as well as Second Bone Spring wells. And we see additional upside in the Wolfcamp A and the shallower Delaware sands. We drilled and completed 3 Wolfcamp and 3 Bone Spring wells this year. We now have 4 Bone Spring wells drilled to date in Culberson County, which have had a per-well 30-day average gross production of over 900 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 59% is oil. I'd like to mention here that of these 4 wells, one was a very significant step out to the Southern area in Culberson, away from where the existing wells have been drilled. That well has done a nice job of proving up additional areas for us to drill in Culberson.","The Wolfcamp wells now total 34 gross, 32 net in the area, and our per-well first 30-day production rates on all of the Wolfcamp wells drilled in the area to date have averaged 6.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, comprised of 43% gas, 27% oil and 30% NGL.","In addition to the Wolfcamp C and D interval, as well as the Second Bone Spring, we think there are additional opportunities on our Culberson acreage in both the Wolfcamp A interval as well as the shallower Delaware sand. We, in fact, plan to drill a Wolfcamp A test in Culberson later this year.","Some other things we're looking forward to trying include a dual completion of the Wolfcamp C and D. The Wolfcamp interval is the very thick interval, and we are fairly confident that the C and D are not basically communicating with each other. So we plan to drill a stacked lateral, one in the C and one in the D, to verify that indeed we get a unique reserves with each zone. With those results in hand, we will then plan our infill development program sometime probably in early part of next year.","Finally, a quick word on another area where we're drilling, Wolfcamp test, which is in Reeves County. We have one well that has been on production for a while now, and its results are extremely similar to other operator wells in the area. We're very excited about it. We have also now drilled a second well and have just finished completing it. It is just now in early stages of flowback. And we're now in the process of drilling our third well. We're very excited about this area so far, although there's still a lot to be determined based on future drilling as to how good it will eventually be for us.","Finishing up, I just want to say that we are off to a great start this year. Our teams are always focused on maximizing returns on our drilling, and they are doing a great job. Looking forward, we have a very significant opportunity set. Quite frankly, our prospect inventory has never been as rich as it is right now. In the Permian region itself, as we sit here today, we recognize between 200 to 300 Bone Spring sand locations, with further upside available for us in the Avalon on the same acreage. When we look at the Wolfcamp in Culberson White City, we see several thousand potential locations, that, of course, depending on our ultimate spacing that we determined based on our infill pilot, as well as whether or not how many stacked laterals we are able to drill within that interval. We, of course, also see potential for the shallow at Delaware and the deeper Cisco\/Canyon shale wells as well. We have huge amount of future drilling inventory in the Permian, not to mention the thousand of wells we have still yet to drill in Cana. Now with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Mario Barraza.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Just can you talk a little bit more about the Culberson County area? Where do you feel -- I know it's early days, but where do you feel these potential 5 zones could spread out? Do you think they're prospective across the entire 100,000 net acres you have here?","John A. Lambuth","Potential, yes. Can we definitively say that at this point? No. Obviously, future drilling will dictate that. What we do know is we certainly have established a good program in the Wolfcamp C and D today. Likewise, we here recently with the results have established at a very good 8 tack [ph] rate of return program in the Second Bone Spring. How far does it go? Well that's just a matter of further development drilling, stepped out drilling, which we have not achieved just yet. So the potential is there, but can we quantify that on all the acreage? At this point, I guess, I'd say the jury is out, but the potential is definitely there for a majority of those intervals.","Thomas E. Jorden","Mario, this is Tom. I don't think all zones will be prospective everywhere. So we're currently delineating and, of course, this is a big area and a very thick section. That Wolfcamp alone is 6,800 feet thick. We have the Second Bone Spring and then we have the Delaware above it. So given that area and that stratigraphic column, we have a lot of delineation still to do. Certainly, the C and D are fairly well calibrated, where we drilled it and we're still defining it. So we see the C and D as prospective overall, say, much of that acreage although that's still being defined. Whether that will support stacked laterals or not, we need to experiment. And then we haven't tested the Wolfcamp A in Culberson County. We haven't tested the Delaware at Culberson County. So not to be vague with our answer to your question, we certainly see -- it's not hard to do the arithmetic and get thousands of locations even on the down case here, but we're still defining the potential, and we don't have a lot of granularity as to how they will sum up.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","No, I appreciate that, the color you can provide today. And then Culberson isn't extremely populated. Do you guys have -- if you were to further accelerate the activity there heading into next year, are there any material infrastructure investments you still have to make here?","Thomas E. Jorden","Again, this is Tom. We've made infrastructure investments there over the last few years, and we got ahead of that, we saw the potential early on, and we are in very good shape from an infrastructure position. We've got our gathering system, we have a little processing plant we put in. We have multiple outlets for wet gas stream. There's still some infrastructure to be built as we keep pace with our drilling program. But we've got the infrastructure there that allows us by and large to control our own destiny. And so it was a very fortuitous decision we made 2 or 3 years ago to get ahead of that program and build that infrastructure.","Operator","The next question comes from Ryan Todd.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A question for you on CapEx. How should we think about CapEx and sensitivity to cash flow? So if commodity prices hold at current levels, should we think of the $1.5 billion number as a cap or would you consider spending more if you could still keep your borrowing under a certain limit?","Thomas E. Jorden","Ryan, this is Tom. We have flexibility there. We've not made any rules. We've provided guidance, but we've also been very clear saying that we're going to make decisions as we move forward. We have tremendous opportunity, not only in the Permian Basin which is, of course, the major focus, but we have some emerging opportunities in the Mid-Continent that we may want to fund this year. So our intent is certainly to stay within that capital guidance that we've laid out. But if we think we can get a great rate of return and it has downside protection to some commodity sensitivity, we wouldn't hesitate to go beyond what we've announced.","Paul Korus","This is Paul. Similarly, 3 months ago, we said our number would be 1.4 to 1.5. All we were simply doing there was allowing for weakness in the gas market in which case we might have tweaked back to 1.4. But I'll tell you, our number has always been right around 1.5, we just gave ourselves that flexibility back then. Where we sit today, we've kind of eliminated the down side case, and so our best estimate now is 1.5. If there's any bias, it would be higher. And by the same token, we gave wide enough production volume guidance to handle any of those cases. I mean, you can kind of drive a truck through our production volume guidance for the year. And that, of course, gives us plenty of wiggle room for things to go well. But it also allows for situations like well freeze offs, which we did experience. We are going into the suburb where we've seen ethane rejection and things like that. So we -- that's why we choose to give wide guidance as opposed to very narrow because a lot of things happen. And that way, we won't have to change guidance if they do.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's great. And you've seen some great -- I mean, it sounds like you've seen some great progress on reduction of well costs there. I mean, should we think of that as being -- are those well costs at the point now where they're below your official budget where you started the year and should we think that, for example, in the Permian, if you still spend the $900 million, that there could be upside to the actual number of wells drilled over the year?","Thomas E. Jorden","Ryan, the upside, there's a little bit of cost in there, and Joe went over that. But one of the things we're finding is we're drilling our wells much faster. Now generally that will translate into cost savings. But when you think about the components of drilling a well, you have your tangibles, your intangibles and your completion costs, and so drilling them faster doesn't really save on tangibles or completion costs. So what we're finding is that when we look at the Permian, we're drilling these wells significantly faster than we modeled. So we're getting a lot more done with the same rig fleet, and that's putting a little upward pressure on our capital, not downward pressure. So yes, we are seeing some cost savings, but mostly, we're seeing drilling time reduction. And so if we keep our current fleet and don't adjust, we'll probably be on that higher end.","Joseph R. Albi","And this is Joe. What I might add to that is for the same dollars, we'll drill more wells. So the positive side of that is more wells, more reserves, more production that comes along with it which affects our cash flow.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Magner.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Just I wanted to, I guess, follow up on the Cana program, with the rally we're seeing in gas prices and cost savings that you alluded to. Just curious where you are on decision, what to do with those rigs for the second half of the year.","John A. Lambuth","This is John Lambuth. As I said, we are at 4 rigs right now. But that said, in the immediate near future, we'll be going down to 2 rigs. But to be honest, that reduction in rig has more to do with just the overall infill development that's ongoing there. As we stated, there's kind of a ballet going on between us and the other operators to line up our sections in kind of an east-west sequence. And so right now, we don't want to keep the rigs because we get too far ahead versus what the other operators are doing. So the prudent thing for us is just to pull back a little, again, to work in concert with the others, and so that's what we're going to do for the remainder of the year with those 2 rigs. More than likely, as we enter next year, you'll probably see us come back with a couple of those rigs back into the program.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. And is there a plan to move those rigs to other opportunities in Mid-Continent or shift them over to the Permian? Has there been some discussion about that throughout the year?","John A. Lambuth","Well, we have sent one of the rigs down to the Permian. These rigs, we really, really like, as Joe mentioned, they've really done a phenomenal job for us in terms of drill rate, number of days. And so one of those rigs is moving down to the Permian, especially to help us with -- that rig's really built for longer laterals. So it's going down there to assist us with those type of wells. The other rig is one that we have released.","Joseph R. Albi","So what I might add there is that most -- all of these rigs that we've had in Cana, we've run for quite some time. So we've developed some efficiencies, we know how they work, they know how we work, to the extent we can keep them in our program, working within our budget, and as you mentioned, move them down to the Permian where we might take a 1,500-horsepower rig and put it into a situation -- or hydrated rig and put it down there where, even at a higher day rate, it's outperforming some of the other rigs, we're going to jump on that.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. I just wanted to clarify, the guidance for the year, did that include the potential, I guess, drop down to 2 rigs or was it a drop of all 4 rigs, and a shift for the second half? I just want to sort of be clear on what was included and how the current plan is.","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe, again. What that incorporates is our current projection for all of our rig activity. So to the extent we're going from 4 to 2, it's certainly in there.","John A. Lambuth","Yes, this is John. I'll just comment that regardless of 4 or 2, any of the wells we drill now in Cana don't even show up in this year's production. Basically, those wells will end up getting completed early first quarter. So really, it has no impact on this year's production guidance.","Thomas E. Jorden","That's correct. That have more of an impact on '14.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. And just on the plan to drill a dual stacked lateral, can you just talk about the impact on overall well costs relative to drilling 2 separate laterals. And any associated risks with that type of a well design that we should keep in mind?","John A. Lambuth","Well, this is John, again, and maybe I wasn't as clear as I needed to be. But those will be 2 independent wells, just side-by-side, where one would target the C zone, the other well would target the D. We're not talking about 2 laterals out of 1 bore hole. They will be 2 independent wells targeting each independent zone. Is that clear?","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Yes, that's helpful. Okay. I'll leave it there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gil Yang [ph].","Unknown Analyst","Just going back to well cost, and I apologize if you have addressed this. But if you look at your -- in the presentation, if you look at the E&D budget versus the net wells. The wells are more expensive in the Permian this year than last year. Is that just the budget, and we should expect that those well costs should be down from it or...","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, there are a couple of elements there. One, we're drilling more long lateral horizontal wells. So our well complexion is more expensive, we're drilling more Wolfcamp wells. We've got a very active Third Bone Spring program, and those are a little more expensive wells. We're also drilling few Yeso wells this year. So those -- if you look at our well count in the prior years, they've had a fair amount of those $2 million, $2.2 million vertical wells. And there are very few of those in this year's program. So a lot of that difference in average well costs is made up by the types of wells we're drilling, not necessarily a change in cost.","Unknown Analyst","Got you. Okay. So the change in cost you're talking about is sort of apples-to-apples cost changes and this is a mix issue that the wells themselves are...","Thomas E. Jorden","That's right.","Unknown Analyst","Yes, okay. Got you. And then just following up on in terms of the Permian. In Culberson, do you have any drill to depths -- or hold to depth issues that will induce you to drill to the deeper horizons first?","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, that's certainly a part of our overall strategy there. And one of the things that we did, we got it down in the Culberson. When we started putting this acreage together in 2006, at that time, our primary objective was the Penn Shale or locally it's called the Cisco Canyon. And that's a nice productive interval. We drilled some wells, made some nice completions in that, both in Eddy County, we have fair amount of experience. But it's dry. Although it's an economic objective at current cost and current gas prices, it's not something we're pursuing. So then we've moved to the Wolfcamp, and on our drill to hold, we're holding at least to the basin of Wolfcamp. And we're looking at lease by lease. Some leases hold the entire Wolfcamp, some leases, it's depth drill. And we've got a fairly complex analysis on where we need to drill. But we're definitely attempting to hold the deepest producing Wolfcamp horizon and everything shallower. So that does color our drilling strategy. We get asked a lot, why don't you guys do Wolfcamp A? Well, we are, but we're kind of fitting that in with wells that are targeting the D and C to hold those deep rights.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. So in some cases, you need to drill the Wolfcamp E to hold the whole thing. But in some cases, if you drill the Wolfcamp A, you can hold A, C, D, E?","Thomas E. Jorden","That's correct. Now we don't have -- we only have 1 Wolfcamp E test in Culberson County. That was a vertical test for a conventional reservoir, and that was unsuccessful. So currently, our deepest horizontal objective is the Wolfcamp D.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And with your Penn drilling, Penn Shale drilling, did you hold a sufficient amount of acreage or is that pretty de minimis?","Thomas E. Jorden","Not in Culberson County. That's de minimis.","Unknown Analyst","So overall, how much is held by production at this point?","Thomas E. Jorden","For Penn Shale or for overall?","Unknown Analyst","Probably just overall. For the Wolfcamp, ultimately which you're targeting now.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, we don\u2019t have that. John is guessing 1\/3. I don\u2019t -- we don't have that number readily available but we can get that for you.","John A. Lambuth","Yes, I can tell you that we are on a capital program, that we've identified the minimum amount of capital we have to send in Wolfcamp drilling, and we're on a path to hold everything or essentially everything that we see as prospective. And that minimum amount, I think, was 125 million this year. It will be between 225 million and 250 million next year. And then it steps back down to the 100s for the year following. So without inordinate amount of capital, we're going to be able to hold all those Wolfcamp rights.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. So it's not going to govern your CapEx program at the levels we're at?","Thomas E. Jorden","I'm sorry, Gil?","Unknown Analyst","So it won't govern -- it won't moderate or attenuate your program, given where we are today?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, it's -- yes, I wouldn't say it will moderate or attenuate, it certainly is an overprint. And right now, we have 2 rigs drilling Wolfcamp wells. With those 2 rigs, we can get this done. We will add a rig or 2 next year. But we did add, in addition to our 2 Wolfcamp rigs, we brought in 2 additional rigs to drill Second Bone Spring wells in Culberson County. And that was completely additive, that was without regard to the acreage holding to depth, and that was just because those Second Bone Spring wells are delivering lights out rates of return. But we're going to get those Wolfcamp rights held just fine.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Gamble.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","I wanted to focus on the production side for a minute. I think Paul had alluded to it, the continued wide, I guess, train-size gap you've got for loan in high end of production. Is it safe to assume that with the...","Thomas E. Jorden","That was a truck, that was not train, that was a truck.","Paul Korus","It was a truck.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","A truck, sorry. I'm sorry, Paul. I didn't mean to put words in your mouth. We'll call it truck-size hole. At $1.5 billion and with all the success that you've been having, it seems like you're saying that the upper end makes more sense than the lower end, is that a fair assumption at this point?","Paul Korus","We make no such assumptions. Like Yogi Berra said, forecasting is difficult, especially when it has to do with something in the future. And we don't know what's going to happen with ethane rejection over the upcoming months. And that always has an impact on our NGL volumes, we get a little uplift in gas volumes. But net-net, it's a negative on production volumes. We don't know whether we're going to experience that in 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months. It's not predictable.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And that production gap right now includes how much rejection over the next few months?","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe. What we built into it is about 10 million or 11 million a day potential ethane rejection here during Q2. Now we don't know what it's going to be in Q3 so we didn't model that. But the other thing Paul is alluding to is there are some risks with takeaway capacity, particularly in the Permian that we're concerned about. We're seeing lower recoveries from the processing facilities that we're sending our gas to. We hope that, that's alleviated come Q3 with additional NGL takeaway coming into play from Sandhills. So all that being said, we're trying to forecast what we know right now with regard to recoveries in ethane rejection. To the extent it improves, I guess, it could bump the number up a little bit. But we're kind of modeling the world as we see now, and that midpoint of that range that I will call the Nissan small truck can drive through, that we feel like we can certainly attain.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","But you're never going to drive Nissans in Texas, come on now.","Joseph R. Albi","Well, they're smaller trucks.","Paul Korus","And in the Permian, as Joe mentioned, when the recoveries go down or one of the processors we go to is at capacity, one of the very smart things that has been done is that we have another outlet for the gas, for the wet gas. We may all end up regretting going to 3 stream reporting someday as an industry because these processed volumes of NGLs can really change, whereas our produced in metered volumes do not. So we may take a wet gas stream to a market because we can when we're shut out of capacity to process. Our produced volumes on a wet gas basis remain the same. But the way we count production from a reporting purpose, the way we all model it and what not, look different. So again, there's so many moving parts that -- my goodness, it's only May. To leave enough room or a wide enough production volume guidance is what we think is appropriate to do. As we get to the latter half of the year, as always, we'll tighten it down some.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then one other clarification point on that, you mentioned the 7 Mcf that was down during Q1. I'm assuming that a part of this ongoing saga that is downtime and what's up and what gets rejected, that 7 has carried over into Q2 to some extent?","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe. What we've seen, and I don't have the numbers right handy right in front of me now, but as you may recall last year, in particular in the Permian, things are getting tight. So we have seen 3 million up to 15 million a day type impacts on a particular month due to either turnaround or takeaway issues. The first quarter was really hit a little bit harder with the weather, and we have a lot of freezing issues, in particular on the Triple Crown facility that came into play there. So to the extent it's incurred, we don't necessarily sit up there and say, okay, let's just subtract 4 million or 5 million a day here or there. We're trying to forecast what we know we're seeing consistently, and we're not counting on bad things to happen, we're also not counting on great things to happen.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And then one more for me. Different topic, on the AFEs. Now correct me if I'm wrong, you rolled through them pretty quickly, but the best quarter-on-quarter change was in the Third Bone Spring's number down to 6.4 to 6.6 on AFEs. Was there anything specific that caused that 600k improvement quarter-on-quarter that either could potentially be rolled into the other wells or any other zones or was that just happened to be a great quarter?","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe again. There are things that we're doing in the Third Bone that we certainly hope to carry forward into where I'd say our next viable target is, obviously, the Wolfcamp. Without getting into the specifics of it, it really just means cross-pollinating technologies between the different groups in our drilling department, whether it be in Tulsa or the Permian, but be a little bit aggressive with our use of PDC bits, motors, our hole design, we're testing different fluids. And to the extent they work in one program and we're in the same darn area, I think you'll see us trying to apply it elsewhere.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Portillo.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a few quick questions from me. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of clarity on your Wolfcamp C and D results, if there's any difference in the liquids yields that you're seeing at this point. And as you move forward with that drilling campaign, is there a preferred interval that you're targeting from here?","John A. Lambuth","This is John. Yes, so far within Culberson County, between the C and D, we do see a difference in the liquid content. And that as we move up in the section, from the D to the C, we definitely get richer in terms of our condensate NGL. Going forward, we still have our very -- and we will still make very good rate of returns in the D. And so as someone mentioned earlier, in terms of HBP in our acreage, we're always cognizant of making sure we're at least holding the deepest interval by HBP for future drilling. Furthermore, because of that change we see going from D to C, that kind of gives us encouragement in what we potentially might see when we finally get this A test done later this year. I mean, that has the potential to be even more liquids rich interval, but that said, we won't know until we actually get that well drilled.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","As we think about kind of the wells we've seen so far, kind of in the 45% gas range, could you give us, I guess, maybe just a little bit of color around what the gas to liquids yield might be on the C? Just trying to get a better sense of what the liquids yield.","John A. Lambuth","Well, of course there's a wide variation, it's a big area. But on average, in the D, I would say, we're seeing condensate that comes in between 80 and 100 barrels per million. Our recent wells are probably in the higher end of that range out of the D. We have some C wells that are significantly higher than that. In fact, we have a C well that's 200 barrels per million condensate. So we see much richer stream out of the C. That's also a reason why we suspect that they are independent reservoirs. They are 150 to 200 feet apart and that stacked lateral will be a really seminal test for us because we're strongly suspecting that they'll be able to be developed as completely independent horizontal targets, but we don't have that experiment yet.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And just on your Wolfcamp A result, you mentioned that the initial well result there was very encouraging. Could you give us some color on how we should think about the IP rate? I think you guys have a 30-day IP there. And maybe how we should think about the liquids yield on the Wolfcamp A in Reeves County.","Thomas E. Jorden","Again, this is Tom. I was expecting earlier in the call we'd be grilled on the Wolfcamp A in Reeves County. So here's what we'll say about it. First off, this is a very competitive area. It's a big area and it's a competitive area. And so we're still out there competing for opportunity, and we're probably going to disappoint a lot of listeners in that we're not going to give granular detail on individual well results. A lot of other companies are and we listen to those carefully, and I will tell you that we're seeing results that are very consistent with what's being discussed in the industry. Wolfcamp A is an emerging target in Reeves County, we're very high on it. We are in the midst of a competitive leasing environment, and it's a major focus of ours. I will also say that we have plans to spend at least $160 million a year drilling Wolfcamp A targets over the next 2 years. And obviously, it's high in our list. But we're just not, at this point, it's just not in the interest of Cimarex shareholders for us to be giving detailed well-by-well results at this time.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then just my last question on your emerging liquids plays, I was wondering if there's any update there. Or how many wells have you guys have tested and maybe when we should expect to get some color on the results you guys have seen?","John A. Lambuth","This is John. Really no update, per se. I mean, we continue to look for new opportunities, as we've said. But just like we just had a discussion on Wolfcamp A, typically we're fairly conservative in talking about new plays, and we just don't have anything to say about any new opportunity for us right now. Are we pursuing them? Absolutely. We have a number of things in the hopper that we're looking at, formulating plans, potentially drilling, but really nothing that I can give any color to today.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, I'll probably go a step further there. We had a couple of projects which we talked about in vague terms. One, I'll tell you, we think is not going to work. The second one, we're currently in the process of drilling in. It's our third well on the play, and we'll say a little more about it in the future.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Gail Nicholson.","Gail A. Nicholson - KLR Group Holdings, LLC, Research Division","I just was kind of curious on the longer lateral that you're drilling in the Permian. If you could give any color on what you're seeing there and is that kind of, I guess, the way you're going to kind of drill these wells in the future.","John A. Lambuth","This is John. Well, we're very early in terms of our long lateral drilling. We have a number of examples in some of the different intervals. And although we are encouraged by what we see out of those, there are some things we have to overcome. Cost. Drilling longer laterals, it definitely takes more money. But that said, we definitely see for a number of plays where longer laterals is probably where we are headed. Now again, that's also a matter of acreage, what we have available to us, where we can drill those longer laterals. But I would say, it would not surprise me in the coming year or 2, that you're going to see more and more of our program go -- head more toward those greater than 5,000-foot type laterals. I think that's a fair statement.","Thomas E. Jorden","We just don't know yet. We did drill a long lateral in Culberson County, a Wolfcamp D lateral. The Delaware Basin is different than the Midland Basin. And certainly, we're well aware of the long laterals in the Midland Basin and the logic behind those, cost savings improvement that they observe. Delaware Basin, we're deeper and we're more pressured. And both those work against long laterals. Our long lateral in Culberson is kind of a betweener, as far as -- it's a good well, but does it justify taking that risk to drill a long lateral? We're kind of on the fence there. We do have a long lateral in Reeves County that we haven't completed yet. And we just don't know. So we're very much interested in looking at long laterals as a way to increase our returns. But it's a little more complex than that because we are deeper and more pressured and that can lead to mechanical problems and there can be a situation where you say it's just not worth messing with.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeb Bachmann.","Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","It's just a quick one for me on kind of looking forward towards year end. First, looking back at year end '12, you guys didn't have any PUD bookings in the Permian, and looking forward to the end of this year, just wondering kind of what's your philosophy is regarding that. I don't believe you have a down spacing pilot in the Wolfcamp yet. But looking at the Bone Spring, just kind of any color you guys can provide on that.","Joseph R. Albi","Yes, this is Joe. I'd say we'll give you the same answer as I believe we gave last call. Cana, by far, has lent itself to the PUD bookings because we felt very comfortable in the pilot project that we have done and with our infill projects. So it lent itself to PUD bookings. We don't know the spacing on the Wolfcamp. I'll just take it as an example that we'll drill down to. So without a pilot, you won't see us just jumping out and booking a bunch of PUDs there. To the extent the Bone Spring is call bookable, those locations are kind of one leads to the next to the next to the next. And with that, it doesn't lend itself to a broad booking of PUD reserves. If we can get a pilot under our belts in the Wolfcamp, I certainly see us being in a position where we're going to feel comfortable doing that. And then most importantly, we're very strict about the 5-year rule with the SEC. What we book, we want to make sure we can drill within the 5 years. So to the extent it plays into our overall budget, it's going to have a role in their decision as well.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, Jeb, what we will probably do here, as we get into the year, in the Permian, we'll probably do exactly what we did at Cana. Rather than go aggressive on PUD booking, we'll choose to be just more forthcoming of the inventory as we see it. And then let the investing public value it as they will. But we do take a fairly conservative viewpoint on actually booking PUDs, as Joe mentioned, for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is the 5-year rule. But we'll be more forthcoming, I think, on what we see our future investment potential.","Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","And Tom, do you guys have an idea yet when you'd actually drill that down spacing pilot in the Wolfcamp?","Thomas E. Jorden","It won't be this year. This year, what we are hoping to do is, one, get a Wolfcamp A and get a Wolfcamp C, D stacked lateral. But while we're -- I'd like to say next year, it will be on our list. We fully recognize that it's to our benefit to understand that spacing early on the play, not later. But right now, Jeb, we don't have it on the docket. It's not on our rig schedule.","Operator","Your next question comes from Cameron Horwitz.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Tom, I know you don\u2019t want to get into specifics on Reeves. But can you just give us the -- where you guys are in terms of HBP-ing that acreage and what you have to do to maintain that? I think you were at 35,000 acres there.","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, we've only drilled a few wells. So you can kind of do your math there, that 160 million a year is to hold our acreage. So we're going to get after it, and our plan today is to hold that acreage primarily with Wolfcamp A drilling. I think that answers your question.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","It does, yes. And then just in terms of the well cost, do you expect well cost there to be similar to Wolfcamp [indiscernible]?","Thomas E. Jorden","So far, that's our viewpoint. I mean, we're looking forward to getting that drill time and cost down, but right now, a Wolfcamp A AFE, we see a 7, 7.2.","John A. Lambuth","Yes, this is John. It is right in the mid-7 range right now. But again, we're early in that play. So like any other play, we expect that to come down as we drill more of those wells.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","Thomas E. Jorden","Thank you, everyone, for joining us today on the call. We look forward to seeing you in the future conferences, and report back to you next quarter. Thanks a lot. Talk to you later. Bye.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. This concludes today's program.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Burford, Vice President, Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Burford","Thank you very much, Denise, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our second quarter conference call. On the call today here in Denver, we have Tom Jorden, President, CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; and John Lambuth, Vice President, Exploration.","We did issue our financial and operating results this morning. A copy of our news release can be found on our website. And I need to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed. And you should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K, other filings and news releases for risks associated with our business. So we had a good quarter this quarter and a lot of details to cover, so I'll just go ahead and turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden","Thank you, Mark. Welcome, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Cimarex. I'd like to take a few minutes to go over the highlights of the quarter before turning the call over to Joe and John for a more detailed look at our operations.","We had a solid second quarter. Production averaged 687 million cubic feet equivalent per day, slightly ahead of our expectations. This represents growth of 16% over second quarter 2012. Our oil production increased an even greater 29%, averaging 36,878 barrels per day this quarter.","Capital expenditures totaled $390 million, funded principally from our $322 million in cash flow from operating activities, $44 million in proceeds from asset sales and $22 million in bank debt. We still expect to invest about $1.5 billion in 2013 on high rate of return projects, primarily in the Delaware Basin portion of the Permian Basin and on the Cana-Woodford Shale. Our Permian program continues to provide great returns, and that's where we'll invest $950 million or about 63% of our capital this year.","Our results have been particularly positive in the Horizontal Wolfcamp. In our Culberson County focus area, we signed a joint development agreement with Chevron, which greatly enhances the future development plan for this significant resource. We've also had encouraging results in the Wolfcamp and Reeves County, where 2 new wells had first 30-day production rates averaging 925 barrel of oil equivalent per day.","It's -- ultimately, it's about execution and making sure that each of our major programs is performing. And how do we define performance? After-tax rate of return, maximizing net present value and building a portfolio that exposes Cimarex to profitable long-term growth. Ultimately, the long-term becomes a series of quarterly results, and results are what we like to talk about.","There's been a lot of buzz this week around the Delaware Basin-Wolfcamp play. On this call, you'll hear about some of our excellent recent results in this trend in some detail. As we studied our results and studied those of our competitors, we've reassessed and enlarged our estimate of the potential this play holds for Cimarex. John will discuss these results and opportunities in more detail later in the call.","We remain focused on ways to improve our returns in each of our areas. We've made wonderful strides in our drilling cost and drilling days, and we have opportunities to optimize, experiment and improve our completions. We also continue to generate new ideas with good long-term growth potential. We have an active leasing program underway in the Permian Basin and elsewhere, a leasing program that's grounded in our discipline of full-cycle return on invested capital. Cimarex is having a good year, we had a good second quarter, and we're looking forward to discussing it in detail on this call.","Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Joe Albi.","Joseph R. Albi","Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all of you, for joining our call today. I'll touch on our second quarter production, update you on our third quarter guidance projections, and then follow up with a few words on our operating and service costs.","As Tom mentioned, we had a good strong second quarter, with reported net equivalent daily volumes coming in at 686.7 million equivalent cubic feet per day, that's above the midpoint of our guidance of 667 million and -- to 692 million and up 16% over last year. When adjusting for our 2012 year-end property sale, we were up 19% as compared to 2012.","We achieved this production growth despite seeing about 9 million to 10 million a day of downtime during the quarter, that being associated with ethane rejection in various plant and facility shut-ins, primarily in Permian and in Cana. If you look deeper into the numbers, our second quarter Mid-Continent volume came in at 343.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day, up 14% or 43 million a day from Q2 '12. The increase was driven by Cana, which grew 38% year-over-year to 216.1 million a day during Q2 '13.","That said, due primarily to ethane rejection and a lull in our second quarter Cana completion activity, our second quarter Mid-Continent production fell 5% from Q1 '13, where we reported a level of 360.6 million a day. With both our operated and non-operated Cana completion activity picking up steam again here during the second half of the year, we're projecting our Cana volumes to see an upward trend starting here -- later in Q3 and extending into Q4.","In the Permian, our second quarter net equivalent volume of 319.6 million a day was up 29% or 72 million a day from a year ago. Our growth in the Permian has been driven all by oil. With Q2 Permian oil production averaging 30,137 barrels a day, that's up 8,113 barrels a day or 39% from last year. As compared to the first quarter of '13, our Permian net equivalent volume was up 44 million a day or 16%, while our net Permian oil volume was up an incremental 4,305 barrels a day, which exceeded Q1 by 17%.","Jumping to guidance. Despite reducing our Q3 '13 projected volumes by approximately 12 million to 15 million a day for ethane rejection, the midpoint for our full year 2013 production range remains unchanged from our previous guidance of 690 million a day. Our tightened full year guidance range of 680 million to 700 million a day reflects a 9% to 12% increase over 2012, which when we adjust for property sales, equates to a healthy 11% to 14% year-over-year production growth.","With ethane rejection built into our Q3 guidance, our forecasted Q3 NGL volumes have been reduced by about 2,500 barrels a day. That said, the projected drop in NGLs is being offset by higher forecasted oil production from the Permian. Our year-to-date Permian drilling results continued to exceed our original program projections. And as a result, we've revised our total company projected year-over-year increase in oil production, now twice during the year. From 1% to 5% at the beginning of the year to 13% in our last quarter call, and now to a respectable 13% to 16% increase over 2012.","Shifting gears to OpEx. Our second quarter lifting cost came in at $1.11 per Mcfe, that's down $0.06 from our first quarter cost of $1.17 per Mcfe. During the quarter, our production team did a very nice job of keeping our total LOE in check. With that, however, we continue to see cost pressure in certain areas such as compression, power and fuel rework and maintenance, particularly, in light of our 2013 emphasis on stepping up our well reviews and lease inspections in order to optimize our production from, and the appearance of, our wells.","With Q2 coming in at $1.11, our first half 2013 lifting cost comes in at $1.13 per Mcfe, and as such, we've made no change to our previous full year guidance range of $1.10 to $1.22 and see ourselves as having a good chance of coming in on the low end of that range by the end of the year.","On the service cost side, with regard to drilling costs, we continue to see most cost compliments remain relatively in check. Day rates have held flat during the quarter. Although we are seeing signs of the softening market, with rig availability and offered well-to-well contracts, versus the term contracts, we saw, let's say, a year ago.","In the Permian, although a high demand for tools and equipment can sometimes create a challenge, we've been able to procure that equipment, those services, all the while seeing our costs continue to remain flat. Through operating efficiencies, as Tom mentioned, we've made some good strides in our drilling program, and it's reflected itself in our drilling cost, especially in the Permian, where we've made slight modifications to program design and implemented more aggressive use of bit technology and downhole tools, which has really allowed us to reduce our drilling days.","On the completion cost side, we've seen signs of market softening in the Permian, particularly, in the Delaware now, with more available horsepower and competition amongst the service providers. And as a result, our second quarter average, overall, per well Permian frac cost is down about 20% from Q1.","The bottom line of all this is continued improvement in our Permian total well cost. Depending on debt, our current New Mexico 2nd Bone Spring AFEs are running $6.1 million to $6.7 million, that's down about $200,000 from last quarter. Our shallower Texas 2nd Bone Spring AFEs are running about $5.3 million to $5.5 million, that's down $200,000 to $400,000 from the numbers we quoted last call. And our Culberson-Wolfcamp wells are running flat to last quarter at $7 million to $7.5 million total well cost. That's down $1 million from where it was a year ago. And our West Texas 3rd Bone Spring AFEs, also held flat from Q1 at $6.4 million to $6.6 million. Again, that's down considerably from late last year.","In Cana, our program drilling has kept our total well cost in check. They're running about $6.8 million, $6.9 million, that's down about a $0.5 million from last year. The bottom line is we've made good strides to get our well costs down. And along the way, we've set some milestones we're proud of in our active programs, which we believe are competing well with our peers.","So in a nutshell, Tom talks about results. I mentioned 3 of them in our call here today. Our production continues to grow. It's a positive result. We've trimmed our lifting costs down during Q2, likewise, and have made some tremendous strides in controlling and reducing our drilling and completion cost. All of these are certainly pointing in what we believe to be the right direction.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John Lambuth, our Vice President of Exploration.","John A. Lambuth","Thanks, Joe. I'll cover some of the specifics of our Permian and Cana drilling programs. We had an active first half of 2013. We've completed 179 gross, 95 net wells this year, investing $800 million in exploration and development capital. 65% of our capital was invested in the Permian basin, while 33% with the Mid-Continent region.","We still expect our total annual exploration development capital to be approximately $1.5 billion for 2013. As planned, our capital investment has been front-end loaded this year.","In the second half of the year, our Cana capital will be down slightly as a result of going from 4 to 2 rigs. Also in Culberson County, our capital will be lower in the second half as a result of the joint development agreement we signed with Chevron.","I'm going to first start with our Mid-Continent region. This year, we've drilled and completed 87 gross, 35 net Mid-Continent wells, essentially, all of which were in the Cana-Woodford shale play. In Cana, we've drilled and completed 74 gross, 31 net wells, most of which have been operated by our partners. We currently have 2 operated rigs working in Cana. Including non-operated activity, we're on track to drill and complete slightly more than 50 net wells this year.","Our Cana capital is projected to be just over $350 million for this year, of which, about approximately $250 million would be attributable to the nonoperating part for the program. Our returns in Cana for this year are tracking about where we expected in the mid to low 20% after-tax internal rate of return.","I'm going to move on now to the Permian Basin. Permian Basin is our most active area. We've drilled and completed 90 gross, 59 net Permian basin wells this year. Most of our drilling has been focused on the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations in the Delaware Basin. We've had a very active New Mexico Bone Spring program, where we've drilled and completed 42 gross, 23 net wells. This program continues to deliver very strong results for us. Our per-well first 30-day gross production from these wells averaged approximately 650 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which, 85% was oil.","In our Ward County, Texas 3rd Bone Spring program, we drilled 21 gross, 15 net wells, with a per-well first 30-day average gross production rate of approximately 965 barrels of oil equivalent per day. These wells were 80% oil of that production. This program also continues to deliver great results for us.","I'm going to now move on over to our Culberson County, Texas focus area. As Tom mentioned, Culberson County and our adjoining acreage in Southern Eddy County, New Mexico has become a key area for us. We continue to drill Wolfcamp C and D, as well as 2nd Bone Spring wells here in this area. We also still see additional upside in the Wolfcamp Bay, as well as the shallower Delaware Sand interval.","Year-to-date, we've drilled 9 gross, 6 net Bone Spring wells, which have had a per-well first 30-day average gross production of 850 barrels of oil equivalent per day and were 58% oil. We currently have 2 rigs drilling 2nd Bone Spring wells in this area. Depths are less than 8,000 feet, and we're able to drill these wells in about 20 days. Well costs are now around $5.3 million to $5.5 million. These wells, with that type of well cost, generate great returns, as good as any of our Bone Spring drilling program throughout the Delaware Basin.","Moving onto the Wolfcamp. We've drilled 8 gross, 6 net horizontal Wolfcamp wells in Culberson County in 2013. This brings total wells in the area to 39 gross, 35 net, per-well first 30-day production rates on all of the Wolfcamp wells drilled to date in this area have averaged 6.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day comprised of 43% gas, 27% oil and 30% NGL, assuming full NGL recovery.","At the end of the second quarter, we signed a joint development agreement with Chevron. This agreement will enable us to be more efficient in our field development, as well as enable us to start drilling long laterals. In fact, regarding long laterals, earlier this year, we drilled a 7,500-foot extended lateral, which achieved the first 30-day IP rate of 8.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We have about 5 months of production history on this well, and we expect about a 50% after-tax rate of return based on the results we see. Because of this well, as well as now having that Chevron JDA in place, we are now planning a 10,000-foot lateral we'll be drilling in the third quarter of this year. We also continue to plan a Wolfcamp D downspacing pilot, which now looks like it will probably begin in the first quarter of 2014.","Moving on the Reeves County, Texas. We drilled and completed 2 Wolfcamp Bay wells. The first 30-day production rates were 983 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 865 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This production is comprised of 63% oil, 20% NGL and 17% gas. These are really good wells with 30-day averages of 600 barrels of oil per day plus another few hundred barrels equivalent of NGLs and gas. We have also now drilled a 2-mile lateral in Reeves County, which we recently finished frac-ing, and we're currently in the process of flowing back. Our plan is to drill an additional 5 Wolfcamp wells in Reeves County over the remainder of this year.","So wrapping it up, we're having a great year. Our team, as always, are focused on maximizing returns on our drilling, and they are doing a great job. As we stand now, we see at least 200 to 300 remaining Bone Spring Sand locations in Texas and New Mexico, with further upside for the Avalon in New Mexico.","As for the Wolfcamp, we have a very strong land position. If you look at the Wolfcamp trend going from our Southern Eddy County Culberson area, and then move over into Reeves and further into Ward County, we have over 170,000 net acres under lease. Quite frankly, that number could actually even be bigger just based on some of the more recent results that we're seeing from other companies.","Narrowing into our Culberson and Southern Eddy County area, which accounts for around 100,000 net acres of the 170,000 that I mentioned, we have significant future potential there. Depending on spacing and whether we require multiple stack laterals, there could be several thousand locations just in this area. And then moving back in the Reeves County, where we have over 40,000 acres, we've seen some very encouraging results from our first 2 wells we've drilled, and thus, there could be ultimately hundreds of locations located just in this area as well.","In summary, we have a huge amount of future drilling locations in the Permian Basin, not to mention the thousands of wells we still have to drill yet in the Cana area as well. Now with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Phil Jungwirth of BMO Capital Markets.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The oil cut in the 2 Reeves County wells was a little bit higher than what I think a lot of us expected, given some of the industry results to date. What would you attribute that to? And then do you expect to see much variability in the GOR across your 40,000 acres?","John A. Lambuth","Well, let's keep in mind, it is only 2 wells, and they are fairly close to each other geographically. Whereas there's a wide distribution of wells that never reported [ph] over a broad area. So I think it's safe to say that as we drill more wells, there will certainly be variability in that GOR. I don't know that we really have it dialed down yet, that we understand it just yet. But again, I think, what you're seeing is some of the variability over a broad geographic area, so far.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then on your Ward-Winkler County area acreage, where you've historically targeted the 3rd Bone Spring, we've had some industry results also targeting the Wolfcamp last week. Do you have rights to the Wolfcamp? And if so, do you have any plan to test that later this year or next year?","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, this is Tom. The answer is, we have fairly significant exposure to the Wolfcamp in that area. As John said, we've revised our acreage numbers upward to our exposure in that trend. And a lot of that revision is based on some of those recent industry results. So the answer is yes, we do have exposure, and we do have plans to test and develop it.","Operator","The next question will come from Brian Gamble of Simmons & Company.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Just wanted to actually just stay on that first topic for a second. The Reeves wells, you mentioned 5 more this year, these first 2 being pretty close together. Is there going to be more geographic variability from the remaining 5? Or are they all going to be pretty close together this year, and then spread out as we go forward?","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, Brian, this is Tom. One of the interesting things that we really like about the Permian Basin is it's not a basin where you have to create every new data point. You have a lot of competition helping you out. And there's been a lot of results that have been announced by our competitors out there. And if you take our acreage position and you plot all the other results that have been announced, it really does help define our position. The oil cut is encouragingly high for much of Reeves County. The GOR changes, a fair amount, as you go across from east to west, but based on our other industry competitors, we're going to be testing a fair amount of our geography. But we feel pretty confident that now, if we just talk about Reeves County, our acreage is in several different pockets, but we have a fairly concentrated acreage position in Reeves County, we're currently up over 40,000 net acres, we're adding to it. We're in the process of developing takeaway solutions. And that's worked its underway there. But we're planning on -- we see most of that acreage -- in fact, I'll say most, if not all, of that acreage, is pretty well delineated by our drilling and that of our competitors. Now we'd prefer to be talking about our own results and not those of our competitors, but we're pretty encouraged by how that points to our acreage.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","That's great. And then the oil growth, obviously, great for the quarter, seeing it bump up a couple of times this year already, obviously, is good as well. What sort of expectations for the back half of the year baked into the new guidance. Are you expecting continued improvement, because it seems like it's difficult not to continue to improve that. Is that 13% to 16% a conservative number on your viewpoint? Or does it give you room for -- or the need to continue to grow that -- to hit that number for the year, as far as what you're seeing on results?","Mark Burford","This is Mark Burford. We have been undershooting what we expected or hope growth will be for the year. Pretty consistently, we continue to try to retune that up and make it more fine. We're not trying to sandbag our numbers, but we do expect continued good growth in the Permian in the second half of the year, and, hence, good consistent growth in oil as part of that -- being a big part of that program. So I mean, I don't think the 4,000 barrels a day we grew from the first to second will trail in the second half. That was a pretty normally high growth rate first or second. But we should see a good continual growth in order for us to hit that new upward band of our 13% kind of growth -- 13%, 16% gross for oil. So we should see good growth second half of the year, Brian.","Operator","Our next question will come from Joe Magner of Macquarie Capital.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","I just wondered if you might be able to dive into some of the results that you're seeing out of the Culberson County-Wolfcamp C and D. It looks like the -- at least some the statistics you've provided in the release have moved around a little bit over the last couple of quarters. I'm just curious if you can maybe discuss some of the relative performance between those 2 different zones?","John A. Lambuth","This is John. I think what you're seeing is we keep showing the averages, and of course, as we drill additional wells, those averages change. I think also what you're seeing is both on those averages, whether we're in C or D, but also just geographic, we are still stepping out in some ways in part of Culberson. And sometimes the step outs are very good, and sometimes they're not as good, and that does affect the average overall performance there. In terms of just C and D itself, we definitely see a higher yield, a higher NGL content in the C relative to the D. But I would also say that we're still kind of early. We don't have as many D wells as we do C, and we're still trying to just get a better handle on what that ultimate production will be like in the D and -- I mean, excuse me, in the C. We're far more comfortable with the D wells, because that's where the majority of our wells have been so far. It still looks good. It's just -- we still need a few more wells online to get a better feel for how good the C will be relative to the D.","Thomas E. Jorden","Joe, this is Tom. If I could just add to what John said. We've talked in the past about the C being higher yield but lower absolute rates because of that yield. So some of that is an overprint of a mixture of C and D results. We're still seeing very good returns out of both those benches. One of the things, I talked to my opening remarks about completion optimization. And we're really just at the advent of a lot of opportunity in this trend. Our wells have still been essentially for garden variety 5,000 foot lateral, we're pumping 12 stages. And we need to -- we do have plans to experiment with more stages. And I think that we yet, couldn't pound the table on any bench as to what we think it's ultimate potential's going to be. It's a very fixed section. There's tremendous resource in place, and we have a lot of work yet to do. I'm sure somebody is going to ask us about the Wolfcamp A in Culberson County. We still don't have our well down and completed yet, so it's drilling now. And that's another very seminal test for us in defining the potential of the area. So very encouraging results, but we yet are still calibrating the ultimate potential of this area.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Good. I guess with my one follow up. Any plans, I guess, what are the latest plans of timing on when you might drill a stacked C and D lateral, like those and other testing initiatives that you had talked about pursuing?","John A. Lambuth","Yes, this is John. The stacked C and D lateral is scheduled to be drilled in the fourth quarter of this year. We have a location picked, and we are moving forward with that. And so that will be drilled in the fourth quarter with completion flowback. We really won't be able to say much about that until probably second quarter next year, but we are moving ahead with that for sure.","Operator","Our next question will come from Matt Portillo with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a few quick questions for me. In terms of the 7,500-foot lateral, could you give us an idea of the well cost there? And then, over time, how you guys think about the well cost in the Wolfcamp in terms of the potential to move those costs down as you get more towards the development program?","John A. Lambuth","This is John. I don't have the actual well cost right in front of me. But by memory, we were right around in the 8.5 range for that well. We were very pleased with that well as far as the drilling of it. We can get back to you for sure with the actual cost, just to make sure I'm close on that. But it drilled very well, it completed well, we were very pleased with the results of that well. And now, again, with that Chevron agreement in place, we now have the freedom, so to speak, to now go and push it to 10,000-foot, which is essentially the beauty of that agreement, enabling us to combine those adjacent sections in that way. So that's what we're moving forward to. Again, we're very, very pleased with results of that well. And we think going to 10,000, we think we can get even better type results. Because once we get in that lateral, the drilling goes very fast. So it doesn't add that much more in the way of days to go another 2,500 feet. So we're pretty excited about the potential for that well.","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe. I'll just make a quick comment on that. The majority of the cost increase we anticipate to see, as John mentioned, we're making tremendous time in the laterals using rotary steerable tools. And so what it really comes down to, it's a completion. And there are stages that are associated with the the longer lateral like that.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And as we compare the Delaware Basin drilling program to maybe what we're seeing from offset operators in the Midland Basin, do you think ultimately that the longer laterals in higher stage completions will be utilized on the wells you're drilling today. And in terms of the wells we've seen to date, I just wanted to make sure I clarified that, those wells have been drilled on 5,000 foot laterals with 12 stages, is that correct?","John A. Lambuth","Yes, this is John. That is correct. As Tom alluded to, up until now, we've kind of stuck with the same type of completion program. In some ways, that makes sense because we're trying to derisk that area. But quite frankly now, we're at a point now where we're looking to maximize returns with every well we drill. So the things that we will be testing in the near future are as just Tom alluded to, on a 5,000-foot lateral, we'll certainly go to more stages, 20 stages, if not slightly more. Likewise, when we then scale up to a longer lateral, a 10,000-foot lateral, then there's a good chance again that we'll be scaling up in the stages in that as well. The 7,500-foot lateral would have essentially had the same equivalent stage with -- as with a 5,000. So we really didn't change that design as much as all we did is added additional stages for that length. So there's definitely some additional upside here with the improvement in our frac design in this program.","Thomas E. Jorden","Again, we hope to be able to discuss particular results in future calls. We're flowing our 10,000-foot lateral in Reeves County back now. We'll have 10,000-foot lateral in Culberson County. But based on our existing 7,500-foot lateral, as John said, we think we see this as having the potential, which is our current completion design, to be north of 15% after-tax rate of return. And so we see a lot of upside on that number. So yes, we're very optimistic. We're forging ahead as fast as we can. But this sure looks does like it's working and working well.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And just my last question on the back of that. In terms of your capital program as we look out over the next few years, from a philosophical perspective, if you start to generate these high rates of return with potentially very repeatable asset base here, how do you think about capital outspend over the next few years in terms of accelerating the Permian? Has your view changed at all in terms of the way that you're willing to flex your balance sheet?","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, this is Tom. I'll take it from the back -- you asked question first. Our view hasn't changed at all. We are very willing to invest capital if we can do it with a good rate of return and making sure that with reasonable commodity downside protection, we don't destroy capital. And so we run our commodity downside, as well as $60 oil, and we look at flat $3 gas, flat forever on both commodities, less local D there [ph]. If we can get a good return on capital, we're very confident that, that's indeed the case, we will accelerate. And so we're looking at just that case in the Permian now. And with the opportunities that we have in front of us, with the balance sheet we have available to us, I would say accelerating this program in future years is not off the table for us, it's under act of consideration.","Operator","Our next question will come from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping you can talk about the potential for other Wolfcamp zones in your Reeves and Ward County acreage, below, I guess, what the Wolfcamp Bay you've tested so far?","John A. Lambuth","Yes, this is John. As we mentioned, our first 2 wells were A tests. And even the long lateral we drilled has been an A test. That said, we are aware of a couple of competitor wells that had been located in the deeper C, D interval. And indeed, we have -- I'm aware of at least one test coming up, but we'll be testing that interval on our acreage. So yes, we recognize it as an opportunity, and we will be testing it with the well here coming up soon.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And on the Ward County acreage, do you have any concerns that there may be depletion in the Wolfcamp over there due to your fairly extensive 3rd Bone Spring drilling?","John A. Lambuth","This is John. I'll start with that question. I'll just simply say, as we look at it, the Wolfcamp is a pretty thick interval. And we see that there is quite a bit of vertical separation that we can achieve, where we can put a lateral and separate ourself from that third 3rd Bone lateral that we feel comfortable, at least going forward, in testing that. I'll put it that way. But there is an uncertainty there, I won't deny that.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So do you see Wolfcamp B, C, D on that Ward County acreage as well?","John A. Lambuth","Yes -- I can't -- I just -- I'll just say that we see Wolfcamp intervals. I'm not as familiar with that right now. I mean, we see its perspective. I'll put it that.","Thomas E. Jorden","This is Tom. I just want to caution -- this is a blocking- and tackling-type project. It's very difficult to wave your arms at this type of expanse and make simple rules. The Wolfcamp B that works very well in Culberson County, there are places in Reeves County, where it'll produce too much water to be economically perspective. So we're -- what we've talked about today, with the acreage potential, the well potential, we are absolutely confident on that. Now could it be better? You bet. But we're just not going to look at that section and say, \"Hey, let's do acreage math and run with it.\" It's too complex. That's the way --- we look at it as very detailed. And we'd certainly encourage everybody to understand. It's very dangerous to wave your arms around this type of real estate.","Operator","The next question will come from Jason Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just following up on Reeves. Can you just remind us what your drilling requirements are to hold acreage there, maybe over the next 12 months? And then also, as you and other producers in the area start to ramp up production, can you give us an update as to where infrastructure stands today as well?","John A. Lambuth","This is John. I'll take the first part of the question. In regards to Reeves and holding our acreage, we have about -- well, we need to spend about $170 million drilling program next year. And with that program, we'll be in good shape to hold all of our acreage in that area. And that's, obviously, very doable for us. As far as the marketing, I'll hand it to Joe.","Joseph R. Albi","Yes, this is Joe. We have, right now, currently an infrastructure in place that we feel can accommodate the short-term going schedule. And we are currently, also, working with purchasers and processors in the area to attain more firm capacity to deliver gas for processing. As far as salt water disposal goes, we're aggressively looking at the drill schedule, and what we need to do to get ahead of that from a SWD perspective.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. And I know you guys took the acreage up in the last few months from 35,000 to 40,000. Are you still seeing opportunities to add there?","John A. Lambuth","This is John. Yes, the answer is yes. We are still actively pursuing additional acreage. Obviously, with all these competitors and their release, it gets -- it's getting a little bit tougher, but absolutely. We are still aggressively trying to pursue more acreage.","Operator","The next question will come from Gil Yang of DISCERN.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","To follow on Jason's question there. How much is acreage costing that you're adding in that area?","Thomas E. Jorden","Gil, this is Tom. We're just not prepared to talk about what we're paying for acreage. I would say to our competitors, it's way too expensive, and you probably don't want to afford it.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Fair enough. And could you characterize it? Is it filling in chunks of holes within the acreage blocks you have? Or is it also trying to expand the overall footprint?","Thomas E. Jorden","Again, Gil, we're in a competitive situation. And I'm just going to pass on that. We have an active acreage acquisition program this year, and we're building. So if you'll just indulge me to be that vague.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Fair enough, Tom. I may have missed it, but how much are your -- those Reeves County well costing?","Joseph R. Albi","Well, they should be a little bit more expensive. They're a little bit -- this is Joe. they're a little bit deeper, so I'd probably tack on another $500,000 to $750,000 to our regular Wolfcamp.","John A. Lambuth","This is John. I guess, I have more recent information, because we're just looking at decisions the other day on this wells. And that particular AFE was around $7.3 million. It is what I recall for our latest Reeves County-Wolfcamp well.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","That was a -- was that a 10,000 foot lateral or?","John A. Lambuth","No, no that was not. And, in fact, I should just go and stand corrected now. On our 7,500-foot lateral in Culberson, our actual costs were, actually, more in the $10 million range, not $8.5 million. And I want to stand corrected on that. So around $10 million, $10.5 million is what we spent there.","Thomas E. Jorden","But those return on capital numbers were fully [indiscernible].","John A. Lambuth","No, no those -- no, absolutely. The return on capital is definitely against that actual well cost. I want to be clear about that.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Okay. All right, so $7.3 million for the Reeves 5,000-foot lateral and $10 million for the 7,500-foot Culberson lateral?","John A. Lambuth","Yes.","Thomas E. Jorden","That's our actual. That's not -- we're getting better. So that -- we're just quoting our actual and we're -- our landscape of improving results.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","And then just last question. You mentioned early on that the completion cost, I think, are coming down. Is that because of additions to pumping capacity in the area? Or is it -- that other operators are beginning to slow their activity down or changing the mix of what they're doing?","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe. I'll answer that. It's really due to, I think, what I'd call a competition moving over from the Midland Basin into the Delaware Basin. The majority of our cost decrease have come on both the service side and the material side. And, really, a result of just having more competition and available horsepower in the Delaware.","Thomas E. Jorden","But you know, Gil, I want -- I think about completion cost a little differently. I think about drilling cost. There's no argument on why you wouldn't want your drilling cost to be as cheap as it can be, given that you're having a good clean, safe operation. Completions are a little different, because as we optimize, we've talked about going from 12 to 20 stages on a type -- 5,000-foot lateral. We may elect to spend more in our completions if we think that those are generating superior returns. So I wouldn't necessarily look to see our completion cost uniformly come down. That's a decision we'll make based on optimizing the performance.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Ray Deacon of Brean Capital.","Raymond J. Deacon - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about expectations for the oil NGL split for the remainder of the year? It seems like you're a good bit higher than your guidance that you gave out at the beginning of the year and just wondering what the second half would look like?","Mark Burford","Do you want to do that?","Thomas E. Jorden","The other one [ph]...","Mark Burford","Yes, Ray. So yes, our first -- our oil component has been going up. That's right. The growth is being faster in oil. But our split is about 50 -- our split last year was up 31% oil, 8% NGL, 53% gas. And we should be up slightly. This quarter, we are closer to what -- we are at 30% -- excuse me, actually, I'm finding my split in front of me here. But our percent of oil should go up by 1% or 2% through the range of the year, and with the -- 50% gas, 32% oil, 18% NGLs. The percent of oil might tick up 1-or-so percent rate for the second half of the year for the full year.","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe. The only thing I'd add to that is, in our modeling, we've assumed ethane rejection for Q3, but don't know anything about Q4 enough to feel comfortable making an estimate there. So to the effect ethane rejection occurs in Q4, that could skew some of those numbers.","Operator","The next question will come from Cameron Horwitz of U.S. Capital Advisors.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","I guess a question for John. John, can you just -- can you do a little comparison on Wolfcamp A, seeing Culberson versus what you saw on Reeves. I mean, it seems like operators are seeing better productivity and potentially some higher oil yields moving up in the zone, in the Wolfcamp in Reeves County. And was there -- do you think that'll be analogous to what happens in Culbertson?","John A. Lambuth","Well, this is John. I sure hope so. As Tom stated, we're drilling that well right now. And yes, I mean, if I would to state what our expectations is, I think that's what we'd hope to see. All I can say is, just as we look at it from our logs and from the subsurface, we like to look at the A in Culberson. But I don't have a well producing there to tell you whether it's good or not. That's why we're doing it. And so, hopefully, we'll have results here by -- at some point that we can talk about, and be very proud of. But that's where we are right now. We're drilling the well, and that's what we're hoping that the results will be.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate it. And Reeves County, and I know it's still early there, but I think one of those wells, you'll probably have a little bit more extended production history on. Can you just talk a little bit about how you think that curve is going to shakeout? I mean, is it similar to what you see in Culberson?","John A. Lambuth","I would say, like for any of the shale wells, so far, they have a decline profile that, that's not unexpected. I mean, that they are declining about how we'd expect them to. Again, a lot of these shale wells are really somewhat dependent upon those early 30-day IP rates. That's really a telltale sign of how good a well you have. And as you can tell, we have some pretty good 30-day rates, so we're very pleased with those wells so far. And so far, based on the production, we like it enough that we're going to commit to the amount of capital I talked about next year, the $170 million, to hold it. It's looking good so far.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, and I just want to underscore, we only talk about 30-day rates. I know a lot of people are out there talking about peak rates, 24-hour IP, our experience is the only rate that's really meaningful in evaluating the quality of well is that 30-day average. And we've got very, very solid, very good 30-day averages.","John A. Lambuth","I would concur. Yes.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Burford for any closing remarks.","Mark Burford","Thank you very much for joining us today.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone, and again, welcome to the Cimarex First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. An updated presentation was posted to our website this morning. We will be referring to this presentation during our call today. As a reminder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements.","A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business. We expect to file an amended 10-K for 2016 and our Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31 later today.","Our prepared remarks will begin with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling activities and results from John Lambuth, SVP of Exploration; and then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on our operations including production and well costs; and our CFO, Mark Burford, is also present to help answer any questions.","So that we can accommodate more of your questions during the hour we have allotted for the call, we'd like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Feel free to get back in the queue if you like.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you, Karen, and thanks to all of you who are joining us for the call. Cimarex had a very good first quarter. Our production beat was driven by continued improvement in our well results, operational excellence and field execution and a bit of luck, as we had not experienced any significant weather or field outage events during the quarter. Hats off to our organization for outstanding execution during the quarter. As a result, we're raising our full-year production guidance to 1.09 Bcf equivalent per day to 1.13 Bcf equivalent per day. Our full-year exploration and development capital remains unchanged at $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.","We're pleased to be sharing a trove of operational updates with you during the call this morning. John will be updating you on a number of important projects as he will describe these projects of tested well spacing, the stacking and staggering of wells, landing zone selection and completion optimization. Our results in these projects have been highly encouraging. Quarterly results are interesting, but we focus on the long term.","Our core belief is that shareholders are best served by reinvesting their cash flow at the highest rates of return we can manage. Our industry tends to be trendy as certain plays and basins fall in and out of favor. Our focus remains on full cycle, fully burdened return on capital employed. We strive to build a portfolio that can deliver superior returns through the cycles. We have never felt more confident in our assets, our ongoing results and our ability to execute on our mission. We are achieving excellent return on capital and are extending our inventory life through tighter well spacing, opening up additional zones and through exploration leasing. The rate of change within Cimarex is accelerating, driven by increasingly positive results. As the song goes, the future's so bright, I gotta wear shades.","We have spoken at length regarding our commitment to science, innovation and an understanding of the downhole physics behind landing zone selection and completion innovations. These understandings have tremendous implications to well bore spacing, well performance and net asset optimization. We also speak directly to return on capital, asset life and depth of inventory. Being good at the science tends to extend inventory life.","The results you will hear in this call are no accident. They are the direct result of an organization that is focused on innovation, honestly examines its failures as well as its successes and strives to be an open, transparent culture where technical debate is highly encouraged. We relentless study our competition and try to learn from their successes and failures.","As we look across the fence, we occasionally see infill projects that have significant well-to-well interference, resulting in meaningful degradation from parent well response. We understand these challenges and at times have faced these disappointments ourselves. Success or failure on these fronts will be a strong differentiator among E&P companies. We are pleased to report the results you will hear in this call. They are the result of tremendous persistence on the part of our geoscience and operations teams. As I said, it is no accident.","Finally, before I turn the call over to John, allow me to comment on the recent release of our accounting error. We recently discovered an error in the calculation of our ceiling test impairment. It was a simple error, but one that should never have been made. We immediately reported the error to our auditors, set about correcting our financials and put additional controls in place to make sure that this never happens again. Nothing is more important to us than our credibility. We will do better.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John for some highlights from our program.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity before getting into some of the specifics of our latest well results. During the first quarter, Cimarex invested $306 million on exploration and development activities. About 69% of our first quarter capital was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. We invested $197 million of the $306 million on the drilling and completion of new wells. Company-wide, we brought 70 gross, 26 net wells on production during the first quarter 2017.","As Tom mentioned, our 2017 exploration and development budget is unchanged at $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, with $850 million to $900 million still earmarked for drilling and completing wells. For the full year, we plan to invest 62% of our capital in the Permian region, with the remaining earmarked for Mid-Continent.","We entered 2017 with 11 operated rigs with 6 located in Mid-Continent and 5 in the Permian. During the month of April, we brought on three additional rigs in the Permian, which increased our total operated rig count to 14.","Now, on to well results. I want to start with the Permian region where we have some exciting results to share with you regarding a delineation test in the Upper Wolfcamp interval located on our White City, New Mexico acreage position. The Pintail 23-36H (sic) [Pintail 23-26H] well, whose location can be seen on slide 12 in our investor presentation, achieved a 30-day peak IP of 1,557 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 64% was oil. This well result, along with some recent competitor well results in the area, is helping us gain confidence that we have a highly economic target in the Upper Wolfcamp interval, along with the de-risked Lower Wolfcamp zone on our entire Eddy County, White City, New Mexico acreage position.","Staying in the Culberson County area, the Lower Wolfcamp, Tim Tam pilot, has been on production long enough in order for us to share with you their results. As shown on the cumulative production versus days plot on slide 16 of the presentation, these infill wells are performing as well as nearby parent wells with similar landing zones. The five 10,000-foot infill laterals achieved an average 30-day peak rate of 13.9 million cubic feet equivalent per day, with oil percentages varying from 26% to 36% depending upon landing zone.","This result confirms that we can very economically develop the Lower Wolfcamp interval at a minimum of six wells per section. In fact, due to the exceptional performance of these wells, we are formulating plans to test even tighter spacing in the Lower Wolfcamp later this year.","In Reeves County, we have encouraging results to share with you regarding our Wood State, Upper Wolfcamp infill project which is testing the equivalent of 12 wells per section. Excluding the Wood State 47-26 2H (09:05) which is shut in awaiting remediation work, these five infill wells achieved a 30-day peak average rate of 1,973 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 46% was oil.","More importantly, as shown on slide 19 of our presentation, three of the five wells after 175 days of production have averaged 309,000 barrels of oil equivalent of cumulative production, which is slightly less than the best parent well drilled to date by Cimarex in the area. As a follow-up to this project, we are currently flowing back the Pagoda State wells. This four-well pilot will be testing the equivalent of 16 wells per section in the Upper Wolfcamp.","And then in Northern Lea County, as shown on slide 11, we have adjusted our Wolfcamp fairway polygon to include additional prospective acreage based on our updated subsurface maps in this area along with incorporating recent competitor well results. This adjustment had resulted in our prospective Lea County Wolfcamp acreage increasing from 5,600 to 32,000 net acres. We are now working on plans to drill our first Wolfcamp lateral in this North Lea County area later this year.","Now, on to Mid-Continent. The Leon Gundy project is our stacked\/staggered Meramec-Woodford spacing pilot testing 10 wells per section in two benches within the Meramec, along with the proven spacing of nine wells per section in the Woodford. These wells were brought on production in October and we now have enough data in order to discuss the results. The four 5,000 foot lateral Gundy Meramec wells achieved a 30-day peak average rate of 8.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, of which 60% was gas, 20% NGL and 20% oil. As shown on slide 23 of our presentation, the cumulative production of the four Gundy Meramec wells after 200 days is greater than the average cumulative production for nearby Meramec parent wells. This is a very nice outcome.","Finally, completion operations have begun on our Woodford eight-well increased density pilot that is testing both 16 and 20 Woodford wells per section, as diagramed on slide 25. First production from this infill pilot is expected in early September.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you, John, and thank you all again for joining our call today. I'll recap on the usual items, our first quarter production, our updated 2017 production outlook, and then I'll finish up with a few comments on LOE and service costs.","While we're off to a great start in 2017, our Q1 2017 net equivalent production came in at 1.063 Bcf a day, beating the upper end of our guidance by 13 million a day and setting a new record for total company production. With quarter-to-quarter production gains in both the Permian and Mid-Continent, our Q1 total company net equivalent volume was up 11% from our Q4 2016 posting of 960 million a day and 9% from our Q1 2016 volume of 973 million a day.","With our focus on Permian oil and high-liquid Mid-Continent projects, we saw a solid sequential quarter increase in oil production, reporting a total company Q1 oil volume of 52,181 barrels of oil per day, up 15% from Q4 2016 and 13% from Q1 2016. Our oil volumes were up in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent, with our Q1 Permian oil production up 13% and our Q1 Mid-Continent oil production up 20% from Q4 2016. With a strong contribution from our Reeves County Wood State project that John mentioned, our Q1 2017 Permian net equivalent volume came in at 577 million a day, that's up 13% from Q4 2016 and 21% from Q1 2016. We brought on a total of 25 gross, 16 net Permian wells during the quarter and we had 14 gross and 11 net wells waiting on completion at quarter end.","We also saw a nice gain in our Q1 Mid-Continent volumes with continued operated and non-operated production adds from our East Cana infill project. Our Q1 Mid-Continent net equivalent production came in at 484 million a day. That's up 9% from Q4 2016. In aggregate, we brought on 45 gross and 10 net wells in the Mid-Continent during the quarter and we have 68 gross and 15 net wells still waiting on completion at quarter's end.","Looking forward into 2017, we've updated our model to incorporate our actual Q1 results and the projected drilling and completion schedules for the three Permian rigs we added in mid to late April. With our Q1 production beat and our revised projections, we've increased our full year guidance to 1.09 Bcf to 1.13 Bcf a day. That's up from the 1.06 Bcf to 1.11 Bcf a day we reported last call and it reflects a 13% to 17% increase over the 963 million a day that we reported in 2016.","The 2017 capital remains focused on high-liquid Permian and Mid-Continent projects. As a result, we continue to project significant oil growth in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent during the year, which results in total company forecasted year-over-year production growth in the range of 24% to 28%. Our projected capital and completion activity remains skewed, approximately 60% to the Permian and 40% to the Mid-Continent. We anticipate bringing on 60 net Permian wells and 39 net Mid-Continent wells during 2017, and that's up from the 30 and 31 respective net wells that we completed in the two areas during 2016.","With our strong tailwind from Q1, we're modeling Q2 production to be in the range of 1.08 Bcf to 1.13 Bcf a day. That's up 2% to 6% over Q1, and it's an 11% to 16% increase over Q2 2016. We're forecasting a number of our Permian and Mid-Continent spacing projects to come on online later in the year, and that will accelerate our capital and completion activity forecast into the Q3 to Q4 timeframe. As such, we're modeling Q3 to be relatively flat to Q2 followed by a nice production ramp in Q4.","Our production calls for Q4 2017 exit rate in the neighborhood of 1.13 Bcfe to 1.19 Bcfe a day, and that's a strong 18% to 24% increase over Q4 2016. On top of that, we'll have approximately 44 net wells either drilling or waiting on completion as we forecasted at the end of the year. So with that, we anticipate having great momentum going into 2018.","Jumping over to OpEx, our first quarter lifting cost came in at $0.65 per Mcfe. That's right at the midpoint of our guidance of $0.60 to $0.70 and just below our 2016 average of $0.66 per Mcfe. Our Q1 posting was approximately $0.07 above the $0.58 mark that we reported in Q4, and that's primarily a result of increased workover activity in Q1 as compared to not only Q4 2016, but several recent past quarters.","We are starting to feel some LOE cost pressures in items such as compression and water hauling. That said, our production team remains vigilant to maintain the reduced operating cost structure that they've worked so hard to achieve.","Taking into account the fluctuating nature of our workover expenses and our 2017 focused on high-liquid projects, we're maintaining our 2017 lifting cost guidance of $0.60 to $0.70 for the year. That's well below the $0.83 per Mcfe we posted in 2015 and the $1.08 we reported in 2014.","And finally some comments on drilling and completion costs. On the drilling side, although a number of cost components have remained in check, we've seen 5% to 10% increases in items such as day rates and directional services. And with less availability on the ground, we've seen 15% to 25% increases in the cost of our tubulars. With our dry hole cost or drilling cost representing only about 30% to 35% of our AFEs, at the total well cost level, the largest cost pressure we're seeing is on the completion side.","In addition to seeing increased cost \u2013 service cost to pump our fracs, we're also experiencing a tighter market for prop, which also appears to have limited supply on the ground. We've been able to offset a good portion of the service cost increases by optimizing our job design, utilizing fewer stages and pumping zipper fracs where we can, and we've focused on long lead time planning to ensure adequate prop sourcing for our program.","As compared to Q4 2016, we've seen our current total company per well average frac cost increase approximately $300,000 to $500,000 per well, which again is dependent on so many variables such as lateral length, number of stages, pounds pumped and so on. Although we focused our drilling and completion efficiencies to limit the impact of these frac cost increases, we've experienced some modest increases in our total well costs.","In the Permian, we've raised our current Bone Spring 1-mile lateral AFE with larger fracs, approximately $300,000 to $500,000 per well, with a range of $5 million to $6 million. In the Wolfcamp, we've increased our AFEs for larger completion, 2-mile lateral Wolfcamp wells in Culberson by $300,000 to $10.5 million to $11.7 million per well. That's still down from the late 2015 cost levels we had and with a much larger completion today. In Cana, our current Woodford 1-mile lateral AFEs are running in a range of $7.5 million to $8 million, that's up $400,000 to $500,000, again, all driven by higher frac cost.","And as we continue to experiment with frac design, we bumped the midpoint of the cost range for current 2-mile Meramec AFEs by about $250,000 with a range of $10.5 million to $12.5 million per well with frac design again being the largest cost variable.","So in closing, we're off to a great start here in 2017. Our diversified oil-focused development program generated a great production beat in Q1. With that as our springboard, we're forecasting continued production growth coming here into Q2 with forecasted year-over-year total company production growth of 13% to 17% and just as important a strong exit rate to enter 2018.","We stay focused on finding cost pressures in order to keep our cost structure healthy and strong and our overall program continues to generate positive results, all that despite the modest cost increases we've seen in our total well costs. All in, we remain very excited about 2017.","So with that, I'll open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from Jeanine Wai with Citigroup.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Good morning, Jeanine.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Good morning.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just back to the oil production for the quarter. You provided guidance during the last earnings call of 30% to 35% growth 4Q to 4Q and just given the strong oil production during 1Q, is there upside to that prior commentary or is the strong 1Q oil number mainly a function of timings? And we also noticed as you mentioned that you did more wells in 1Q than expected, but that Q2, number of completions went down.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is Joe. The way I would answer that question, we \u2013 in total, as you look at the year, the net well completions quarter-to-quarter, we had a good number of completions in Q1. We'll see that slow down a little bit in Q2 and ramp back up into Q3 and then taper off just a smidge in Q4 as wells come online, and with that parallels our projected oil production and our oil growth. We're still projecting that our oil growth will continue to extend itself into the fourth quarter and surpass slightly the ranges that we quoted last call.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then my related or unrelated follow-up, in terms of the rig count for the year. You guys have 14 right now and we noticed in the updated presentation that the commentary of 18 rigs by 4Q dropped off to 5? So, just wondering if the 18 rigs are still the plan for this year or was that just \u2013 we're reading too much into that?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is John. It's still quite frankly little bit of flux as to when those additional rigs will come on. It's a matter of timing between us and our partner in the Mid-Continent region with our next major development project. We're still working with them, trying to decide the overall scope and size of the project. And based on what we finally settle on would dictate whether the rigs show up late this year or early next year. So we're still working on that right now.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Jeanine, I'll just add to that, those additional four rigs, as John mentioned, are for our development project on the Western side of our stacked asset. Those wells, whether we added them \u2013 those rigs whether we add them this year or next year, we're going to be flowing in the \u2013 John, correct me, it's East side. Yeah. East side.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","East side, the more liquid-rich of the Woodford.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","But the rigs were going to be deployed for drilling and the completion would flow into 2018. So it's really not a big impact on \u2013 it's zero impact on this year other than whatever drilling capital it would've had. But as John mentioned, we're still working through the timing there.","Operator","Thank you. And...","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","And this is Joe. I'll add that we have, as forecasted, approximately 44 wells that we'd still be drilling and waiting on completion with the \u2013 just the Permian rig counts that we've got in our current plan at the end of the year.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Couple questions. Lea County, it seems like there's been a lot of activity there lately or a lot, I guess, results coming out between yourselves, EOG had some nice wells. I know Devon's doing some down-spacing in there. Can you just talk about, is this something different or I know you've been up there and you're testing tighter spacing, but can you just talk a little, I guess, more general about the area and what you're seeing?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. David, let me start, and then John will follow up. We've always loved Lea County. One of the reasons that we haven't aggressively developed our acreage at the multiple levels is because it's really quite good and we wanted to make sure that we got our spacing and our science right because you can always back up and get a do over. There have been some offset well results. We've extended our mapping, and the play has just extended. And we're quite bullish on the outset, not only for the Wolfcamp, but a number of different zones.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. I would just say that you'll see more of our activity moving into Lea County later this year. We have quite a bit of drilling we want to do up there. It's not \u2013 like Tom said, we've always loved Lea County. It's just over the last few years, with the pull back in our capital, most of our drilling has been to hold acreage that we needed to hold down in Culberson and Reeves. We are very fortunate that almost all of our position in Lea is a well-held HBP acreage, be it a previous drilling we've done mostly in the Bone Spring and other targets. So we're just now starting to focus more energy to get in there and then taking advantage, as Tom said, of the fact that a lot of our competitors are \"delineating\" our acreage for us. So it looks very, very attractive and thus resulting in the updating we gave on the increase in the acreage there.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, and just to clarify. So, compared to three to six months \u2013 or whatever, six to nine months ago, this is \u2013 or compared to the original 2017 guidance is maybe the better way of looking at our development schedule, this has moved up and you're probably moving that in and moving something else out. Is that fair?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","To be honest, no, we already had plans to be in Lea County. I think right now, incrementally may be a well or two, but certainly, it will have a bigger impact as we look into 2018. And, again, we have the luxury of having that HBP position. So, we want to make sure \u2013 if we go up there because that acreage is very precious to us, we want to make sure we develop it right. So we have a very good plan. We have a couple spacing pilots that's always been planned for later this year, one in the Wolfcamp, one in the Avalon. And from that, we'll formulate more plans to get probably a little bit more activity when we get into 2018.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, and thanks for the completion schedule in the slide deck, but what's your appetite, I guess, to \u2013 I guess this is to Tom, what's your appetite to increase CapEx? Obviously, you have the balance sheet for it. You have the dollar sitting there if you need it. How are you thinking about acceleration \u2013 or potential for acceleration beyond the current plan?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, we \u2013 our plan is our plan, so you're asking me to speculate, and that's something I'll do that. We really are quite positive on our assets. John and I spent all day yesterday with the Culberson County team looking at that asset, and it's just tremendous. Not only are we seeing fantastic well-level results, we're seeing real good improvements in our science around infill drilling and spacing.","And then, when you look at that asset where we have a huge arena of 10,000-foot long horizontal wells that we can drill without regard to the lease line, it's pretty easy to get pretty excited about it. And that's just one part of our program. And so as we look ahead, we do have the wherewithal to accelerate. We have the balance sheet to accelerate. We have the projects to accelerate. And although we don't publish inventory numbers, you can read between the lines, the way we look at it internally, our inventory has increased significant because of the work that our organization has done. So, yeah, we'd like to bring that net asset value forward and we have the wherewithal to accelerate.","Now that said, there are some macro events that are going to overprint that. We want to make sure that we're drilling into an acceptable cost and commodity structure and we're going to manage that balance sheet pretty carefully. But I think definitely as you look at us, there is a chance that we have some bias to the upside here.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. No. I appreciate the color. I appreciate the speculation. Thank you.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Irene Haas of Wunderlich.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Yes. To carry on David's question. Zooming back to Lea County, you mentioned that you pretty much remapped your play outline, that you're going to be drilling your first well in Lea County. Can I ask when and what target horizon?","Then my second question is your recompletion. You're using bigger fracs and got quite a stunning uplift. I was wondering where the location of that well \u2013 is it 23 South, 33 East? And also, a little more color as to what you exactly did there. I'm very curious.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Okay. Well, I will answer certainly your first question in regards to Northern Lea County. Yes. We have undertaken better mapping of the Wolfcamp up in that northern part of our acreage. We're starting to appreciate, it doesn't take as much net thickness within the Wolfcamp to still have a very good outcome and that is leading to us getting much more bullish on our acreage up there. And, of course, that, coupled with some competitor results nearby, never hurts either.","We've actually already drilled a Wolfcamp well in Lea County. I guess we need to make sure we get our map updated, and that well has been known for quite a while now, and it's a very good well. And we have plans now to go up to that Northern Lea County area that we've expended our polygon on, and there, we'll be testing again the Wolfcamp up there. Based on competitor results, we have high expectations for that well. And with that in hand, hopefully later this year, we'll get even more bullish in terms of future drilling we want to do there next year. Regarding the recompletion though...","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. We're not sure which well you're talking about, Irene, Were you referring to the Pintail well that John mentioned in Eddy County?","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","No. Triste Draw 25 7H. I think you guys went in and saw quite a bit of uplift. That is also in Lea County.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, we did. But the latest Triste Draw I'm aware of is an Avalon new drill well.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Oh, the new drill. Okay.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Which is a very good well, but we don't have enough production to speak to that well just yet, if that's the one you're referring to.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. Irene, as you know, we like to have at least 30 days of established production, on some of these longer laterals we like to have even more than that. So, we'll typically want to make sure that we have something definitive about a well before we talk about its results.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Okay. Fine. Then with the Northern Wolfcamp well, is it in the Wolfcamp D or B or A?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","It would be what we would just call the Upper Wolfcamp. Others would call A. That would be the primary target for that acreage up there. And that's what we'd be going after.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Hm'hmm.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Mike Scialla with Stifel.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Good morning, everybody. I'm wondering, the land and seismic CapEx for the first quarter is a little bit higher than we were anticipating. Just wondering, did you actually add any acreage or was that just a lease retention cost or anything else you can talk about there?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Sure. This is John. That was acreage additioning (33:28), we leased \u2013 we had an opportunity on a new concept and we liked the concept. So, we went out and aggressively acquired acreage on it. So, that was, yes, that was a little bit above and beyond what we planned for the quarter. It's kind of more of a one-off event. We don't expect to spend that same amount on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but we saw a very good opportunity for an idea that our team had put together. And so we went out and captured it. Again, I'll emphasize we don't expect that same type of expenditure for the remaining quarters this year, unless, of course, they come up with a really good idea.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","And then, we'll go do it again. But that is what was going on in that first quarter.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Just by way of overall program, we want to always be making land investments. But what we do is we look very carefully full cycle at the return on our investment, fully burdened with land, corporate overhead, all associated costs, and then we look at our total program and make sure that land is not too high a part of the overall expenditure. And we've always managed the company that way. We look at it on an ongoing basis.","You have to make the land investments. Otherwise, you're essentially liquidating the company. You may be liquidating on a 50-year time horizon, but we always want to be bringing in new things to replace what we drill. And so from time to time, you're going to see that land investment swing up and down. It's a part of our ongoing business.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Can you say where that new opportunity is, or is it going to remain kind of in the stealth mode for a while?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Stealth mode.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. At this point \u2013 I'm going to ask one more on the prices. It looks like you had pretty good realizations for your products in the Permian for the first quarter. There have been some concern about where those prices may head. I just wanted your thoughts on that potential for adding firm transportation or further hedging?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is Joe. On the gas side, yeah, I think, overall, that differential increase is kind of stemming around concerns about Mexico infrastructure and demand and maybe secondly the pipe outlets to the Gulf Coast. And we're having no problem selling our gas right now. We are seeing the hit of the differential. Long term looking out, we're looking at the various options for pipe out of Waha to the Gulf Coast because we think it will be something that we're going to need to secure ourselves with.","We do have Perm on El Paso coming off the tailgate of our Hidalgo plant and we're looking at possible other open seasons as well. So, we're taking a proactive stance to try to secure the Perm that we think makes sense relative to our volumes and then think long term on how to better get our gas out of the basin.","With regard to the oil side, we believe that there's capacity that does exist right now. Current supply or surplus capacity on takeaway out of the basin we think is sufficient for the short term. Long term, we're going to look \u2013 again, like I mentioned on the gas side, at possible solutions as well. As far as Delaware, gravities being a little bit higher than Midland. We do see a variation in our gravities from Reeves over to Culberson and our contracts to sell both those will allow for us to blend and we're well below the minimums on those contracts. So, we've had no problems right now getting oil or gas out of the basin. So hopefully that answers your questions.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Hey, Mike, I'll just add on that. On the first quarter, we did see a positive Midland \u2013 Cushing differential, which definitely benefited our realization in the first quarter. It's something in the neighborhood of $0.60 positive. Looking forward in the second quarter on the futures market, that's probably going to go up to maybe $0.80 to $1, currently at $0.70 at today's spot price. And looking out in the third or fourth quarter, this may be up to just over $1. And out into 2018 on a fourth trip (37:47) it's in the $1.20-ish range going out into the future. So yeah, we'll definitely have to keep monitoring that Mid-Cush differential and even consider our hedging practice around that. Currently, we only hedge it to WTI NYMEX, but we'll keep monitoring that differential.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very good. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Unknown Speaker","Hey. Good morning. This is actually Ray (38:13) on for Neal. Just looking at that successful Pintail well test, any further plans that you guys have in Eddy County and any color on how far north you guys \u2013 into Eddy County you guys are planning to go?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. This is John. Yes, we plan to drill quite a few more wells up in the White City area, both in the Upper Wolfcamp and the Lower Wolfcamp. And yes, we will be testing upwards to the Northern part of that contiguous acreage block. I think if we looked at slide 12, you can see where the Pintail is located, but you'll see we have more acreage located further to the north and we do have plans, as I said, to test both upper and lower, and that part of it.","I'll also just add, again, there's quite a few competitor wells that come on in and around that acreage block. And that has given us quite a bit of encouragement that a lot of that acreage is going to be very prospective for both towns. And so, hopefully, in the coming quarters, you'll hear us talk more about some results up there.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Within that acreage block, that ends up on our Culberson County map is up in Eddy County. It's higher working interest. We don't have a partnership around that acreage. And depending on where you draw the outline, this 35,000 net acres to 40,000 net acres, we've been up there for quite a while. In fact, our first Wolfcamp well in our program \u2013 first horizontal well was drilled up there in 2010 in the Lower Wolfcamp. We've done a fair amount of development up there in Bone Spring and are still doing so, and this well that John's spoken of, the Pintail well was our first Upper Wolfcamp test up there. It's highly encouraging and it opens up most, if not, all of that acreage to Upper Wolfcamp in addition to Lower Wolfcamp and that's also a fairly contiguous block that supports long laterals. So it's a real significant data point to us in terms of our future program.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And as you guys continue to test and delineate your Mid-Con, just want to get an \u2013 if there's an update on thoughts around timing for full-on development there.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, when you say full-on development, I'm assuming you're referring to incorporating the Meramec into our development plans because of course we have been developing the Woodford now here over the last several years, what I would call full development. What I would just say is that the spacing pilot result that I commented on, the Leon Gundy's is extremely encouraging to us in regards that the Gundy's or the Meramec wells responded very nicely to our design, such that it really points the way to quite a bit of our acreage could be receptive to that 19 wells per section development and that is something that we're looking at very intensely. We have some additional testing we're going to do of that concept in terms of stacking two layers into Meramec and one into Woodford. Well, we have a few small projects that we're doing later in the year to test that. But we're also developing plans to get to that type of 19-well-per-section development sometime next year in 2018 on some of our acreage. So we are getting there.","And then to continue on that, of course, us and Devon still are formulating plans for long lateral development there in that Eastern part. Right now, it's still focused on Woodford, but we still have some plans to go forward with that long-lateral development plan probably, like I said, late this year, early next year.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Matt Portillo with TPH.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Just a follow-up question to Lea County. Just wanted to ask you about the Bone Spring opportunity. I know it is an area where you've historically focused on legacy development. And I was curious how target lateral landing might change your views on delineating and further testing in the Bone Spring. We've seen some really strong industry results around Central Lea, and if that's in your plans this year.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","I'll take a stab at that and I'm sure Tom will want to follow up. For most of our Northern Lea County, we have already done a lot of legacy drilling in the Bone Spring. That's quite frankly where the whole play started. But we also recognize that that was technology from seven, eight years ago that when we look at our footprint there and look at those existing wells we have, we see wells that clearly did not have the most optimal stimulation.","We see potential white space, I'll call it, along the lateral of potential undrained reserves. And we obviously do not even feel like we see it like you mentioned that we may be tested all in our landing zones appropriately with those wells. So we have looked at going in and doing some additional infield drilling up on that acreage with modern stimulation and that's something we're still formulating and I'm sure we'll be doing some of that in the coming \u2013 rest of this year.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. The only thing I would add is \u2013 keying on what John said, that Bone Spring section really is multiple benches, multiple targets, many of which have not been tested. Our historical development is focused on sand benches in the second and third Bone Spring and it's a fairly target-rich section. So, we anticipate that being a part of our program for a long time. It's just we have lots to do and when you're going to get to it is the question.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. And just as a follow up to the exploration side of the story here. Just curious on your thoughts going into the back half of the year on incremental test in Ward and if there's any update to your drilling program around the Wolfcamp there?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is John. We have now drilled one 10,000-foot lateral in Ward. We're still monitoring that well closely and we have plans in the coming months to drill a second 10,000-foot lateral in Ward. Once we get those to kind of under our belt, we'll then be giving you an update on what we have found in terms of the new drilling with the new stimulations and what our expectations will be going forward for that acreage position.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Allman with FBR.","Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Hi, Joe.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, Tom. In your presentations, when we see the cumulative production curves that are straight lines with little or no bend, why is that happening and what do you take away from that and what message do you have for us in terms of modeling and estimating EURs and type curves and so on?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, that's a great observation and that's one of the things that is very exciting about our long lateral program. Not only are we seeing really nice top-line production rates out of these wells, but a much lower decline. Now, we have a lot of debate internally as to what the explanation of that is and then we'll probably have some debate here on the call amongst ourselves.","I think certainly, you could address that situation with plumbing, probably larger casing design would advance those production rates. But there's costs and operational issues associated with that. There's also the question of surface facility. So, it's a fairly complex matrix of cost than benefit. Yes, there's one school of thought that would say those slight declines are a negative because that means that a lot of hydrocarbons are waiting in line to get out of the wellbore, but there's no school of thought that says, you know what, those are great outcomes because it allows you to make more efficient use of your surface facilities. You keep them full for longer. And one thing I can tell you is the top-line returns out of those products are outstanding. And I'll give Joe or John the opportunity to comment on that.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. This is Joe. The only comment I'd make on that front is that in particular in Reeves County where we have higher liquids, we see it more prudent to run in the hole with tubing gas lift and any capillary treating mines at the time that we turn the well on. And this saves us from shutting in the well and doing it and as we get further down the road and that \u2013 down the road not being that far away before we feel like we'll see some detrimental flow due to lifting issues. But when you have the tubing in there, you're somewhat limited by which you can flow. And so that has a lot to do with what we're seeing in Reese County.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. And there's also \u2013 you never want to forget the water. It's one thing to look at the oil, but these wells make a lot of water as well. And so the surface facilities, disposal, all of that goes into your equation as to how you're going to design and flow these wells back.","Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","That's helpful. And just any additional comments you have on that just in terms of what it means for EURs and type curves and any message you have for us on that. And then I've got a follow-up question. Is there anywhere besides the Cana-Woodford where you've already decided on the optimal spacing and optimal completion and drilling technique and completion design such that you're ready to pretty much go full bore, full scale development?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, we haven't decided that in the Cana-Woodford. I mean, we've got some really good test results that as we've talked about in the past, 12 wells per section. We're currently completing or about to complete a project at 16 to 20 wells per section. So, this is a constant evolution here. As our understanding of the downhole system improves, that has direct implications to spacing. So, I hope it doesn't stop. We're going to have to just continue to learn as we go and have continuous improvement.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is John. I think the good news out of all that is \u2013 and I would echo what Tom said, is in some ways, we don't really know optimal for every single target we have. But because we have so many of them, it's not as though we're not able to deploy capital because we have a lot of different opportunities in the Meramec, the Woodford, both benches on the Wolfcamp as well as the Avalon to continue to test those spacing issues and still get good well results until we get capital in the ground, that we kind of have that luxury.","When will we get to that point? I don't know. Again, like Tom said, we just reviewed Culberson County yesterday. We were looking at the Tim Tam wells, very exciting wells for us. And immediately, we're all drawing what the next wine rack would look like for the Lower Wolfcamp and what would we do and how many wells could it be. And in the end, that is a wonderful thing in terms of the ultimate inventory and more importantly the ultimate PV value to this company with that acreage block. So, in some ways, I don't know. I don't know that we want to be in too much of a hurry. We want to make sure we get it right. But as I said, we're fortunate that we have enough of a portfolio that, trust me, we got enough places to go with the rigs to get this testing done, yet still get some very top-line results.","Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","That's all I have. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Morning.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I wanted to ask you about slide 20, the Triste Draw Avalon well that showed that huge increase on (50:35) test completions. I was wondering, is this being compared to older completions of the same lateral length?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. This is John. That would be comparable to, say, a year or two generation frac design behind with the same lateral length. That is correct.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","So, I'm not criticizing the Culberson results because they're great, too, but when we look at slide 13 and the Culberson uplifts, a similar cumulative uplift, there's a lateral length portion of it, and then there's the effect of the completions portion of it. It seems like here, the effect of the completions by itself is much more dramatic. I just wondered if you had any thoughts on that.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I mean, number one, I would say within the Avalon, we're very excited about the \u2013 simply by redesigning our completions, we got that kind of uplift for a well that's landed (51:31) the same, same lateral length as you pointed out. And so we in fact have gone back out and drilled another well in that area, that is currently still flowing back, where we've even pushed the envelope on the completion design and hopefully here in the next quarter or so, we'll talk about it.","In terms of what you see there on slide 13, yes, there's a component of lateral length which is important. But now, you're seeing us refining our completions. It's also fair to say that unlike in the Avalon and Culberson, we're in about generation number six in the frac design stage. So, we're not going to \u2013 I think you could say with each new revision, you're not going to see as much of an uplift as what you might have seen with that first change in Avalon. But still, we're making very good progress there in Culberson with our frac design in terms of improving the ultimate EUR for those wells.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","But I would say your observation is fair. I mean, we're \u2013 in our portfolio, we have a lot of different stratigraphies, lot of different lithologies, and they don't all respond similarly to frac optimization. You also have gas versus oil in the reservoirs, in some places, we're in a retrograde condensate, in other places, we're black oil in the reservoir. I would say, we share your observation that the Avalon play is probably the play where frac optimization has had this biggest just percent increase.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes, on the first generation change, absolutely, unequivocally, it has.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Yeah. Well, this is a high-class problem, that's for sure. But I just wanted to discuss that because it really kind of stood out. For my second question, I just wondered, could you add a little color on the Wood State well that is requiring remediation, just what went on there?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. This is Joe Albi. Late last quarter when we were cleaning out that well, we stuck bottom-hole assembly and coil tubing and made the decision after retrieving the majority of it that we would rather shut the well in, produce the offset well, slower any possible pressure in and around that well a bit and then come back in later to retrieve the fish. And so we currently have ongoing operations right now to retrieve that fish and are getting close to home.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. They're making good progress. That's just one of the maddening things, particularly when you go to pad drilling. And we talked about this on our last quarter call, where you have six or eight wells that are all close proximity. If you have an operational issue on one, it could delay the production on the entire set. But we're getting after it and I really want to credit our operations group for coming up with a creative, inventive solution that lets us get back on that well, produce the offsets and do so with a strong, strong emphasis on safety.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","And just to finish the thought, I mean, based on what you know now, do you expect that that well is going to be able to perform to its potential once you get the fishing done?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is John. I think our expectation is, and based on our experience in the past, is that yes, ultimately when we get that well back on, we will achieve the same EUR expectation. It's just it will not have the same kind of IP rate only because there's still \u2013 it's been sitting there with a lot of water both \u2013 the stimulation water both from its own well and other wells. So, it will take a while for that well to clean up. But in the end, no, we still have high expectations we'll get about the same EUR for it.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. This has nothing to do with the rocks, just the plumbing.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","We had floated for a while, it's basically downhole restricted flow.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Right.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the clarification.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from David Deckelbaum with KeyBanc.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions guys and nice jobs on the ops update in the quarter. Just was curious if you can give some color, you discussed sort of deferring some of the cost increases...","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","It was cut out.","Operator","I'm sorry, his line (55:46). One moment please. Okay, we have lost Mr. Deckelbaum and actually that does conclude the question-and-answer session. So I would like to return the call to management for any closing comments.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, the only thing I would say is thank you very much for your interest and we appreciate your support. We're working hard to continue to post these kind of results and look forward to continual operational updates. As you know, it's always nice to talk about results. That's what we're all about. And we look forward to bringing you additional results as the year goes on. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Karen Acierno. Please go ahead.","Karen Acierno","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2018 results and 2019 guidance conference call. An updated presentation was posted to our website yesterday afternoon and we will be referring to this presentation during the call today. The call this morning is focused on a discussion of the historical results of Cimarex and our 2019 guidance. Due to the pending transaction with Resolute, we do not intend to address matters related to the same. However, subject to the satisfaction of conditions, including the approval of the Resolute shareholders, we expect to close the acquisition on March 1. Our full year guidance assumes the acquisition of Resolute closes on March 1. We do not have comments on Resolute until after the expected closing. Also, this is not a discussion of securities involved or a solicitation of any vote or approval. You are urged to read the public filings with the SEC that contain information about the pending transaction. ","In addition, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements on our news release and in our latest 10-Q for the year ended December 31. That was filed yesterday and there is also other filings for the risk factors associated with our business. ","As always, we will begin our prepared remarks with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden; followed by an update on our drilling activities and results from John Lambuth, SVP of Exploration; and then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on operations, including production and well costs. CFO, Mark Burford, is here to help answer any questions as well. [Operator Instructions]. And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Jorden","Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everybody. Cimarex had a great year in 2018. We invested $1.57 billion in exploration and development and achieved excellent investment returns. We generated earnings per share of -- excuse me, earnings of $792 million or $8.32 per share on revenues of $2.3 billion. We finished the year strong, with solid execution and beat consensus estimates for both production and CapEx. All in all, it was an excellent year, and I salute our organization for flawless execution and performance that exceeded our targets. ","You will recall that we sold assets in Ward County in 2018, the proceeds of which will help to finance the announced acquisition of Resolute Energy Corporation. That acquisition, as Karen said, is expected to close on March 1. As we move forward into 2019, looking at our activity on a combined basis, we are committed to cash flow neutrality in 2019. Simply put, we will not borrow money. ","Our planned exploration and development capital of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion will put us in a cash flow neutral position, including payment of our quarterly dividend at a $52.50 NYMEX oil price. Before considering our dividend, we will be cash flow neutral at a $50 NYMEX oil price. However, we do not consider our dividend to be discretionary, so we internally discuss cash flow neutrality after payment of the dividend. You may have also noticed that we increased our dividend yesterday to $0.20 per share per quarter. We will have an active year in 2019, driven primarily by development projects. John will provide more detail on this. ","The work we have done these past few years has greatly increased our understanding of optimum development. Our learnings here include reservoir behavior, well interference and the project economics of multi-well developments. These understandings are a result of experiments across our portfolio including Wolfcamp, Bone Spring, Woodford and Meramec. Our conclusions on well spacing and incremental economics are not obvious, but we are confident that we can find the value sweet spot in developing our assets. Our 2019 plan includes projected exploration and development capital of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, 85% of which will be invested in the Permian Basin. Our total production is expected to increase 18% at the midpoint, including oil growth of 23% at the midpoint year-over-year. As a result of the progress we have made, we have a multiyear outlook where our assets and organization will deliver good growth and free cash flow at a $50 NYMEX oil price, including the dividend. ","I would like to refer you to Slide 10 in our latest presentation, where we present a 3-year cash flow sensitivity at a $50 and $55 NYMEX oil price. Our assets can generate cumulative free cash flow after the payment of our dividend of $100 million to $600 million over the next 3 years while delivering oil growth averaging 15% per year. The chart on the left is a comparison of cash flow over the last 3 years versus our outlook for the next 3 years. We will be spending about 20% more capital on average, generating about 35% more oil growth on average and see a potential swing of over $1 billion from outspending $532 million over the 2016 to '18 period to generating $100 million to $600 million in free cash flow during the period 2019 to 2021. ","The $600 million in free cash flow at $55 NYMEX oil is 11% of our total cash flow we expect to generate in that period calculated as a percent. Cimarex has hit our stride. 2019 will be another year of solid execution. We're seeing the benefits of our emphasis on science and innovation as well as our organizational capability and focus on economic returns. 2018 was a year that showed our ability to execute as planned. In 2019, we will do it again. With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss some of the highlights.","John Lambuth","Thanks, Tom. During the fourth quarter, Cimarex invested $380 million in exploration and development activities, bringing the total for 2018 to $1.57 billion. $1.3 billion or 86% was invested into drilling and completion of new wells. These investments yielded excellent results for Cimarex, including growth in both reserves and production. We drilled or participated in 349 gross, 122 net wells in 2018, with 70% of our capital spend in the Permian region and 30% in the Mid-Continent. ","For 2019, our estimated total exploration and development capital is $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, with $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion going toward the drilling and completion of new wells. This amount of drilling and completion capital represents 83% of our total exploration and development investment. We currently operate 11 gross rigs, with 10 in the Permian region and 1 in Mid-Continent. We plan to spend approximately 85% of our drill and complete capital in the Permian in 2019, with the rest going to the Mid-Continent region. This capital investment will result in a total 83 net wells brought online during 2019, with our company-wide average lateral -- operated lateral length increasing from 7,512 feet, which was the 2018 average, to 9,050 feet. ","Now on to some specifics about each region. I will start in the Permian region, where we brought on 40 gross, 32 net wells in the fourth quarter, bringing the total for the year to 80 net wells. A very significant delineation well brought online in the fourth quarter was our first Third Bone Spring landing test located on the western part of our Culberson acreage block. The Kingman 45 State Unit 3H had an average 30-day peak production rate of 2,917 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 1,965 barrels of oil per day. This outstanding result continues to expand the prospective hydrocarbon window for the Upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County, which will lead to greater development well densities for this area. ","Another significant result for this quarter is the Crawford 27-26 FEE 2H, located on our Southern Eddy County acreage block we call White City, and I'll refer you to Page 16 in our investor presentation for its location. This 10,000-foot Upper Wolfcamp delineation test achieved a peak 30-day average rate of 2,455 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 1,701 barrels of oil per day. This step-out well helps confirm the strong rate of return opportunity we have in this Southern Eddy acreage position. ","Also coming online in the fourth quarter was the Animal Kingdom infill development, which consists of 8 10,000-foot laterals testing the equivalent of 14 wells per section. These 8 wells achieved a combined peak 30-day average rate of 3,500 barrels of oil per day and 81 million cubic feet of gas per day, these being 2 stream numbers. Although we do not have any Lower Wolfcamp developments planned for 2019, the early results from this project would suggest future Lower Wolfcamp developments would be planned at spacing much tighter than the previously announced and successful 6-well per section Tim Tam pilot. ","We have allocated 85% of our capital to the Permian region in 2019, which equates to a 5% increase in absolute spending over 2018. We have a total of 9 development projects spread across our Delaware Basin acreage position planned for '19, all of them targeting the Upper Wolfcamp interval. Five of these are located within our Culberson joint development area. Planned spacing for these 5 pilots will vary from 8 to 12 wells per section, depending upon the overall thickness of the hydrocarbon section for each project. Three more development projects will come online in Reeves County, Texas, and one more development project will be drilled on our highly prolific Red Hills acreage block located in Southern Lea County, New Mexico. All 4 of these projects will be drilled at the equivalent of 12 wells per section. ","Finally, our average operated lateral length in the Permian has increased from 7,617 feet in 2018 to 9,169 feet in 2019. So although we have 14% fewer operated wells versus 2018, our laterals are 20% longer, resulting in a 4% increase in total lateral feet drilled for the year. ","Now on to the Mid-Continent. In the fourth quarter, the Mid-Continent region brought online 6 net wells bringing the total for the year to 42 net wells. Of note was the 10,000-foot Meramec development project called Dupree, which was drilled at 3 wells per section. I refer you to Page 22 in the presentation for the location of the Dupree. Average 30-day peak rates for the 2 additional development wells were 2,972 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 1,574 barrels of oil per day. Our better understanding of the in-place hydrocarbon potential of the Meramec is leading to better well spacing decisions for the rest of our undeveloped Meramec position. This year, we will be completing and bringing online three Meramec development projects in the second quarter. The spacing for these three projects varies from 3 to 5 wells per section. And then finally, due to the size of the project and resulting capital required, the previously planned Leota Woodford infill development project for now will be delayed until possibly 2020. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph Albi","Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'll touch on the usual items, our fourth quarter production, our Q1 and 2019 full year production guidance and then I'll finish up with a few comments on LOE and service costs. As Tom mentioned, we ended 2018 with a very solid quarter for production. With 38 net wells coming online during Q4, our reported net daily equivalent volume came in at 251.3 MBOEs per day, beating the upper end of our guidance and setting new records for company and regional production, and those are records in all product categories. Oil production drove our strong quarter-over-quarter production ramp, with our Q4 oil volume coming in at 79,900 barrels per day, surpassing the upper end of our guidance range by nearly 2,000 barrels a day. With Q4 in the books, our reported 2018 full year equivalent and oil production volumes exceeded our guidance ranges that we gave last call and reflect strong year-over-year production gains, with our 2018 reported equivalent volume up 17% and our oil volume up 18% over 2017. ","So looking forward into 2019, our forecasted production model reflects our focus on the Permian and incorporates, really, 3 primary inputs. One is a constrained capital investment, which is tied to cash flow neutrality at $52 NYMEX oil. The second is the transition into a much smoother completion cadence. And third is our continued investment in high rate of return drilling projects. Our drilling and completion capital assumptions that we've used in the model are based on late 2018 total well cost estimates and include approximately $80 million for program-related infrastructure such as SWD and power, as well as a little extra windage for select science projects such as pilot holes and upsize frac experiments. As such, the recent potential well cost reductions I'll touch on in just a bit are not built into our current 2019 capital spending projection. The model integrates the addition of the Resolute volumes beginning in -- on March 1, and reflects a slowdown in our Q1 net completions as we transition into the smoother completion cadence I just mentioned beginning in the second quarter. The result is lower 2019 drilling and completion capital and a net completion count lower as compared to 2018, with our projected first quarter volumes flat to Q4 '18, followed by quarter-over-quarter production growth beginning in the second quarter. For Q1, we're projecting our net equivalent daily volume to average 245,000 to 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with an oil volume in the range of 75,000 to 81,000 barrels of oil per day, both virtually flat to Q4 '18, but up significantly from a year ago, with our projected first quarter equivalent volume up 19% to 25% and our oil volume up 15% to 24% from our reported Q1 '18 volumes. ","With our net completion cadence projected to increase and smooth out beginning in Q2, our 2019 net equivalent daily volumes are forecasted to average 250,000 to 270,000 BOEs per day, with our full year net oil volumes projected at 78,000 to 88,000 barrels of oil per day, both up significantly from 2018, with our 2019 equivalent volume projection up 13% to 22% and our full year oil projection up 15% to 30% over last year. ","Switching gears to OpEx. With our Ward County properties now off the books and also with the reduction in our expense workovers during Q4, as well as the ramp in production that we saw in Q4, we posted a great quarter for lifting costs in the fourth quarter. Our Q4 lifting cost came in at $2.87 per BOE, well below the low end of our guidance range that we gave of $3.35 to $3.80, and down $0.92 or 24% from where we were in Q3. ","As we look forward into 2019, with continued market cost pressures on items such as SWD and compression, our increased 2019 Permian drilling focus and the acquisition of the Resolute properties, we're projecting our full year lifting cost to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.70 per BOE. With the Resolute properties added to our books beginning in March, on March 1, we're projecting Q1 '19 to likely come in at or below the full year guidance range I just mentioned. ","And lastly, some comments on drilling and completion cost. On the drilling side, with rig rate increases we talked about last quarter now in place, we've managed to hold the drilling portion of our AFEs in check since our last call. But on the completion side, we recently realized additional cost decreases in both the Permian and in our Mid-Continent programs, via service cost reductions, local sand sourcing, water recycling, zipper fracking and by challenging the completion design for each and every one of our programs. As a result, we've just recently lowered our total well cost AFEs. The majority of our 2019 program is focused on the Wolfcamp in the Permian, where depending on area, interval, facility design and frac logistics, our most current Wolfcamp 2-mile AFEs are running $10.4 million to $12.9 million. That's down $500,000 from our estimate last quarter. ","In the Mid-Continent, with a refined completion design and local sand pricing now in place, we've just lowered our 2-mile Meramec total well cost $500,000 with a new range of $10 million to $11.5 million. That's down more than $1.5 million from the cost we quoted a year ago. ","As I mentioned just a bit earlier, with us just now on the forefront of realizing these potential cost savings, they have not been fully incorporated into our current corporate planning model for wells we have yet to drill and complete. So in closing, we had a great Q4, beating the upper end of both our equivalent and oil production guidance ranges. With the mark, we closed 2018 with solid year-over-year equivalent and oil production growth. We further improved our overall cost structure with significant drops in both lifting cost and development cost. We're in great shape to execute a disciplined 2019 capital program, with our entire organization focused on optimizing cost and continuing to generate profitable growth. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Tom, I have a quick question on capital efficiency. Perhaps it's a bit simplistic, but what we did was we looked at your E&D budget in '18 versus '19, and we just divided by the number of wells or tills you're projecting in '19 and just compared it to 2018 actual. So if you just looked at this on a per well basis, the costs go from just under $13 million to $17 million. I know lateral lengths are increasing some, but I just wondered if you can discuss that increase as well as the drivers of the capital efficiency improvement that you're modeling in 2020 and 2021 versus 2019 levels?","Thomas Jorden","Well, I'll tee it up and then I'll turn it over to Joe to give you detail. But Arun, one thing I'll say from a very high level, is we are absolutely committed to live within cash flow. And that means we don't want to borrow money. So if there is a bias in our numbers, it's probably a little bit to the upside. We didn't want to come in with a capital that's flying close to the ground, because then if we were to go over that number, we would end up going into a debt situation. So we've actually built in a little money into our program for potential cost overages. We see them every year. We do occasionally stick tubing on a drill-out. We do occasionally have to sidetrack a well. And so we've looked historically at what that is and we've built in a little bit of windage there. But I'll say, I know there is a little bit of confusion. We do have some infrastructure dollars. We have some facility dollars. But when we look in our internal numbers, we do not see a per unit cost increase. So we would push back on that there is a decrease in our capital efficiency. And then the last thing I'm going to say before I turn it back over to Joe, is we have a fairly rigorous project internally going on right now, looking at our cost, trying to squeeze what we can out of reengineering our programs. Some of it's not up for grabs. We build facilities that are clean, they're safe and they're built to last. But with that, I'm going to turn it over to Joe.","Joseph Albi","Yes, Tom, I'll elaborate a little bit further on what Tom mentioned about the windage. We've got capital in our current model right now, number one, that's based on later AFEs in the year that we were putting together. And very simplistically, on the frac side, I can tell you that we've seen about a 20% reduction in our frac cost per foot since late Q3 to current today numbers. And so to the extent that those higher completion costs are built into the model, there's a little bit of bias on the conservative side there. When we break out the capital and we deduct the infrastructure cost and we compare the cost per foot, per lateral foot to 2018, we're seeing actually at the total company level, a slight reduction from where we were in 2018. And lastly, what I'll say without trying to quantify numbers exactly, at any given year, with the number of multi-well development projects that we have, we have capital that may be spent at the latter part of the year that doesn't reflect itself in the number of wells that are brought online during that year. And we have some capital in our model, obviously, that's associated with our 2020 program that, doing the simplistic calculations you are doing, may not be the correct way to take a look at it.","Arun Jayaram","That's helpful. And my follow-up, Tom or John, I was wondering if you can give us an update on your thoughts on exploration and potentially broaden out the portfolio beyond the Permian, Mid-Continent. The 10-K did confirm that you have a reasonable position, looks like 130,000 acres, in Louisiana now, for similarly, for the Austin Chalk play. I was wondering if you can maybe comment on those 2 points.","John Lambuth","Arun, this is John. I guess I didn't realize our 10-K was disclosing that. News to me, but yes, we do have a -- we've been able to accumulate a very nice acreage position in Louisiana and we are actively pursuing an exploration idea there. And that's what we always do. And as we've often said, if indeed any of that is impactful, we have good results at some point, then we will speak more to it. But yes, we have accumulated position there and then we'll see, okay?","Thomas Jorden","Arun, our goal is to grow our assets. And we think doing it organically is our preferred way. If we can find a bolt-on that makes sense, we love it. And that's what the Resolute deal is. But I want to say growing our assets can mean a lot of things. Certainly, exploration is an important part of that. Leasing, finding new ideas, extending our footprint, and we're always working on that. But you know, there is also an opportunity to grow our assets by understanding our development and getting our well spacing right and then opening up new target zones. And I just want to reemphasize a couple of things John said. That Third Bone Spring well in Culberson County is a whole new target zone that overlaps over our asset in Culberson County. That's a significant new data point for Cimarex. That was a well that had a fair amount of risk attached to it. In fact, that was a creative geological and engineering idea. If you look north up dip, where you would think the oilier part would probably reside in a basin-wide fashion, those same landing zones are wet. And yet down dip, we had a geological idea that maybe we were in the right part of the basin for it to be oil bearing. We tested that well and it was a remarkable success. And that interval maps and overlaps over almost most of that entire asset. So we want to grow our assets, and we want to do it through creative internal science and we -- as always, we need to do more of it, but I just -- I want to point out there's a lot of ways to do that.","Operator","The next question will come from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker","Tom, I was hoping you can talk a little bit about how your priorities for use of free cash flow are, in your mind, ordered right now? And how you may plan to increase that return of cash over the next couple of years?","Thomas Jorden","Well, our first priority is to execute and generate it. And so we're pretty confident we can do that. Yes, you know we're going to continue to grow our dividend, we're committed to that. And that's taking, a not insignificant part of our cash flow. As we look ahead, we're just going to have to see. I mean, first thing we have to do is demonstrate that we can execute and bank that cash. We will be running our cash on our balance sheet down post Resolute closing. So after we close on Resolute, we won't have the cash in our balance sheet that we're used to over the last couple of years. I'll say what one of our directors used to say, and that's \"Cash does not spoil.\" I mean, we don't like to keep cash on our balance sheet, but that said, we're not always nervous about it, either. We'd love to find additional bolt-ons, and we are committed to return cash to shareholders. So that will certainly be forefront of our mind. But first and foremost, we need to execute and generate that free cash.","Andrew Venker","Understood, Tom, thanks for the color. I guess just as a follow-up, have you thought about the form that might take in addition to dividends, whether -- maybe special dividend or buyback?","Thomas Jorden","Well, yes, of course, we think about it. We think about it constantly. We get asked about it. But I don't have anything new to say on that than what we've already said. We are committed to our owners. We understand who we work for and that's what our plan is all about.","Operator","The next question will come from Douglas Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kalei Akamine","This is Kalei Akamine on for Doug. I've got a couple of questions here. So the 2019 plan really looks like a full pivot to the Permian Basin. And obviously, that's positive for oil growth, cash margins and so forth. But the shift in activity also begs the question just how core is the Mid-Continent to our portfolio? I'm wondering if you can address how the Mid-Con fits into your future plans, which now appear framed by $50 CapEx?","John Lambuth","Well, this is John. I'll take a stab at that. First off, without a doubt, given the disparity between oil and gas price, Permian shines relative in a portfolio manner to our Anadarko Basin. And we have much better oil opportunities in Permian than we do in Anadarko. Now that said, there are oilier opportunities in Anadarko. The other thing, though, is that's leading to this investment decision is Permian is much further ahead in our confidence to be able to deploy this capital in a full development mode and achieve both the volumes and the returns. We're further ahead of the game there in the Permian and in fact, I think we demonstrated that strongly in our fourth quarter, with the number of the development projects that we were able to bring on, on time, and even in some ways, exceeding our expectation in volumes. And a lot of it was Permian. So a lot of confidence in our ability to deploy that capital right now in Permian and get it done. And then the last thing I'll say is in Anadarko, we don't really have any obligation that we have to spend in terms of maintaining our acreage position. We still have a pretty significant amount of capital that has to be deployed in Permian and we're happy to deploy it to maintain our acreage position. So all of that led to this year's investment decision. Not with all that said, I will tell you that in Anadarko, we are challenging that region to come up with the type of development projects that will compete with Permian, and we'll be working on that throughout the year. And I fully expect to see them fighting for capital as we go into 2020.","John Lambuth","Yes, I'll just add to that. Anadarko Basin is a wonderful basin. It's pressured, it has multiple targets, multi-pay. If we had to come up with a punch list of what we're looking for in new basins, Anadarko Basin fulfills almost all of them. And in addition to that, the State of Oklahoma, as is Texas and as is New Mexico, are places where you can plan your business and deal with a regulatory environment that's constructive. And so I just want to tell a little bit of history here. In 2009, we laid down all of our rigs in the Permian Basin, and we challenged the organization there to figure it out and come up with things we wanted to do. And they came up with a novel new idea in Lea County called Second Bone Spring, drilled a horizontal well and we were off to the races. So we've issued a similar challenge to our Anadarko region to be creative, look through that basin, find things that compete for capital. We're a highly competitive organization, both externally and internally. And I am highly confident that we're going to surprise to the upside in what we can find and do in the Anadarko Basin.","Kalei Akamine","Given the plan for 2019, what kind of decline do you expect for the Mid-Con BOE and natural gas?","Thomas Jorden","We're pointing to Joe for that. He's looking at, yes. He's pulling his papers out, yes.","Joseph Albi","Yes, overall, at a BOE basis, we're projecting that 2019 might be down 5% to 7% in the Anadarko. And most of the majority on the equivalent growth side is obviously on the Permian side and that's 35% plus.","Kalei Akamine","Awesome. Just as a follow-up, I was wondering if you can speak to the gas takeaway situation in the Permian Basin. Now in the Permian, you guys have some really powerful oil assets, but they just happen to produce a lot of natural gas. So given your yield, your insights in value, do you see this market evolving in the near term as important? Just wondering if you can talk to your expectations for pricing? And since then, you've also finalized 2019 plans, can you give us an update on your projected Permian sales agreement through December 2019, which I think previously stood at around 98%?","Joseph Albi","Yes, this is Joe, and I'll make a few comments and hand off to Mark with regard to what we're seeing differential-wise in the basin and if that leads into hedging or whatever. But on the gas side, nothing has changed. We've secured those same sales arrangements. We're very comfortably sitting at about 97% of all our residue gas in the Permian through pre-sales arrangements through the first quarter of 2020. We wanted to go out and beyond 2019. I'm sure you know that there is expansions in takeaway, in not only the gas side by the end of Q3, but also on the NGL and the oil side. We've had really no issues on the liquids side. Our NGL production is linked to sales at the processing facilities with the processors for whom either have purchaser-backed or established long-term sales arrangements in place for those volumes. And likewise, on the oil side, same situation with who we are selling to. 78% of our oil is on pipe. All of our -- I shouldn't say all, about 90% of all of our first quarter and second quarter oil new wells are going to be put on pipe. So we're anticipating that percentage to go forward. But more importantly, it's on pipe with people who have pipe out of the basin, and we've got sales arrangements put in place with them. So we feel comfortable, as we did 3, 4 months ago, about the position that we're in to get our products sold. And from my end, I haven't seen any real changes in that regard. Mark, I don't know if you want to speak to what we're seeing on the differentials?","Mark Burford","Sure. Kalei, this is Mark. Looking at differentials using the forward strip for Panhandle Eastern -- or for Waha and a passive Permian, you know, we're looking at it in $1.50, $1.25 for the next couple of quarters. Improving in the fourth quarter, it's up $1. Annual difference for '19 is looking at right around $1.25. I will point out we are about almost 40% hedged for calendar '19, with Waha and the passive Permian collars. And that's obviously, in the range of those -- those collars are in a range of $1.45 to $1.80-type range collars. We do have some portion of our realization covered with collars in the Permian. And as you look out into '20, you look at the forward strip, that price continues to improve with some of the pipeline expansion, so.","Operator","The next question will come from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.","Jeffrey Campbell","First question is on, going back to Mid-Con. Since it had to fight for capital, you've described that, can you add some color on the locations that have made the grade? Are these discrete Woodford Meramec locations? Or will there be some multi-zone development of the 2 together?","John Lambuth","Well, as I said in my remarks, we have 3 sections' worth of development that we've already drilled and we'll be bringing on in the Meramec in the second quarter. We very much look forward to the returns we'll get from there. We think we're spacing those wells appropriately and we think those type of wells are leading to kind of capital that can compete. I think the bigger question is just we have a number of great opportunities, especially in the Woodford. But typically, for those type of opportunities, they take a lot of capital. Honestly, when we go to develop Woodford, it's a large capital investment and the kind of cycle time we see there. Right now, we kind of like what we, again, have coming out of Permian in terms of our ability to deploy that capital and get that capital refresh rate quicker. Other than that, there is good investment opportunities, but again, we're just trying to get to the point where we're more confident in making those investments and how ultimately they'll compete versus these Permian development projects.","Thomas Jorden","Yes, I'll just add to that. One of the issues in the Woodford, in the Woodford, in much of our Anadarko portfolio, really is generating very, very nice returns. But the Woodford is a different reservoir than many of the other reservoirs we play with, in that it is subject to well-to-well interference phenomenon. And that means that if you're going to do a development, a 6- or 8-well development, which may be perfect for the Permian, is something you really want to be suspicious of in the Woodford. And that's because you want to protect your boundaries. And because of well-to-well interference phenomenon, it does lend one to consider larger projects. And that's one reason that's contributed to our capital allocation, in that a lot of the same things we have teed up and ready to roll in the Woodford, although good returns are just larger chunks of capital.","Jeffrey Campbell","I appreciate that color. First of all, I apologize, I missed the earlier part of the call, if you'd already covered some of that.","Thomas Jorden","No problem. You missed some very eloquent remarks.","Jeffrey Campbell","But that actually brings up an interesting point and that's that you've discussed, I know '19 is not a big year, but you've discussed that you want to start to move to more of a multiyear type of planning cycle. And once you kind of have that -- have comfort with that in place, would that actually lend itself to making the kind of investment you've talked about in the Woodford a little bit more practical as opposed to right now?","John Lambuth","No, absolutely. In fact, as I said, we have plans as we look forward into those multiyears. Because again, as Tom said, when we look at the different metrics that we like to see on a development project, there are a number of Anadarko projects that look attractive. It's just, again, the amount of timing it takes to get those put together. And as Tom alluded to, also working with your offset partners to get everybody lined up to get it moving forward. So it just takes a little more upfront planning, which ultimately could lead to some good investments, again, probably in 2020 for a number of those projects. That said, they still have to compete with Permian development projects. And we're always going to hold that level of making sure we're making the best investment that we can.","Thomas Jorden","This is a high-class problem, because our Anadarko assets are, by and large, all held by production. So we do have the luxury to stage it as we see fit. Yes, I know it looks odd from the outside looking in, but from our standpoint, it's a pretty nice problem to have.","Jeffrey Campbell","Right. And just to follow up on what you had said earlier, it sounds like then, having discussed this, the challenge that you're going to make to your Mid-Con team is to try to figure out how to get cycle times down to as short as feasible. Is that right?","John Lambuth","I think cycle time is one aspect, but more importantly, as Tom alluded, and trust me, we spend a lot of time, we look very carefully at these well-to-well interference things we see on development projects. And quite frankly, we have a lot of energy going toward taking steps to minimize the impact, say when you come develop next to an existing development and wells in the ground. And so yes, just a major change in that, and I'm kind of excited by some of the things we're looking at. If we can just get more comfortable with that, that then would allow us to design the type of developments that would get us to quicker cycle times and refresh rates. So they're up to the challenge, as Tom said, and we're putting a lot of energy into it. And if we can have just a small breakthrough on some of these things, they'll be competing, for sure.","Jeffrey Campbell","I appreciate that color, because I think the simple minds' thing is just, well, if it's $50, and if this doesn't work. But it sounds like there is, obviously, a lot more involved and also problems that you can solve. I certainly took note of the Third Bone Spring well in Culberson and just wanted to ask a couple of quick questions. One, how many wells do you feel like you need to drill to get a good handle on prospectivity throughout your Culberson acreage? And so far, does this Third Bone Spring zone have any communication with any lower zones? Or does it seem capable of standalone development?","John Lambuth","Well, the answer to your first question, yes, we do now, as much as we have mapped its extent, and I think Tom alluded to that, it looks very prospective. We do now have a number of wells across the breadth of our Culberson position that we're going to be teeing up over the year to further delineate that as a landing zone. I can't really -- as part of your second question, I can't speak to just overall, let's say, vertical communication and drainage, because this was just one well. What we will be doing quickly in the near future is in some of our developments, we'll be adding this as a landing zone and then trying to determine how much is it draining relative to other wells, and then that will then lead to further decisions about the ultimate number of wells we'll put in this section. Suffice it to say, it's very encouraging and exciting that we have been, over the years, pushing that upper landing zone higher and higher up in the section, which certainly is going to lead to more wells per section as we go and continue to develop this acreage position.","Operator","The next question will come from Jeanine Wai of Barclays.","Jeanine Wai","My first question is on the three year guide. You previously commented that you wanted to level out the completion cadence and that it would take a couple of quarters to get there. And it looks like you're probably getting there in the back half of this year. With CapEx being roughly flat over the next 3 years in the plan, what does the oil growth trajectory look like when you get out to 2020 and 2021? And I guess, specifically, do you see continued improvement in your capital efficiency such that you could see flat or maybe even sequential growth in 2021?","Mark Burford","Yes, Jeanine, this is Mark. In the '20 and '21 period, as you get out past '19, we are still working to get those cadence of predicted completions more steady and into those periods as well. But we do see, and as we discussed, in that 15% kind of annual growth in oil averages that period. So but we're still working those plans, this initial kind of run-through those outer years, are still working '20 and '21 as we speak. But it's in that -- the cadence is in those years also improving in a flatter cadence and a steady growth. But it is improving through '21 through efficiencies that we can continue to have more portion of our capital in full development. And see, as we do see capital improvements, efficiency improvements through '21.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then my second question is on the Wolfcamp, and apologies if I missed this somewhere else in the call. But we noticed in the presentation that the returns for the Upper and the Lower Wolfcamp in Culberson County have declined since the last update. And can you just talk about maybe what's driving this change? Is there some kind of change in the spacing assumption, or maybe the completion technique that might also assume -- have a similar effect in other parts of your portfolio? Or is this just a one-off?","Karen Acierno","Jeanine, I'll jump in and answer that. So we run those sensitivities every -- I think this was six months ago that we updated it. So what happens is we use these forward-looking type curves and it's a blend of type curves across the acreage. What might not be included in here are some of the upper zones and things like that. But it's really just adjustments to types curve. They may have come down, but in fact, they're all still very high. So I wouldn't get too concerned about movements and be more interested in just the improvement at -- with price. And even the Lower Wolfcamp has good returns at -- I'm turning to look at John -- so at $50 oil, right? So let's say $45, which would be our $50 cage, so. It's just something that we've had in there for a while. It's slight changes in type curves that would cause those adjustments from quarter-to-quarter.","Thomas Jorden","As soon as we hang up, we'll put the old and new curve on top of one another on the light table, if we still can find a light table.","Operator","The next question will come from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann","Tom, given your comment about focusing more on organic growth, could you talk about how just your thoughts going forward on further consolidation, not only in the Delaware, but I think in the past, you mentioned DJ and other things, just in a broad sense, any colors or comments you might have on that?","Thomas Jorden","Well, I'm probably going to be pretty predictable in my answer. I think consolidation can make great sense. It can make the best sense when the assets that get consolidated are better off in the hands of the consolidator than they are in the original owner. And certainly, our 2 transactions in '18 were all about that. We -- Ward County was better off in the hands of the purchaser. It wasn't competing for capital and they'll pay more attention to it. And we're pretty excited to be bringing in the Resolute assets for the same reason. And so I think consolidation can make sense. Now the consolidation can't be looked at in absence of the price. So we would be very interested in consolidation, but only if it's a value-creation type transaction. So we're always in the hunt. We've been in the hunt for years. We'll continue to be in the hunt. We're delighted to be closing Resolute next week. If there is another one that makes the kind of sense that Resolute does, we'd love to find another bolt-on, but they are few and far between, because we want to create and add value for the Cimarex shareholder.","Neal Dingmann","Great, great details. I thought you'd kind of go down that line. And then one last one maybe for Mark or John, just on overall CapEx of the -- I think the $1.35 billion, $1.45 billion you've got for '19, guys, how much of that is for some of that exploration, either newer plays like Louisiana, I guess, that you've outlined now in the K, or just any other areas?","John Lambuth","Well, this is John. We don't really -- like I said, a, we hardly ever talk about those type of rank wildcat opportunities, but even b, all -- if indeed, we embarked on a particular drilling well, it would be so small relative to $1.35 billion, $1.45 billion, that it would be a rounding error. It's not like we're out there drilling 10 of these wells. They're very strategic and what we do typically, I don't even know that we spend much time in terms of budgeting for them. These are more just unique opportunities that we see. And I would, again, argue that they tend to be more of a rounding error on the overall E&D capital that we lay out for this overall company.","Operator","The next question will come from Betty Jiang of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Betty Jiang","Can you please talk about what type -- some of the activities that you're doing in 2019 in preparation for 2020? It does seems like production growth improves in 2020 for a similar CapEx level. So just wondering if there are some high grading of the program from one asset to another? Or if any high-impact program that you can point to?","John Lambuth","Well, this is John. I guess, all I can tell you is, and is, and I think Joe alluded to this, we have a lot of drilling activity going on towards the latter part of '19 on a number of development projects throughout our Delaware Basin position that will contribute greatly to '20 that do not come on in '19. Some of them are -- yes, some of them are on some very good acreage positions. But I don't know that, that necessarily would lead to a significant change in the oil growth. I do expect over time, but I don't think we've modeled that in, things such as taking advantage of existing infrastructure, and we do look at that, but other than that, I'm not sure what would lead to maybe the conclusion you are coming to. I don't know, Mark, or...?","Mark Burford","I guess I would also comment is that I don't think we see necessarily '20 as being an outsized benefit. '20 and '21, even more in the '21, as our model moves more to full development, and some of that spacing and some of the benefits we do see from -- benefits of multi-pad development in '21 is probably even a bit more of an improvement as opposed to just '20.","Betty Jiang","Got it. No, that's helpful. And then can you talk about how you're thinking about capital allocation split between the Permian and the Mid-Con between 2019? And can we get a sense on what is the activity level needed to keep Mid-Con oil volumes flat?","Thomas Jorden","Well, I can handle the former. I'll let Mark or Joe handle the latter. It's a jump ball here for capital allocation. We really want to generate the greatest value in any given year. And although we have some projects that have great continuity, we look at it fresh every year, and as I say, it's a jump ball. If we have better opportunities for creating value in one basin over another, that's where we want our capital to flow. We've got lots of long-term opportunity in both basins. So that -- we think that's a prudent way to approach it. Particularly to the extent that our assets are held by production and not requiring us to do anything other than flow capital to where it's most productive. So the fact that we're putting 85% of our capital in the Permian this year doesn't necessarily presage what's going to happen in next year.","Karen Acierno","Although I think that the three year plan makes that assumption, but to Tom's point, it's a jump ball. So anything that we would -- any changes we would make, we would think, would make it better.","Thomas Jorden","Mark, you want to...?","Mark Burford","Yes, the only comment I'll make, just on capital, but we do, on the 5-year -- on the three year plan, it does have still a good proportion amount going to the Permian, nearly 80% going to the Permian, and '20 and '21 as well. So as far as the trend has a breakeven oil forecast, I don't have a statistic on what the capital for breakeven Anadarko oil forecast is. But I'll just comment, again, it's still these plans are continually being evolved and as Anadarko were to compete for more capital, these plans would continually evolve. But if anything, they'd be going to be improved as we high-grade and continue to see better opportunities.","Thomas Jorden","Yes, a plan is formed at a particular point in time. So as this point in time looks, yes, we look at the next three years and say it will be overwhelmingly Permian heavy. But as John said earlier in the call, we've really challenged our group to find some things that compete. And if and when they do, our plan gets modified.","Operator","The next question will come from Noel Parks of Coker & Palmer.","Noel Parks","I wanted to just ask you to talk a little bit about Lea County. I know it's a relatively small part of your budget for the year, but in the release, it talked about you have 3 really good wells, Third Bone Spring about, almost 1,500 barrels a day IP. So I was just wondering sort of about your expectations there for you going forward? And as for those wells you reported, I think 30-day IPs, just getting a sense of roughly when those were drilled? Are they just at the beginning of production? Or is this over a number of months?","John Lambuth","This is John. I think the wells we made reference to are all drilled across our Lea County acreage. They're Third Bone Spring wells and most of them were brought on in the middle of the latter part of the fourth quarter. So we achieved 30-day rates, thus we could give you those averages. We still continue to hold a nice inventory. Third Bone Spring drilling, what's really nice about Third Bone Spring, is we talk about this in terms of cycle time, we can drill them one at a time. We don't like to do that, we like to at least do 2 wells, so that we can go multi-pad. But there is great flexibility with that program. The biggest issue you have is just whether your permits and whether you get them lined up soon enough to get that going. We have quite a bit of investment going on in Lea County, not just further Third Bone drilling, but we have a couple of really nice development projects, one that I already mentioned, which is Wolfcamp in Red Hills. And then later in the year, we'll be doing a Avalon development as well in the Red Hills area. So a good portion of our capital is going to Lea County. We see great returns there and we're very pleased with the position we have there.","Noel Parks","That's terrific. I was wondering, just turning a bit back to the Mid-Continent. I know you talked a lot about just the relative economics and everything, but I was just curious, at this -- at this stage of the play of the STACK at Meramec, have we hit a horizon where there is a fair amount of expired leases on the horizon where I was wondering if you were seeing anything like farm-in opportunities for people who can't get to their -- their leases out there, sort of a low-hanging fruit in that play for you?","John Lambuth","This is John. In general, I'd say the answer is no, because at the initiation and the enthusiasm of the STACK play, just about every operator, just like us, went after and drilled at least one well on every section to get at HBP. So for the most part, within the areas that you care about the Meramec, or STACK, I would argue that no, I don't think you're going to see that big a churn, in that most of that acreage now is held by production. And it's just a matter of timing as to when people go forward and develop the acreage.","Thomas Jorden","It's also a fairly active arena for a handful of small, well-funded private equity players.","John Lambuth","It is.","Thomas Jorden","And that's increased competition.","Operator","The next question will come from Mike Scialla of Stifel.","Michael Scialla","Tom, I know you said you can't say anything about the Resolute acquisition, but there seems to be a lot of concern about your projected decline in capital efficiency in 2019 versus '18 and then anticipated improvement in 2020 over 2019. I know Resolute put out an 8-K here recently saying they anticipated first quarter production volumes, at least on the oil side, were actually going to be down from fourth quarter. I assume they kind of put things on hold once the acquisition was put in place, because I know they were forecasting a pretty steep ramp prior to the acquisition. Is it fair to say that some of the capital efficiency changes you are seeing here are in relationship to -- will you are going to have to fight a steep decline when you take over this acquisition? Does that have an influence on the numbers people are seeing there?","Thomas Jorden","Well, I don't know if it has an influence on capital efficiency, but look, we love this asset. We know it well. It's in our focus area in Reeves County. But I want to be clear, Cimarex is going to live within cash flow in 2019. Now the Resolute team did a fantastic job with that asset, but they were also on a fairly significant outspend. And so when we combine those two assets, when I say we're going to live within cash flow and not borrow money, that has an impact on both assets. It just logically does. So you can do the arithmetic and figure out what that means. And we look forward to being able to talk about it in a fuller way at the end of our closing next week. But we'll have a fair amount of activity, but the fact that we're going to live within cash flow and we're committed to that is certainly an overprint here.","Michael Scialla","That makes sense. I want to see if -- I know there's just early data at this point, but anything you can say on Triste Draw, with the 20 wells per section test in the Avalon? And what kind of tests are you planning for the Vaca Draw area in terms of the Avalon? Is it a similar 20-well per section test there?","John Lambuth","Yes, this is John. We obviously are still watching the Triste very carefully. We knew, I'll just be very upfront, we knew going into it that we were pushing the upper limit on spacing there. But sometimes, that's good to do, because I'd rather get that answer right away, so that I can really hone in on what's optimal. I think it's fair to say that for the landing zones we chose for that Avalon test, 20 wells was too tight. But that's okay. We still have a lot of additional acreage, and we're taking that learnings, that we then optimize our plan, say, like I mentioned earlier, for the Vaca Draw section, where we will be developing Avalon. We have not finalized now what that spacing will be in the Avalon. We're looking at the Triste results as well as other competitor results. I hope to, in the coming months, we'll settle on exactly what's the best way to develop that Avalon in that area. What I do know is when properly spaced, Avalon generates some of the best rate of returns out there. It's a phenomenal reservoir for us. But you definitely want to be careful in terms of not overdeveloping it. So we'll take those Triste results and then here in the near future, we'll settle in on what's the right path forward for us, especially with the upcoming Vaca Draw Avalon pilot we're going to -- development pilot that we're going to do this year.","Operator","The last question today will come from Phillip Jungwirth of BMO Capital Markets.","Phillip Jungwirth","I was hoping you could provide some more color on around the performance drivers as outlined on Slide 10. And maybe specifically, hit on the increasing well productivity and the lowering of the production capital cost?","Thomas Jorden","Well, I'll take a stab, and I'm sure others will chime in here. As I look at this list of our performance drivers, certainly, program efficiencies are a big piece. As we go into multi-well development, it really keys off to the third point of leveraging infrastructure. We have a lot of capital required with our program. The fact that our operating costs are so low is really a function of smart investments. And so saltwater disposal is one of those. The right facility sign -- size is another. Taking advantage of multi-well pads, all of those are strong performance drivers. And with development mode, you really can maximize the efficiency and leverage that. Well productivity is still a big part of our story. That's not only on a per well basis, but that's understanding new landing zones. And even a new landing zone can allow you to stagger your wells and make each well more productive. And then we're really focusing on engineering lower costs. We'd love to have lower cost from our vendors, but we're also looking at how can we engineer to shave 5%, 10% off our cost structure. So these are things that are real. They are things that a good learning organization should focus on and we're absolutely focused on that. And Joe or John, do you want to comment on that?","John Lambuth","The only thing I'd add is from my perspective, we've made quite a bit of investments in our infrastructure, to the point now that -- and more importantly, that we've become very comfortable with the full development opportunity of the breath of our acreage that we're at a point now where we can pick and choose where to develop where we maximize the existing infrastructure. That then minimizes our upfront cost as we go forward and bring forward each of these development projects. We are just hitting our stride in that regard. I think more than ever, our drilling program, in some ways, is no longer being driven, say by acreage needs or obligations or maybe even a particular attribute, but more so by our existing infrastructure and taking advantage of that so we can keep our overall per costs down. And Joe, as well...?","Joseph Albi","Yes, all these things we're talking about go into cost efficiencies. And you've heard Tom and John both mention leveraging our infrastructure. I'll give you an example that kind of coincides with us transitioning into smoother completion cadence: Our Brokers Tip and Sir Barton development projects. At the end of the year, we had 28 wells waiting on completion and just 6 coming on here in Q1. We intentionally pushed out those 2 development projects so that we could operate with one frac fleet so that we can make sure that we are fulfilling 100% of our water needs by recycling the water for those projects. In other words, we could have accelerated the crews, but then we would have had to haul water and buy water to finish the deals. So what it ended up doing was, I think it was 2\/3 of our total well cost now on the completion side, we're really focusing on how to optimize all those costs. In that case, those wells slide into Q2, it's going to give us a smoother production cadence. It's going to help us save money. The drilling group is constantly focused on days to TD. They're challenging themselves with casing designs. On the completion side, John and our stimulation guys are constantly challenging ourselves on how to get cost down. I mentioned a few statistics that we obtained in that regard. Zipper fracs can save us anywhere from $200,000 to $400,000 per well when we can do them. Recycling, $0.5 million on a Wolfcamp well and what we're doing with local sand is having a big impact on our program, too. So these are all things that are in our working, day to day, with every one of our groups that's focused on cost efficiency.","Phillip Jungwirth","Great. And then in the prepared remarks, you commented about how the number of Delaware wells per section will be fewer in 2019 than some of the second half of '18 pilots. And I was just wondering how much of the change in development is driven by a shift in thinking around balancing rate of return and NPV versus reposition -- or positioning the company for $50 oil or maybe performance of second -- some of the second half pilots?","John Lambuth","Well, I want to make -- this is John, and I'm clear that I believe that in my opening comments, I didn't really, in any way, infer less spacing in the Permian, more so in the Mid-Continent and specifically in the Meramec section, where we're going down anywhere between 3 to 5 sections versus previous expectations people had of 8 to 12. If anything, because of our now opening up this Third Bone Spring interval in Culberson, we would tend to lean more forward to more wells per section in our Delaware position. So I'm not sure what comment you're referring to.","Thomas Jorden","But I'll just follow up that we have a strong economic philosophy on our developments. We are a learning organization, and even as John said, things like the Triste Draw, where we see that we drilled the -- our wells probably in hindsight a little closer than optimum, we don't just look at that like we've touched a hot stove and back off. We study it, we look at the elements of well-to-well interference, both from a rate of return and net present value. And our team was up here last week looking at another Avalon development. And they -- we were just so pleased with the thoroughness they brought to that recommendation. We look forward to sharing some more data on our philosophy there as the year goes on. It's an outgrowth of a lot of the science we've done in the last couple of years. I think you'll find that the conclusions are not obvious and that when you tear it apart and we're able to be more forthcoming with how we view our development, construction and design, I think you'll see that a lot of the effort that we've put into this has been really, really worth it.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Tom Jorden for any closing remarks.","Thomas Jorden","Yes, I just want to thank everybody, there's been some great questions. Hopefully, we provided some color. We look forward to a further update once we get the Resolute acquisition closed, but I want to thank you for your interest and really just congratulate our organization on a great quarter and a great 2018. Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day."],"5380":["Cimarex Energy (NYSE:XEC) Q1 2014 Earnings Call May  7, 2014  1:00 PM ET","Executives","Mark Burford - Director of Capital Markets","Thomas E.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Burford, Vice President of Capital Markets and Planning. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Burford","Thank you very much, Marie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our first quarter conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; John Lambuth, Vice President -- and John Lambuth, Vice President, Exploration. We also have Paul Korus, CFO; and Karen Acierno, on hand here today as well.","We issued our financial and operating results release this morning and also a release regarding a new acquisition that we announced yesterday after the close. And a copy of the news releases can be found on our website, along with the latest presentation, which we may refer to from time to time today on today's call.","I need to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause the actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read and -- you should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K, other filings and news releases for risks factors associated with our business.","So we have a lot of to cover today, so I'll go ahead and get the call turned over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden","Thank you, Mark, and thanks to all of you for participating in today's conference. We sincerely appreciate your interest in Cimarex.","I'd like to take a few minutes to touch on some highlights for the quarter, before turning it over to John and Joe for a more detailed update. Our success in the quarter, I think, is best described with one word, and that's innovation. Innovation resulted in dramatically improved results in our Cana-Woodford play, which led to record production of 740 million cubic feet equivalent during the quarter, up 12% over last year, but more importantly, up 13% sequentially, which was well ahead of our guidance. This extraordinary success in Cana came from the implementation of upsized completions and some better-than-expected results from a workover program.","These results were a key driver in our decision to purchase additional Cana assets, a transaction we announced yesterday. Upon closing, we'll have spent approximately $250 million for 140 Bcf-equivalent approved reserves and, more importantly, 50,000 net acres, of which 30,000 are in our Cana focus area. With this transaction, we were able to increase our position in the field where we are a dominant player at a time when we are rediscovering its potential. We're experiencing significant uplift to our returns in Cana from an upsized frac, returns that compete with those in the Permian. In addition, we see additional upside in this acreage, including the Merrimack potential.","As you know, we, at Cimarex, seek a return on investment capital, and we're somewhat agnostic as to whether those returns come from oil projects or gas projects. We think it's to our advantage to be a multi-basin company with a portfolio of opportunities. Every now and then, you articulate a strategy, you articulate a philosophy and you occasionally get to demonstrate it by living it. What I want to say is that we've become very heavily Permian-weighted, and I'll -- we'll talk about that a lot in this call, but one of our challenges to our organization over the last 9 months to 1 year has been let's find other areas to get returns that can compete with the Permian.","We manage Cimarex and we manage our program by having a diverse exposure to a number of different play types, a number of different commodity types, and we believe the company is made stronger to have the flexibility of picking and choosing as opportunities arise. We had some extraordinary success and I attribute that to our team in the Mid-Continent working Cana, with their completion innovation and also some workover innovation. And as we sit today, we think our Cana program competes head on with returns with our Permian program. And that is an absolutely wonderful outcome.","Now it's also gratifying to raise our guidance and give an increased growth trajectory and communicate it to you. But I want to say again, and we've said this before, this is about return on investment capital and not about a growth target. And we're delighted to be facing a landscape where we have returns on invested capital in the Permian and in the Mid-Continent area that can compete head-to-head, that gives us the flexibility to adapt to market conditions and any constraints in this growing industry environment. So I want to be clear, this purchase and our excitement about Cana has not altered our plans for the Delaware Basin. We are right on track, and you'll hear about some significant new results.","Innovation has resulted in Cimarex continuing to make great wells and see improvements in our completion techniques in the Delaware Basin as well. One thing we like in particular are the results we're achieving with long laterals. So much so, we're now moving our program to drill long laterals wherever possible. We've put a lot of energy into building a land position that allows for long laterals. And this year, in 2014, approximately 40% of our Wolfcamp wells will be drilled with long laterals.","Our acreage position in Culberson County, which we solidified by our joint development agreement with Chevron, provides the perfect platform for long laterals. Today, we announced our second long lateral in Culberson County, drilled to the Wolfcamp D target, the well was the Gallant Fox, completed using a 10,000-foot lateral and a 43-stage completion. Despite some initial pipeline constraints, that well had a 30-day average production rate of over 2,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","With long laterals in mind, we added to our acreage position. We added 45,000 net acres to our Wolfcamp play fairway in the first quarter, including 35,000 acres in Reeves County. Now some of that acreage was added through new leasing. Some of it is added through an expansion of our fairway. We had a couple of fairly significant wells that industry competitors drilled in Southern Lea County, and that allowed us to recognize additional acreage that went into our Wolfcamp fairway.","Our pilot program continues. We're flowing back our Wolfcamp C and D stacked lateral tests in Culberson County. And our completion of our 4-well 80-acre pilots in Culberson and Reeves are underway and on target. We'll share those results with you later in the year.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to John Lambuth to discuss details of our drilling program.","John A. Lambuth","Thanks, Tom. I'd like to quickly cover some of the highlights of our overall program before getting into the Permian region. I'll then finish with our Mid-Continent region and the results in Cana.","Cimarex drilled and completed 74 gross, 36 net wells during the quarter, investing $467 million. 67% of this investment was in the Permian region, with 29% of it in the Mid-Continent. Of those 36 net wells, 21 net wells were in the Permian region, where we continue to be focused on the Bone Spring, Avalon and Wolfcamp formations in the Delaware Basin.","Bone Spring activity in the first quarter included 13 net wells in New Mexico and Texas. Results continue to be good, generating some of the company's highest rate of returns, with oil volumes representing up to 84% of the first 30 days of production. Our Bone Spring program for 2014 is comprised of 56 net wells, which results in a total investment of $375 million. We continue to have about 200 to 300 Bone Spring locations identified on our acreage in New Mexico and in Culberson County, where we have identified a thick highly productive 2nd Bone Spring sand.","At the beginning of the year, we announced a new drilling program in the Avalon Shale in Lea County, New Mexico. Results to date have been very good. The 9 Avalon wells drilled-to-date have a 30-day average IP of 1,003 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with oil making up 77% of the production from these wells. We have an inventory of over 200 locations and plan to drill from 15 to 20 wells in 2014.","About half of our Permian drilling capital in 2014 or about $685 million will go toward further delineation of Cimarex's Wolfcamp opportunities in the Delaware Basin. This includes downspacing pilots and wells drilled to hold acreage. As Tom mentioned, we now have 225,000 net acres identified as prospective for the Wolfcamp Shale, up from the 180,000 net acres we discussed during our last call. This is the result of both acquisition of additional acreage and a slight redrawing of the Wolfcamp fairway outline due to recent well results. You can view our new fairway outline in our updated presentation materials.","We are currently producing from 6 distinct Wolfcamp zones across the 225,000 net acres we've defined as our Wolfcamp fairway. While they may have the same name, they have very different characteristics across the play. We define them as the Wolfcamp A, C and D zones in Culberson, the Wolfcamp A and B\/C in Reeves and the Wolfcamp A in Ward County. We currently have wells producing from all of these Wolfcamp zones.","As Tom mentioned, one of the innovations of the first quarter was the proof of concept of long-lateral drilling in the Wolfcamp. We now have 9 long-laterals wells producing across our acreage and expect 40% of our 2014 Wolfcamp wells to be long laterals, which we defined as being longer than 5,000 feet. Over half of the Culberson County Wolfcamp wells will be long laterals, with 14 in the Wolfcamp D, one in the C, and one in the A, and another 13 long laterals are planned in the Wolfcamp A in Reeves and Ward Counties.","A couple of examples of the recent success we've had with long laterals includes a well we announced today and then one that Tom mentioned earlier, the Gallant Fox, which had a 30-day peak IP average of 2,516 barrels of oil equivalent per day. It is our second well in Culberson County to incorporate long-lateral drilling and upsized fracture stimulation. The 10,000-foot long Gallant Fox well was completed with 43 frac stages. Typical of a Wolfcamp D well, it has a product mix that is comprised of 646 barrels of oil, which is 26% of the production; 6.9 million cubic feet of gas a day, which equates to 45%; and 730 barrels of NGL per day, or 29%.","In Reeves County, we recently completed a well we call Thunder, which had a peak 30-day IP rate of 1,411 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the Wolfcamp A. This well was a 6,400-foot long lateral and was completed with 30 frac stages. This rate is 50% higher than our standard 5,000-foot lateral with a 12-stage completion. Like other Wolfcamp A wells in Reeves County, the Thunder was predominantly oil, which made up 50% of the production.","Lastly, in the Delaware Basin, I'd like to give you an update on the status of the 4 unique pilot programs we currently have underway. I'll refer you to our presentation for an illustration to the designs. Our first pilot to be drilled and completed is the stacked lateral test in Culberson County. These wells are testing the concept of producing from laterals stacked in Wolfcamp C and D. These 2 wells have been fracture stimulated and have just started the flowback on them. The 2 4-well 80-acre downspacing pilots, one in the Wolfcamp D in Culberson and the other in the Wolfcamp A in Reeves County, are both in various stages of completion. Once all 4 wells in the pilot are completed, the wells will be put on production and begin flowback. The fourth pilot is in the Wolfcamp A in Reeves and is considered both a stacked and staggered, as it will test the downspacing and the viability of landing more than one lateral in the thick Wolfcamp A section. We currently have 2 rigs drilling this 6-well pilot. As scheduled today, all the wells and all of the pilots should be on production sometime in the third quarter.","Now onto the Mid-Continent, where we have perhaps our most exciting news for this quarter. We are pleased to report that our efforts to bring the upsized completion to our development in Cana has been highly successful. To illustrate, I'd like to direct you to Slide 18 in our latest corporate update posted on our website. This graph compares the traditional Cana infield completion with our aptly named Golden Section, the first section completed using an upsized frac. Results are strikingly similar to those we've experienced when we upsized the frac in Culberson County. This upsized frac had a positive impact on the initial production, the recoverable reserves and, most importantly, on the returns. Investing an additional $700,000 increases our before-tax internal rate of return from 38% to 86%. And our NPV10 more than doubles from $5.5 million to $14 million.","At Cimarex, we like having options. And based on our results so far, these wells most definitely compete with our returns in the Permian, giving us more places to invest capital for good returns. We have 2 more operated sections on the schedule to be completed in 2014, and we look forward to reviewing our future plans as we get further confirmation of upsized frac results in Cana.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph R. Albi","Thank you, John, and thank you, all, for joining our call today. I'll touch on the usual topics. Our -- first, our first quarter of '14 production. I'll discuss the remainder of the year from a production outlook standpoint and follow up with a brief discussion on our operating and service costs.","We truly had a great Q1, reporting average net daily equivalent production of 740 million cubic -- equivalent cubic feet a day, a record for the company and 30 million a day above the upper end of our Q1 guidance which was 696 million to 710 million. Both Cana and the Permian played a role in us exceeding our guidance, with Cana being the real driver.","The step-change in performance that we've seen using upsized fracs in our new Cana completions played the biggest role on our production beat, while we also saw some nice increases in our Cana-based property production as a result of a number of well-bore cleanouts and remediation projects that our production team performed during the quarter. The bottom line is, Cana just simply well exceeded our plan expectations.","In the Permian, our new well forecast held very tight to plan, while our Triple Crown pipeline turnaround project went about as smooth as it can go and, therefore, resulted in less downtime on the system than we had expected. And it also played a role in helping us to exceed our guidance.","With a nice jump in our Q1 production, we were up 5% from our Q4 '13 average of 705 million a day and 12% over our Q1 '13 output of 661 million a day. Driven by Cana, Q1 ended up being a quarter of records for us in the Mid-Continent, where we set regional records for all product categories: gas, oil, NGL, total liquids and equivalent production. Our Q1 Mid-Continent equivalent volume of 371 million a day was up 28 million a day or 8% over where we were in the fourth quarter and 11 million a day or 3% from the levels we saw a year ago.","With the nice quarterly gains in Cana, our Q1 Cana volume of 255 million a day was up 30 million a day or 13% from the fourth quarter, and it actually set a new record for us once again in the play. And with that level of production, Cana continues to play a vital role in our overall program. It now makes up 69% of our total Mid-Continent production and more than 1\/3 of our total company volumes.","In the Permian, we continued to see nice production growth during the quarter as well, with our Permian Q1 net equivalent volume of 347 million a day, up 4% or 15 million a day from Q4 '13, and up a very respectable 26% from the 275 million a day we averaged during Q1 '13. Oil continued to provide the growth for us in the Permian with our Q1 Permian oil production of 31,624 barrels per day, up 7% sequentially from Q4 and 22% from 1 year ago.","During the quarter, we completed 22 net wells in the Permian. That well count was constrained a bit by our Wolfcamp spacing projects that John mentioned, which are projected to come on in the late Q2, early Q3 timeframe. And as a result, our net completions in the Permian are currently modeled to accelerate from 22 in Q1 to levels of 35 to 45 completions per quarter as we end out the year. With this pickup in completion activity, our modeling is showing that our Permian production growth should accelerate beginning here in the Q2, Q3 timeframe.","Looking forward into our guidance. With our continued successes in Cana and in the Permian, our updated model is now projected -- is projecting a full year 2014 guidance range of 822 million to 847 million a day. That's up significantly from our beginning year range of 760 million to 800 million a day, and it reflects a very healthy 19% to 22% growth in our production over 2013.","I want to make special note here that this range does not include any volumes from our recently announced Cana-Woodford acquisition, and that acquisition will add about 35 million a day to our books and on top of these numbers upon our anticipated closing, which is slated for June 30. And obviously, following closing, we'll include these new volumes in any future guidance updates that we provide to you.","As might be expected from the tone of this call, the increase in guidance from 760 million to 800 million now up to 822 million to 840 million (sic) [ 847 million ] is nearly all driven and attributable to what we're seeing in Cana. As John mentioned, we've seen a solid step-change uplift in well performance, pumping larger fracs. In addition, our production group has done a great job of increasing production from our Cana-based properties by identifying underperforming wells and performing a variety of cleanout and wellbore remediation projects. That work really kicked off in late February and March, and we didn't see a full quarter's worth of that work. But the work that we did perform equated to approximately 6 million to 8 million a day to our Q1 Cana production volumes, and we expect that to increase as we close out the year. In a nutshell, both our exploration and operations teams are virtually hitting on all cylinders to boost production coming out of Cana.","We also continued to see strong results from the Permian. With the number of Permian completions projected to accelerate in Q2 and Q3, our current model projects that Permian oil will jump from our Q1 levels of 31,625 barrels per day to well over 40,000 barrels of oil per day for an average in Q4, quite a jump with more than 60% of our fourth quarter projected oil coming from the wells that we drilled this year. So that gives you an idea of the impact that our new wells will be having on our oil production.","So with our successes in Cana and our projected acceleration in the Permian, we've got just a wonderful springboard as we jump into Q2 here. And it's reflected on our Q2 guidance, which is projected at 810 million to 830 million a day, and that's a projected increase of 9% to 12% over just the first quarter. So as our volumes continue to grow, things we worry about, product takeaway remains high on our priority list. In that regard, Culberson -- in Culberson County, we're working alongside Chevron to evaluate proposals currently on the table for a third-party construction and operation of an oil-gathering system in our Triple Crown project.","In all areas of the Permian, we're expanding the number of purchasers and haulers that we use to truck our oil out of the basin. As a result, we've recently added 3 new purchasers and are evaluating additional proposals from a handful of others. And although we feel the pressures of increasing oil supply coming out of the basin, as I'm sure all of our peers in the basin are also feeling, we continue to be successful, lighting up our production with sales all the while that we've been able to add new purchasers. In general, the pricing term for receiving reflect the WTI Midland-based pricing. And when we do see some gravity adjustments, we do find them to still be in the modest range.","We're also working diligently on the gas takeaway and processing side in all the core areas of our activity. As an example, I'll use Triple Crown. Along that Triple Crown pipeline infrastructure, we now have 6 available markets for gas takeaway and processing as compared to just one option that we had years ago when we started in the area. Our marketing and midstream groups are doing a great job to work side by side with our exploration and production teams to ensure that we're building out infrastructure as far ahead of our activity as we can, and ultimately providing for takeaway.","Shifting gears to OpEx. Our Q1 lifting cost came in at $1.13 per Mcfe. That was at the low end of our full year guidance range of $1.12 to $1.22 and right in line with our 2013 average of $1.13 per Mcfe. Although we saw some cost pressure during the quarter in items such as chemicals, compression, power and fuel, our per-unit operating expenses benefited from our stronger production, obviously. And as a result, we've brought down the top end of our production expense range for full year to $1.18, putting our revised guidance for lifting cost for this year at $1.12 to $1.18.","A few words on service costs. We continue to see most costs on the drilling side to stay relatively in check, including our day rates, which, for 1,500-horsepower top drives, have been holding in the $22,000 to $25,000 a day range for multiple quarters now. That said, top drives do seem to be in short supply. And with that, we are seeing that the number of new builds seem to be going up. But with service costs flat, our drilling team is continuing to focus and is successful on doing what they can to reduce our cost through operating efficiencies, and we continue to see that in most all of our programs.","On the completion side, we've seen some modest cost pressure from a tightening market for equipment. But most of the cost pressure has come on the transportation side, particularly in the transportation of prop when we're pumping these bigger jobs. That said, any real significant cost increases that we've seen on the completion side have come directly associated with us pumping bigger jobs, more stages, more fluid, more prop. And as a result, the completion component of our AFEs can now make up more than 60% of our total well cost in programs like Cana in the Mid-Continent, and in the Avalon, Bone Spring and Wolfcamp in the Permian. Our recent well results, however, are telling us that the incremental benefits are certainly well worth the additional cost.","From a total well cost standpoint, incorporating the upsized frac into our new Cana well design puts our current Cana core AFE at the $6.9 million to $7.2 million level. That's up from the $6.3 million to $6.5 million level we saw early in Q1. With the smaller fracs -- on the smaller fracs in Q1, the increase that we've seen has been entirely attributable to the upsized fracs. And as a good example of this, we've made just tremendous strides on the drilling side in Cana over the last 6 to 9 months. And it's very well evidenced by the fact that our current AFE, including the large frac, is running about where we were all-in for the small frac in Q3 '13.","In the Permian, AFEs for a 4,500-foot lateral, 2nd and 3rd New Mexico Bone Spring wells continue to run in the range of $5.7 million to $6.5 million, depending on depth. That's flat from last quarter and down about $400,000 to $500,000 from where we were a year ago. In our shallower Texas 2nd Bone Spring program, our AFEs are still in the $5.1 million to $5.5 million range. We've bumped the upper end of that range from last call by pumping a little bit larger-sized frac, but that's still down about $0.5 million from where we were a year ago. And our current Avalon wells are running in the $7.2 million to $7.5 million range, incorporating the larger frac.","As we continue to experiment with upsized fracs in our Wolfcamp program, our current AFEs for a 4,500-foot lateral are in the $8.5 million to $9 million range, that's depending on the geographic area and the size of the frac, while our 2-mile Wolfcamp laterals, our AFE are in the $13 million to $14.5 million range, again depending on the size of the frac.","So in closing, we're off to a great start here in 2014. Q1 production came in very, very strong, and it gave us a wonderful springboard into Q2. And with that, we've raised our full year outlook for production. We're keeping our LOE and our service costs in check, and we're making very good progress finding ways to optimize production from the wells that we've drilled.","And with that, I'll go ahead and turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is Matt Portillo from Tudor, Pickering.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just one quick question on the Cana. Obviously, the returns you guys have highlighted here are quite impressive. I was curious if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of how you're thinking about the asset from an acceleration perspective as you move into kind of 2015 and, in particular, with regards to the recent acquisition?","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, Matt, this is Tom. We are looking at acceleration in Cana. We're, of course, kind of in the midst of a lot of moving parts here with just announcing this transaction. We're in the due diligence phase, getting ready for the June closing. We are looking at a potential acceleration that would have additional infill drilling, really would be a 2015 issue. We might get started later this year. But obviously, we have other companies to coordinate with. Cana is a multi-company arena, and no one company can just do things in isolation. So we're looking at some plans, we're lining it up and we'll get back to you when get a little more detail on it.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just a second question, kind of a bigger-picture question in terms of, I guess, both the Cana and Permian. Given the resource base that continues to expand here, I was wondering if you could maybe provide a little bit of context of how you guys think about kind of your drilling program and how it will progress over the next year or 2 in terms of the size and scale that this may move to from kind of your current position.","Thomas E. Jorden","Well -- again, this is Tom. We see -- given commodity windage, we see an accelerating drilling program. And the beauty of what we've announced today is we think we have an equal opportunity to accelerate in the Mid-Continent, in the Permian and\/or both. Now one of the things that we're concerned about, the industry is concerned about, is some of the pressures of so many Permian companies accelerating simultaneously. That leads to pressures in rigs, pressures in stimulation and other services, pressures in oil and gas takeaway and pressures in manpower. So one of the things that this allows us to do, to the extent we look at accelerating, we have a little built-in relief valve without sacrificing our return on invested capital. I mean, this is exactly the strategy Cimarex is built around. So yes, we'll -- we will accelerate. And the way we're thinking about it is we have the flexibility that we've always cherished that optimize both our returns but also our ability to execute efficiently.","Operator","Our next question is Brian Gamble, Simmons & Company.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","On the long-lateral wells, we've talked about a couple of them. You said you had 9 producing now. Any others to note anything of, or is that something the -- for later in the future?","John A. Lambuth","This is John Lambuth. Well, obviously, we don't talk about every long lateral that we drill. We just try to point out significant ones, which is why the Gallant Fox was talked about because it was a very nice confirmation of what we were able to achieve with the previously announced Montrose well. And likewise, the Thunder we talked about because besides being a long lateral, it also incorporated a bigger upsized frac. That really -- those 2 components are kind of the go-forward components in all 3 of those areas, for Culberson, Reeves and Ward. And certainly, as we get further long lateral results and, let's say, others zones that we haven't talked about, we'll certainly add more color and comments to that once we have those wells to talk about.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And on that same-well results side, the -- I'm sorry, go ahead.","Thomas E. Jorden","I was going to say, obviously, we're very encouraged that the program is moving in that direction. We don't know that every well we drill is going to be representative of the 3 10,000-foot laterals we have announced. But so far, so good.","John A. Lambuth","Yes.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And the 30-day IP rate, one of your slides, the Eddy, Lea County number moved up significantly during the quarter. Is that all upsized frac, or were you doing anything else there during the quarter versus last quarter? I think it moved up from 665 to 966...","John A. Lambuth","Can you tell us what particular page are you referring to so we'd look at it?","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Sure, of course. On slide -- let's see, on Slide 8. You mentioned the 2nd and 3rd Bone in Eddy and Lea, your 30-day rate for this quarter versus last quarter, 966 versus, I think, last quarter was 665. Is that all frac stuff?","John A. Lambuth","Yes, it is. In the Bone Spring, we haven't talked a lot about that. But we have definitely, in the Bone Spring, gone in and made adjustments to our frac design there as well. And we're seeing some nice results by doing that, especially in the White City Culberson area, and so we're moving to that frac design in that area. And going forward, that's what we'll use. But -- plus, we're still tinkering with it. We still think we can even get better results. So we're very encouraged so far from what we're seeing out of that area.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then one more, if I may. The gravity adjustment that you mentioned were modest thus far. Are you intending to just continue to lock in modest adjustments in some of these new purchasing agreements or eliminate those adjustments moving forward? How do we think about any sort of deducts that may be involved in new deals or even better pricing that may be involved in new deals?","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe. The current deducts that we're seeing are like $0.30 to $0.40 per degree gravity, and they're over different API numbers, depending on the contract. Getting long-term contracts with these guys, with our purchasers, is not as easy as, I guess, we had hoped to have it be, because I think they are concerned about the same things we are. That said, what I will tell you about our ability to get new purchasers into the game down there, we've been very successful. We've added 3 additional purchasers and all of them seem very comfortable in taking any of the gravities that we're giving them.","Operator","Our next question is Jason Smith, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just want to follow up on Brian's question on crude oil pricing again. Is that gravity issue, is that more just focused in the Wolfcamp C and D, and as you guys kind of the move up to the A, it's less of an issue?","Joseph R. Albi","Yes. This is Joe again. The only areas we're really seeing any kind of adjustment in the Permian are in the Wolfcamp, and so in the Culberson area, as well as in the Reeves. The Wolfcamp, the Culberson is little bit higher gravity. It's like 54 to 58 degree. And when you get over there into Reeves, it's 46 to 52. We've got -- let's see, we've got 3 specific purchasers that I'll speak of in Culberson. And we're seeing the deducts in one case over 45 degrees, and then the other one will take crude over 50, but it's just a little bit higher fee. So their fee jumps up about $1.50. So I don't know about...","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But all the zones you're seeing -- I mean, I know you haven't done much in the Wolfcamp A over there. But you're seeing the Wolfcamp A in the high -- in the mid-50s as well?","Thomas E. Jorden","We -- this is Tom. We do see a little lower API number in the A than we do the D and the C. But it's still what you would call light. It's in the 50s. So really, the variation we're seeing that's significant is more regional than it is stratigraphic. We'll get a little lower API number in Ward County than we will in Culberson County, and Reeves is kind of intermediate.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then in Reeves and Ward, the acreage you guys tacked on, can you just maybe give us some color on what you paid for that?","John A. Lambuth","Yes, this is John Lambuth. We added approximately, as Tom said, the 35,000 acres. And the cost for that was right around in the $2,300, $2,400-an-acre range for that additional...","Thomas E. Jorden","This was a leasing effort. It wasn't one fell swoop. This was dozens and dozens of incremental deals.","John A. Lambuth","I mean, we saw an opportunity from our -- in our explorations where we felt like we could expand the play and get more acreage, and we were able to execute upon it and add that acreage. So we're very pleased with that additional acreage position we've added to it.","Operator","Our next question is Joe Allman, JPMorgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Tom, for that Cana acquisition, why flip half of it and not keep the whole thing?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, there's lots of answers to that. Would we have been happy to keep it? Yes, yes, we would. That said, Cimarex and Devon had a long-standing cooperation out there, and we typically offer assets like this to one another. So that was part of the thinking. We also are the biggest working interest owners out there. And so both companies, I think, having a willingness to reawaken the drilling program in Cana is important to both of us. So I will say this, I was more concerned about just the willingness to invest and go forward than I was the $250 million or $500 million. We do look at our debt, and this is incremental to our debt. We have lots of inventory, and it was not a -- it wasn't a tough call for us. We're happy to offer half of it. Joe, Cana is -- just I can't underscore how pleased we are with our recent results. We're encouraged that it will translate over the widespread field, and we're going to have a long road ahead of us of just top tier returns out of Cana. The executive team, we're here in Tulsa today and we're having an annual conference with all of our technical people from around the company. And I walked up this morning and came in the middle of an argument that 2 of our junior engineers were having, one was a Permian engineer and one was a Cana engineer, and they were debating whose programs generates higher rate of return. And that's a debate that we love and greatly encourage here at Cimarex. And so we've got plenty to do here. And you know what? Yes, could we have taken all of it? You bet, but we're real pleased with the decision we made.","Operator","Our next question is Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just thinking ahead to the 2015 program, you talked about potentially accelerating in Cana. Are there any gas processing or pipeline takeaway concerns in Cana? And I guess, how many -- how much running room do you have before things become tight there?","Joseph R. Albi","Yes, this is Joe. We've taken a good, hard close look at our production wedge and the marketing arrangements that we currently have. And with our current takeaway options, we feel very comfortable getting through the remainder of this year without any processing or compression issues with our primary purchaser. We also have 3 other markets that we're pursuing now as we look forward into 2015 to try and understand our wedge there. We really -- with the '15 program, if we were to accelerate, it'd be row [ph] drilling. We'd start that in the fall, and that completion activity probably wouldn't really start to hit the books until second quarter of next year. And that would be the time that we hope to have these other potential arrangements locked up. So I guess a high-level answer is we've got plenty of breathing room that we see right now in the short term, medium term, and we're worrying about our long-term ability to get out of there.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes. And, Drew, it's Tom. the -- like anything we do, we have to look pretty far ahead and make sure that the infrastructure's ready, the market's ready, the rigs are there. And so as Joe said, we're in the process of doing that. The nice thing about where we sit right now is Permian and Cana kind of complement one another and play off one another. So any activity that's limited in one can be taken up by the other. So we're intending to accelerate in Cana, but we've got plenty to do in both basins. So we're-- we feel like we've -- today, are announcing a very significant safety valve for Cimarex in terms of our future growth profile.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just to follow up to that. Do you feel like these new Cana completions can be applied across your position, or is there anything that would keep you from being able to use the new completions across-the-board there?","John A. Lambuth","Yes, this is John Lambuth. That's a great question. That's exactly what we're attempting -- or are doing right now with our current rigs. We are both completing some additional new infill sections, which are geographically separate from the Golden Section. So that'll be a nice checkmark to show that we can get similar-type returns. And then likewise, we are out there drilling some initial parent wells or first wells in the section in areas where we're trying to reestablish what is the type of production we should expect using this new frac style. So there's a lot of delineation in a sense. It's hard to imagine me using that word. But in some sense, that is there, that we're trying to kind of recalibrate ourselves as to what type of production profile we should expect with this new fracture stimulation. And then let me also say we haven't really honed on -- honed in to actually exactly what is the best frac job. Even within the Golden Section. We changed it up some -- among a number of the wells there. And we are still experimenting some that we think we could perhaps even -- can do even better than what we have right now. So there's definitely some additional drilling and testing we need to do to just gain further confidence to how applicable this could be across the broad Cana area.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Is there any conservatism baked into your Cana production forecast, just given how much production history you have on these new completions?","Thomas E. Jorden","That's a very...","Joseph R. Albi","In all of our modeling, we're modeling what we book and -- as a starting point, and that's with our base properties. And those are based on current well productions levels and current well declines. And as we start to see better and better well results, the -- I guess the type curves of the wells that you're drilling are going to be integrated into those future wells that you drill. And those are the wells that we model off of. As far as guidance is concerned, our beginning year guidance did not incorporate the impact that these upsized fracs had because we kind of wanted to wait to see if it happened first before we go ahead and do that. And obviously, now that we've upped the ante on our Cana production for this year, we're sending the signal to the market that we're fairly confident that what we're doing is working and it's showing up in Cana. So as we continue to see results, we build those results into not only our future investment decisions, but also to what we forecast that we'll produce in our cash flow models.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes. Drew, we always estimate what we think is realistic. And is there conservatism? I mean, there's always is. And life in the oil patch can be a very humbling experience. Things tend to go wrong. So we always build in a fair amount of tolerance for either timing delays or operational issues. But yes, it is what we think we'll achieve.","Operator","Our next question is Cameron Horwitz, U.S. Capital Advisors.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","On your Delaware Wolfcamp map, can't help but notice more dots there to the east and in Ward County. Maybe a little bit early, but I was hoping if you could potentially give us a little bit of color as to how you're thinking about kind of the opportunity set over there, the relative productivity and the oil cuts on -- in the Wolfcamp over there to the east?","John A. Lambuth","Yes. This is John Lambuth. The word you used is very appropriate. It is early. A lot of those dots you see are in their flowback, and we haven't really achieved peak 30-day averages for us to talk much about them. It is definitely oilier as you get into Ward from Reeves. That trend continues into there. But we are still very early there in Ward and just trying to get a good understanding of the type of the well we're going to have there. I would hope, certainly, by next conference call, we'll have a lot more to say about our Ward County program.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of modeling for the rest of the year. With the Cana acquisition, how do we think about the average working interest there in Cana at the current pace once that acquisition closes?","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe. I'll just rattle off some of the stats, working interest-wise, that pertain to our share of the QEP sale. There were 793 properties that were in the proved category. They operated about 243 of those. We'll own an average working interest in all those wells of about 14.5% working. That is where that 35 million a day level that we've quoted in our call comes from. That production mix is about 64% gas, 28% NGLs and about 8% oil. About half those properties are in the Woodford. In the Cana area, they comprise probably 90% of the value, and our working interest in those properties is at the 9.5% level. The remainder of the properties are older vertical wells that obviously don't carry as much value as the Woodford section, and make up the balance of the deal. So hopefully, that helps kind of give you a high-level snapshot of what you're looking for.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just lastly, any evolution in terms of your view on the stacked concept? I think you alluded to a well that I think you had flowing back. Just curious if your view has changed at all from last quarter. I know obviously early there as well.","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, we're currently flowing our first Merrimack well back. And we don't have 30 days production, so we'll defer that to our next call. But we definitely recognize the potential. We follow the play carefully. As I've mentioned before, we've taken our own core. We're in the process of analyzing it. And so I would anticipate that we'll have other drilling to do, and probably 1 or 2 wells to discuss on our next call.","Operator","Our next question is John Nelson, Citigroup.","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to build on Drew's question in a little more detailed fashion, if I could, thinking back to our discussions on why 2013 production was able to beat -- I think you guys attribute it to haircutting -- the new Wolfcamp completion design as you sort of factored that into guidance. I guess is there any reason to believe that you wouldn't be following a similar practice with the new Cana completion design, or have you maybe learned a bit from 2013 and we're more in the gray area? If you could provide any color there.","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe, again. I -- we don't set off and say, \"Hey, here's this forecast. Let's haircut it.\" If we don't have a lot of wells under our belt, and we're really not certain if it's just a geographical thing or something's working versus something else, we may look at it unrisked and risked and risk certain areas other than others. So it's a very dynamic thing that I would hope that quarter-to-quarter, and I think we've demonstrated in the past, we're pretty darn tight on our guidance. And in this quarter, it was, in my mind, an exception for just a couple of extraordinary reasons. We didn't know what was going to happen in Cana. And so now that we've got a little bit of this under our belt, we're going to incorporate that into our future guidance as if it -- we think it's going to happen. And so I really just want to underscore that. We don't start off and say, \"Hey, let's just kind of really watch this thing and not put the right numbers out there.\" We got a budget and cash flow model and everything else here, too. We want to be as accurate as we can.","Thomas E. Jorden","But -- yes, I'll follow that. Joe is absolutely right. To the extent that we have meaningful data in these upsized completions, we only have a long flowback period over a fairly restricted area of the core. Now we do have a couple of outlying experiments that we're watching and we're encouraged, but we don't have the calibration that we do in the core. That's the thickest, highest gas-in-place part of the field. So we have modeled an uplift over the entire area. But until we get some calibration, we've left ourselves some room, as we need to. So we don't think we're being overly conservative in anything we're forecasting.","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's really good color, and I can appreciate, I guess, not conservatism, but not being aggressive, I guess is the way I'll put it. And then if you could just remind me what -- timing-wise with regards to Cana completions throughout the rest of the year. I think the presentation notes 2 rigs, but can we just -- should it be pretty steady, the flow of completions over the course of the year?","John A. Lambuth","Yes. This is John. We are currently actually completing our next operating section, as we speak. We have 2 sections to complete. But I would also point out that the other company in Cana has quite a bit of completions ongoing through the rest of the year that we have a pretty good interest in as well. So I would say a good rest of the year.","Mark Burford","John, this is Mark. Actually, we had 14 net completions in Cana, roughly, in the first quarter. Second quarter, we should have about 11 net completions, so fairly similar rate. Similar into the third quarter, with about 14 net completions. But it really tapers in the fourth quarter.","John A. Lambuth","In the fourth quarter, yes. The fourth quarter is where it tapers off. And that's where -- again, we have to get this closing done, but that's where we look at -- once we start ramping up, where do we do that. Although more than likely, no matter what we do, we really won't get those wells online until probably sometime first, second quarter '15. So there will be a slowdown some in the fourth quarter, but of course, we've incorporated that in our guidance.","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe. From a high-level standpoint, all these -- how all this is playing out underneath the hood, you're -- what we're seeing is fairly consistent quarter to corner -- quarter-to-quarter -- I can't say that word apparently -- Cana completion count through Q3. It tapers off in Q4 right about the same time we're starting to see the acceleration in the Permian. So where the Permian is accelerating, Cana is kind of rolling off, and the bottom line is what it is.","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's really, really helpful. And then just one last one, if I could sneak it in. It looks like you widened sort of the Wolfcamp map, specifically that acreage, and sort of Central to South Central Reeves. Are you chasing similar targets to what you have and sort of more north of that acreage, or just stay tuned or any color around that?","John A. Lambuth","Yes. This is John Lambuth. And that is the area that we went out and pursued and was able to acquire that additional acreage. And...","Thomas E. Jorden","Southern Reeves.","John A. Lambuth","Southern Reeves, as you highlighted. And that is an area that we'll be targeting our first well in later this quarter, early next quarter. But we see it as being very similar to the same section we're drilling in Northern Reeves, in terms of Wolfcamp A, as well as B\/C, as potential targets down there.","Thomas E. Jorden","And if you were to go back historically, you'd see some of our early trend maps included a lot of Lea County acreage. We skinnied it up, just because we weren't sure what it would do up there. There was 1 or 2 industry wells there in the southwest corner of Lea County that were very, very nice Wolfcamp wells, and fully made us realize that, that acreage we have in the southwest corner of Lea County is absolutely going to be Wolfcamp prospective.","Operator","Our next question is Michael Hall, Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Quite a bit have been answered. I guess couple left of mine would be -- just curious, to what extent is Devon also employing these sorts of upsized fracs and how much are you guys sharing, I guess, information on technology and whatnot?","John A. Lambuth","Yes. This is John Lambuth. Devon is applying the similar-type frac design as we are doing as well. They have interest in our wells. We have interest in their wells. So we clearly learn from each other. So they have quite a few sections now under their belt with a similar frac style and, again, quite a bit of experimentation within there, too. We're still trying to hone in on what works best. Early data on that is encouraging so far, but it's very early. But they are, themselves, also trying to apply the same frac style.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Okay. And I'm assuming -- it sounds like you guys are thinking about some acceleration. Have you been in contact with Devon around that as well for the new properties or what's the -- any commentary there?","Thomas E. Jorden","It's too early to really get too granular on that. We're just kind of talking about it at this point.","John A. Lambuth","Got to close.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","That's fair. Okay. And I just want to make sure I heard you right in terms of the ramp in Permian oil production, the prepared remarks there. In the fourth quarter, was that to over 40,000 barrels as a net number in the fourth quarter on average?","John A. Lambuth","That's correct. That's a net number for our Q4 average that we hope to exceed that number.","Operator","Our next question is Jeb Bachmann, Howard Weil.","Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Just had a question on these upsized fracs and looking at recovery factor. Is -- are you expecting these upsized fracs to essentially accelerate the recovery of the reserves, or do you also think you're going to get an increase in that recovery factor as well?","John A. Lambuth","Well, I'll take a stab at it first. I'm sure Tom will want to as well. It looks as though we are, I would say, getting a higher recovery factor for the same gas-in-place section, that's what's occurring. So I would not call it acceleration as much as we're more effectively connecting to the rock and draining that resource. That's what we think is happening.","Thomas E. Jorden","But to the extent we're getting higher recovery and higher rate, getting -- we're getting more gas out faster, so.","John A. Lambuth","Yes, yes. It's coming out faster. But we are not -- I would say, in terms of acceleration, we're not really competing with other wells. We are effectively just getting better connected to that total resource that's there in place. That's what we feel is happening.","Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","And going forward, do you guys get a sense of when you're going to be able to come out and talk about maybe increased EURs associated with this new design, or how long -- how much longer -- or how much history, I guess, do you need to establish before that?","John A. Lambuth","Yes, I don't know. It's just too early right now for us to think about when we might publish some type of EUR on that. I mean, again, what we showed you today was an early idea of the flowback data, what it looks like. You can judge for yourself the type of wells we're making there, based on that graph.","Joseph Bachmann - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And last one for me. Do you guys have a resource-in-place estimate for Reeves County, for the Wolfcamp in Reeves at this point, or it's still too early for that?","John A. Lambuth","This is John. We internally have a resource-in-place map, but I'm not really going to talk about it. Reeves County is a very competitive area. We're still actively trying to lease. So that's not something that I really want to talk publicly about.","Operator","Our next question is Nicholas Pope, Cowen and Company.","Nicholas P. Pope - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to get a little bit of granularity on the Cana wells and the upsized fracs. I want to -- I did want to clarify that -- are -- what you all -- the data that's shown, is that just a upsized frac with the same lateral length as what you all previously had been doing in the region?","John A. Lambuth","Yes. This is John. It is the exact same equivalent of a 5,000-foot lateral. And what you're seeing within that graph is an average of the well results from that section.","Nicholas P. Pope - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And do you all have just a rule of thumb? It looks like a 2-stream volume that you provided. As you all report on 3 stream, do you know what the uplift is in the Cana from the wet gas to a 3-stream profile, just volumetrically?","Mark Burford","Yes, Nick. It's approximately 20% uplift going from 2 to 3 stream.","Nicholas P. Pope - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And how many wells were included in that, in the new infills?","John A. Lambuth","Yes. That was an average of 8 wells.","Joseph R. Albi","On the graph.","John A. Lambuth","On the graph.","Thomas E. Jorden","We have completed a whole series of wells.","John A. Lambuth","Yes. But for that particular graph, that's 8 wells.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Burford for any closing remarks.","Mark Burford","Thank you, everyone, for joining. We appreciate the -- taking time to stay with us and going over our results. And then we look forward reporting to you in the future quarters.","Thank you very much.

Ma'am, you may begin.","Karen Acierno","Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Cimarex Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2017 Conference Call. An updated presentation was posted to our Web-site yesterday afternoon and we will be referring to this presentation during the call today.","Our discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause the actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business. We expect to file our 10-K for the end of the year next week.","We will begin our prepared remarks with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling activities from John Lambuth, our SVP of Exploration.

In addition to the updated Investor Relations page, we have added quite a lot of information under the Corporate Responsibility tab, especially with regards to the environment. There are new sections on Seismicity, Hydraulic Fracturing, and Spill Prevention, as well as expanded disclosure on Water Management and Air Quality. So we hope you find it useful and appreciate any feedback you might have.","So, with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden","Thank you, Karen, and thank you for everyone for joining our call. Cimarex had an outstanding year in 2017. We invested $1.28 billion and achieved excellent investment returns in both the Anadarko and Permian basins. Our overall program returns were excellent by historical standards. Our operating group delivered seamless execution in 2017 as we avoided operational hiccups that plagued many of our peers.","Our investment and operational performance led Cimarex to achieve top line annual production growth of 19%, including 27% growth in our oil production. More importantly, we achieved a 15% growth in debt\/adjusted production per share and 13% growth in debt\/adjusted reserves per share. We accomplished this while living within cash flow and cash on hand. All in all, it was an excellent year and we [exclude] [ph] our organization for accomplishing these results.","Our challenge now is to do it again. Our 2018 plans call for us to invest $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, 70% of which will be in the Delaware Basin. The remaining 30% will be directed to highly profitable Woodford and Meramec projects in the Anadarko Basin. Our top-tier assets near Anadarko and Delaware basins and contiguous land positions provides for greater capital efficiency as our programs further move into development projects.","We expect to deliver 11% to 16% total production growth and 21% to 26% oil growth in 2018. Once again, as in 2017, we plan to achieve these results within cash flow and cash on hand. In 2018, oil sales will account for 62% of our revenue, NGL sales for 19% of our revenue, and residue gas sales will account for 18% of our revenue. Our ongoing emphasis on the Delaware Basin and the liquids rich portions of the Woodford and Meramec plays will continue to balance our exposure to swings in commodity prices.","In developing capital plans, we also look hard at the percentage of total capital that goes into drilling and completion. Setting production capital aside, these drilling and completion dollars are the engine of our profitability. All other costs, which include land, midstream, saltwater disposal, and G&A, must be carried by the profitability of our drilling program.","Thus, we look carefully at the percent of our total E&D capital that is drilling and completion dollars, and the percent of our total expenditures that are drilling and completion dollars. Our 2018 program has a good mix year, well above the average for the past 13 years. Our experience guides us to view this as a key metric to sustaining long-term profitable growth.","One attribute of Cimarex is that we measure ourselves relentlessly. We take apart each of our programs and study them to calibrate our actual results compared to our pre-drill expectations. We look at actual to expected costs, actual to expected production, and actual to expected reserve bookings.","Our goal in studying these metrics is to calibrate our decision-making, understand what is and what is not working, and seek to make better decisions going forward. We cannot always control the outcome but we can control the decision. We strive to have actual to expected results that are in close agreement. This gives us greater confidence in making future investment decisions.","Our 2017 overall program exhibited strong repeatability, as measured by actual to expected results. In laying out our 2018 capital plans, this consistency of results gives us confidence to increase our pace of activity. Furthermore, we will direct a higher proportion of our total capital to Delaware Basin in 2018. This decision is driven by the outstanding returns and programmer feasibility. Simply put, these are great investments.","We learned a lot in 2017 as we experimented with numerous downspacing projects in both the Anadarko and Delaware basins. Having a footprint in each basin makes us stronger in both. Our organization is adept at bringing learnings from one basin to the other and we expect our geosciences and operations staff to stay curious.","During 2017, our understanding of well spacing, optimum completion design, landing zone selection, and optimum facility design, increased dramatically because of the pilot projects we completed. We are ready for the challenge to repeat that operational excellence in 2018.","Finally, I'd like to make a few comments on our value creation thesis. Cimarex has long held to the thesis that our goal is to increase net asset value per share and that the best way to do this is to reinvest our cash flow in the most profitable projects we can find. There is an ongoing conversation among energy analysts and investors that this is an indictment of the industry for destroying value through the commodity cycles. We are highly sympathetic to the spirit of this to date, although we do not think this was a one-size-fits-all approach and that we do not think that's the appropriate response.","Each company needs to respond in a manner that fits their assets, their investment performance, and their balance sheet. If our sector is guilty of destroying capital through the cycles, we do not necessarily think the solution is to do less of it. We think the solution is to fix the core problem.","How can we invest through the cycles and create real value over time, this is Cimarex's focus. We perform an annual look-back on every year, every program, and every well we have drilled since the inception of Cimarex in 2003. There are over 4,000 wells in our look-back. We take each well and bring it current with actual production over time, actual revenue received, and actual expenditures incurred since it was drilled. This look-back is a critical part of calibrating ourselves and making sure that we understand our real value creation over time.","There is a treasure trove of data within our annual look-back and we mine it thoroughly. We look at the impact of commodity prices, actual to expected production, actual to expected reserves, and actual to expected expenditures. This analysis helps us understand the relative influence of each factor in our value creation. We are in the business of investing and this analysis identifies where we are doing well and where we need to do better. We are fully committed to value creation and we understand that it is not measured by growth.","We are confident that our 2018 capital program is the right solution for Cimarex. We are achieving top-tier returns on invested capital and the 2018 program will continue that momentum. Service cost inflation is a factor as we look into 2018 and we have factored this into our plans. And as I said, we are in the process of incorporating lessons from our look-back in order to protect our investment returns.","Our commodity downside stress test on each investment we make is a critical discipline point for us. We will be discussing lessons from our look-back more fully as the year goes on. Nonetheless, we are confident that our 2018 capital program will deliver robust full cycle returns and is the right answer for Cimarex.","Enough of the preamble, we have some exciting results to update you on today. We had a great year in 2017 and look to repeat it. Our strong 2017 results calibrate our acceleration into 2019. We are seeing the benefits of our emphasis on science, our organizational capability, and the focus on fully burdened investment returns that permeate our culture.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John Lambuth","Thanks Tom. During the fourth quarter, Cimarex invested $344 million in exploration and development activities, bringing the total for 2017 to $1.28 billion. $980 million was invested into drilling and completion of new wells. These investments yielded excellent results for Cimarex, including growth in both reserves and production. We drilled or participated in 319 gross, 98 net wells in 2017, with 59% of our capital spent in the Permian region and 39% in Mid-Continent.","As you've heard, our 2018 plans estimate total exploration and development capital at $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, with $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion going towards the drilling and completion of wells. This amount of drilling and completion capital represents 82% of our total exploration and development investment, up from 77% in 2017.","We currently operate 14 gross rigs, with 10 in the Permian region and four in Mid-Continent. We plan to spend nearly 70% of our drill and complete capital in the Permian, with the rest going to Mid-Continent region. Mainly due to increases in working interest, in particular higher working interest in Permian than Mid-Continent, these 14 operated rigs will be drilling 28% more lateral feel than the 13.25 average gross operated rigs drilled last year.","Now I'll turn to some specifics of each region. I will start with the Permian region. We completed and brought online several Permian spacing pilots in 2017. The Tim Tam pilot, which consisted of five 10,000 foot laterals at equivalent of six well spacing in the Lower Wolfcamp came on production early last year and has yielded a great result with a calculated after-tax internal rate of return of 67% for this project.","Drilling is underway on the Animal Kingdom infill development in Culberson County, which consist of eight 10,000 foot laterals, testing the equivalent of 14 wells per section by both decreasing the space between wells in a bench plus adding an additional landing zone in the top part of the Lower Wolfcamp. These wells are expected to be on production around midyear.","Another important test, the Seattle Slew pilot, has now been on production for 120 days. These six 7,500 foot wells tested equivalent of 12 wells per section in the Upper Wolfcamp. The learnings from this project along with the results of the other two Upper Wolfcamp spacing pilots of Gato and Sunny's Halo which tested six and eight wells per section, have enabled us to gain greater confidence on how best to design the ultimate development spacing for the vast majority of our Culberson County Upper Wolfcamp position. We have five development projects planned for the Upper Wolfcamp across our acreage position in 2019, with two of them located in Culberson County.","Lastly, I want to talk about the increased activity we have planned in Lea County, New Mexico. In the fourth quarter 2017, we started drilling on our Red Hills acreage block two 10,000 foot laterals in the Upper Wolfcamp and three 10,000 foot wells in the Avalon interval. These wells will assist us in the confirmation of the appropriate frac design for this area.","We have also begun drilling a spacing pilot in the Upper Wolfcamp that will test the equivalent of 12 wells per section within one bench and we have spud an Avalon spacing pilot that will be testing the equivalent of 20 wells per section in a stack\/stagger pattern within one zone. All of these wells are expected to have first production around midyear 2018. This is an exciting area where due to our high percentage of contiguous acreage, we have the opportunity to develop with 10,000 foot laterals.","Now, onto the Mid-Continent. We had a very productive year at Mid-Continent region during 2017. We completed the obligation drilling associated with our Meramec position and now hold all of our 115,000 Meramec acreage by production. I will refer you to Slide 24 of our presentation as I discuss some of the recent highlights in the region.","First, we completed a three well stacked Woodford\/Meramec test in the 14-10 township in Canadian County, Oklahoma. This test called the Woolfolk\/NIB confirmed results of our Leon Gundy spacing pilot and it included two [landings] [ph] in the Meramec and one in the Woodford. Further, this test shows that changes in cadence of the well completion has had a positive impact on overall results.","Another Cimarex-operated Meramec test nearby, the Mike Com 1H-1720X had a very encouraging result with an average 30-day peak IP of 4,353 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 10% was oil, 29% NGL, and 61% gas. Cimarex operates nearly all of the 24,000 gross acres within the 14-10 township area with an average working interest of 62%.","For 2018, we intend to operate four Meramec development projects across our acreage position. Based on math variations within the Meramec interval as well as ours and other operators' recent pilot results, these development projects are being custom designed for each section in order to maximize both returns and present value. Thus, the range of spacing that we will be drilling is from 3 to 10 wells per section, again based on the thickness of measured hydrocarbon in place for each section that we will develop.","Drilling activity continues in the high return Lone Rock area where Cimarex has six long lateral Woodford wells on production with average 30-day peak initial production of 1,806 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 35% of which is oil, 36% gas, and 29% NGL. The Company is currently drilling the Shelly spacing pilot in Lone Rock with first production expected mid-summer and has plans for a second spacing test with JD Hoppinscotch later this year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph R. Albi","Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll update you on the usual items of our fourth quarter and our full-year 2017 production, our outlook for 2018 production, and then I'll finish up with a few comments on LOE and services costs.","As Tom mentioned, we had a solid fourth quarter from a production standpoint. With reported equivalent volume of 1.204 BCF per day, we came in above the midpoint of our guidance and set Company records for all products in both the Permian and Mid-Continent regions as well as at the total Company level.","With mark, our equivalent production was up 5% over Q3 2017 and 25% over Q4 2016. Oil volumes drove the growth with a fourth-quarter net oil production of 61,771 barrels a day, up 36% over the fourth quarter of 2016, a direct result of our 2017 capital allocation focus on high rate of return liquids projects in both the Permian and Mid-Continent.","With Q4 in the books, our 2017 average net equivalent production came in at 1.142 Bcfe per day. That's up 18.6% over 2016. Strong activity levels in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent generated the growth, resulting in nice year-over-year net equivalent production gains in both regions, with our 2017 Permian posting of 631 million a day, up 25% over 2016, and our Mid-Continent volume of 509 million a day, up 11%.","Moving on to our 2018 production outlook, with more than 55% of our production now comprised of liquids and the deep inventory of high liquid growing projects in our portfolio, we're now providing production guidance and other metrics in oil equivalent rather than gas.","With our continued focus on Permian and Mid-Continent high liquids project, our current model projects our 2018 production to average 211,000 to 221,000 BOE per day, an increase of 11% to 16% over 2017. Similar to 2017, we're projecting another strong year for oil growth, with forecasted 2018 oil volumes up 21% to 26% over 2017. We also built into the model a very small property sale which we closed in January, which reduced our volumes by approximately 1,100 BOE per day.","Our 2018 program includes a significant number of multi-well infill projects in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent. Significant production contributions from our Animal Kingdom, Hallertau, Snowshoe, and Triste Draw projects in the Permian as well as our [indiscernible], Shelly and Steve O projects in the Mid-Continent are forecasted to occur during the second half of the year.","As a result, with approximately 45 net wells anticipated to come online in the first half of the year and 82 net wells forecasted in the second half of the year, we're projecting fairly flat production levels through Q2 with a strong ramp in production during Q3 and Q4. With the ramp, we are forecasting fourth quarter oil volumes to be up 29%c to 34% over Q4 2017, mirroring what we did this last year.","After incorporating our property sale and additional January Permian production downtime of about 4,000 to 5,000 BOE per day associated with weather, compression maintenance, repair, and construction related type set-ins, we're forecasting our Q1 2018 output to average 198,000 to 207,000 BOE per day, relatively flat to slightly up from our last quarter Q4 2017 and up 12% to 17% from first quarter a year ago.","Shifting gears to OpEx, our Q4 lifting cost came in at $3.89 per BOE, right at the midpoint of our guidance of $3.60 to $4.20. Our resulting full-year 2017 OpEx averaged $3.77 per BOE. That's down 5% and 25% from our 2016 and 2015 postings respectively.","To date, our production team has been able to fight off cost pressures and maintaining operating cost structure we've worked so hard to achieve, ultimately keeping our overall lifting cost somewhat in check. Looking into 2018, with the fluctuating nature of workover expenses and our liquids-rich drilling focus, we're projecting our full year lifting cost to be in the range of $3.75 to $4.35 per BOE.","And lastly, some comments on drilling and completion cost. On the drilling side, although rig day rates seem to be somewhat in check, we are seeing some cost pressures on ancillary services such as surface rentals and labor, and as a result, and again depending on area, we've seen slight increases in the drilling portion of our AFEs. As always, we continue to fight off these cost pressures through drilling efficiencies.","On the completion side, we've seen additional upward pressure in the cost per frac operations, in particular the cost for services and for proppant. As an example and on a total Company average basis, we've seen our service cost per stage pumped increase approximately 20% and our cost per proppant increase approximately 10% since the third quarter of 2017. As such, we stay focused on refining our completion designs to offset the cost increases, all the while concentrating on improved well productivity.","To reduce associated costs, we're executing zipper fracs and recycling water where we can and we continue to explore sand-sourcing potential in the Permian. To ensure crew efficiency and adequate prop sourcing as in all quarters past, we maintain a consistent number of frac leads and plan our resource needs well in advance, and as a result we've had no significant issues procuring the resources when and where we need them.","The drilling and completion cost increases has made their way into our current AFEs. In the Permian, depending on area, the interval, facility design, and logistics for frac efficiencies, our current Wolfcamp 2-mile AFEs are running $11 million to $13 million. With our New Mexico Bone Spring development now extending from the shallower areas of Southern Eddy County into the deeper areas of Northern Eddy and Lea counties, our 1-mile Bone Spring AFEs are now running $7 million to $8.5 million.","And in Cana, with the revised completion design to help offset cost increases, our 1-mile lateral Woodford AFEs are running $7.5 million to $8 million. And finally, with our current frac design, our 2-mile Meramec AFEs are running $11.8 million to $12.8 million, up from the levels we quoted last call of $10 million to $11.5 million.","So, in closing, 2017 worked according to plan. With a solid Q4, we closed the year with record production and year-over-year production growth of about 19%. Our 2017 liquids-rich focus generated sizable production gains in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent and we demonstrated 36% oil growth from Q4 2016 to Q4 2017.","With similar projects slated for 2018, our strong Q4 2017 exit rate is forecasted to hold flat until the middle of the year when our Permian and Mid-Continent multi-well infill projects are forecasted to generate another sizable production ramp, a ramp projected to result 11% to 16% year-over-year production growth and a Q4 of 2018 oil volume in 29% to 34% above our record Q4 2017 level.","We're working hard to fight off cost pressures on all fronts. Despite the pressures we've seen, we continue to generate great returns from our drilling program. The stage is set for another successful year here in 2018 and we're excited to execute our plan.","So with that, I'll turn the call open to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Drew Venker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Drew Venker","Tom, I want to start on your prepared remarks addressing costs and specifically costs other than D&C, it sounds like you think there's potentially some evidence to reduce those in the future. Maybe you could speak to what you've looked at and reviewed recently that could potentially impact the 2018 spend and if you see ways to improve on that going forward?","Thomas E. Jorden","As you know, we compile a lot of data and we look at that ratio carefully. As I said in my remarks, the percentage of our total capital, our drilling and completion cost is a really important metric. Not only have we seen our program be stronger if that ratio is high, but we've also seen some of our peers from time to time that have gotten into trouble, and carry it back to seeing that ratio get out of balance.","You have to make some of these other investments. Land investments are critical part of our projects. Certainly the midstream investments we're making, although we attempt to minimize them where we can, they do contribute to the profitability of our production base. And then we have to make saltwater disposal investments in order to also facilitate our production.","Now, would I love to see our drilling and completion dollars be 100% of our total capital? Yes, absolutely, because those are our most profitable investments and the other investments service those. But that's not feasible.","Now, we are looking at some things that we can explore to try to minimize that. We don't have anything specific we can talk about, but I will say this. We look at those ratios and our ratios for 2018 are really, really healthy. And I quoted a 13-year average. That's only because that's as far back as I have good accounting data to really compare that, that's going back to 2006, but we're in very good shape with our 2018 capital program as to how those profitable drilling and completion dollars are balanced against total capital.","Drew Venker","Excellent color, Tom. And then just on the spending philosophy and the capital plan, you guys raised money back in 2016 and you guys are still working on spending that in addition to cash flow. I'm thinking, beyond when you spend that cash balance, what do you think is the right spending philosophy relative to cash flow or otherwise longer-term, does it make sense to return cash to shareholders at some point as you kind of bear the fruit of all these investments, whether buybacks or dividends, or maybe is that too long a term to think about at this point?","Thomas E. Jorden","No, it's not too long-term at all. We've always said that we would like to maintain the balance sheet where our debt to cash flow is 1.5x or less, and we haven't changed our strives there. Now as we look ahead, I think in this commodity environment what we've been in the last few years, we will probably have a strong reluctance to not borrow. That's not a promise but I will say that we work very hard looking at our future and our bias is to live within cash flow or minimize our borrowings.","As far as returning cash to shareholders, we do pay dividend. I've talked at length that we cut that dividend in 2016. None of us felt particularly good about that, although that was the right decision at the time. And our Board, I will tell you I think is going to be looking at that and our bias is to recommend restoring that dividend to its high watermark as much as prudently possible. That will be a decision for the full Board but we'd like to see that dividend get back to its high watermark and then on a good growth trajectory.","I don't know that you can expect share buyback out of us. We are really achieving great returns on invested capital. I will tell you, as an owner of Cimarex, I'd rather have Cimarex invest the returns that we are achieving rather than give the cash back, and I think many of our long-term owners feel the same, that not that share buybacks are off the table but we're going to have a bias to increase our dividend and just make sure that we're making good profitable investments with our remaining cash. Mark, you want to comment on that?","Mark Burford","No, I think you said it well, Tom.","Drew Venker","Thanks for the color, Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Dingmann from SunTrust. Please go ahead with your question.","Neil Dingmann","Tom or John, or even Joe, my question really addresses your production timing. Recognizing that you have the 2018 guidance out, nothing beyond, could you all talk about the type of impact on total production these large pads like the Animal Kingdom or Snowshoe will have? Really guys what I'm trying to get a sense of, if essentially the benefit of these large A+ type well pads will essentially be more in 2019 than 2018, obviously recognizing you don't have any sort of 2019 guidance out?","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe. By virtue of me just saying that we're going to be flat from basically Q4 through Q2, and then all of a sudden we talk about the fourth quarter oil growth and the year-over-year production growth, there is a strong ramp. This is going to give us a real nice accelerate into 2019. Surely no different than years past where we've had these program ramps. Other than from my standpoint, we have like seven of them now, and all of them are coming on at the same time.","So, as you really look to us getting more into development mode, I think this is going to kind of be the norm. We're going to have a number of projects where you got six to eight or god knows how many wells all coming on at once, and I think we're gone from the days where you've got this steady single well growth to program platform growth like we're seeing.","So, I'm kind of dancing around your question at 2019 because we really haven't modelled that in tremendous detail, but what I will tell you is that it's a very strong ramp going into the fourth quarter and it's not beginning in the fourth quarter or it's beginning in the third quarter. So, from a timing standpoint if it were to get delayed, it's not going to, the ones I hate are the ones that all come on around November\/December, and if you have any hiccup, it's pushing to the next year.","But you know what, this production thing, maybe to philosophize it a little bit like Tom just did, we're measured quarter to quarter and you're looking at quarter to quarter production. What we're looking at is net asset value growth and the returns that are being generated by those production ramps are what are key to us. And if they move out a month or move forward a month, it's not what we are focused on. We're focused on a return on invested capital.","Thomas E. Jorden","John, you comment, because I know you study this hard as far as the impact of these big projects and what should we do when we [split them up] [ph].","John Lambuth","No, I think as we look at our per unit drilling cost, absolutely the big projects make sense from our standpoint. I do want to add a little bit color and I want to be clear, it's not like we plan for these projects all to come home in the second half. There are some in this particular case mitigating circumstance. One is our Avalon pilot. Basically we ran into, we could start the completions and then we have to become very inefficient because we run into what we call the prairie chicken season and we'd have to then shut down there a period of time. Thus, we decided it's best to delay it after that. That pushed it back later in the year.","And then secondly, our Shelly pilot, we're doing a lot of science with that including surface micro-seismic, and so we've imposed a single frac crew on that particular pilot. Again, in normal operations we'd expect to have two frackers out there. That further delays it.","So there are some operational things that are also pushing it. I would expect that as we get more and more to these individual developments, I think you'll see it line out more than always being in backend loaded. It's just this particular year a couple of our more \u2013 we had a little bit longer delay than what they normally would.","Neil Dingmann","Great answer, guys, and I absolutely agree. Given the cost basis, this seems to make a lot of sense. Just one quick follow-up, John or Joe, any indication or just thoughts about, I know it's early, but around the Lone Rock area as far as indications or thoughts around spacing there?","John Lambuth","That's why we've drilled both the Shelly pilot and why we've gone ahead and moved to the next pilot I mentioned. We want to get that one in the ground too. We feel very good about eight wells. That's what we're testing. The additional pilot that we're going to start drilling here very soon is on the more eastern side, so it's the more liquid-rich side, so now we'll have nice book in pilots on either end of our Lone Rock position. I think with both of those outcomes in hand, we'll be in very good shape to move forward pretty confidently in terms of how we would build that acreage.","Joseph R. Albi","Yes, our team is confident to bet on the 10,000 foot long development projects that are just waiting to be [numbered] [ph].","John Lambuth","Yes, they are.","Neil Dingmann","Very good, guys. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from [indiscernible] from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Arun Jayaram","This is Arun Jayaram from JP Morgan. Couple of questions. I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about your Lea County program. It looks like 225 million of capital. Could you just highlight some of the projects in the Triste Draw and the Red Hills area in 2018?","John Lambuth","This is John. If you go to Slide 21 in our presentation, we highlight both where the Triste Draw is as well as the Hallertau. Really both of those are again spacing pilots to really get us further along in terms of what we think ultimately spacing will be both in the Upper Wolfcamp as well as in the Avalon.","Furthermore, in the Red Hills area itself, we were looking at that slide. Off to the east, you see the large acreage position, kind of what we call the Main Red Hills Park. That is where we have several long laterals that we are drilling, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, where we're just reconfirming our expectation of results with the frac design.","There are some outstanding wells that are drilled in close proximity to that acreage position. This is an area that we've been wanting to get to. It's an area that we've often said is HBP. So it's not something we need to drill the hole. But now we've decided to move quite a bit of capital in there because the returns look fantastic.","And so, we're very excited about getting back up in the Lea County. I think the one thing I want to point out is we're also expanding or delineating. We have a number of wells trying to push the boundaries of in terms of what we think is profitable Wolfcamp and Avalon drilling. I think that's going to again put us in a much better position going forward in the 2019 for further development in that area. But it's without a doubt, when I look at our overall drilling program, this area in particular generates some of the most top tier returns we have.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And just my follow-up gentlemen, your outlook highlights a lot of completions in the third quarter, I think over 50. Could you talk about kind of the organization's ability, Tom, to meet that number? And just wanted to follow up also, what are your key LFS supplies? Halliburton had highlighted this morning some delays on the sand side. I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about that, is that perhaps impacting your 1Q completion schedule. I think you did say, you're self-sourcing some sand, but wondered if you could highlight or talk about these two points.","Thomas E. Jorden","I'll just speak to that and then turn it over to Joe. We are very confident in our ability to execute those completions. We do sit and talk to our service suppliers and line out our program. We've had very good success working at these problems. I'm very, very confident that we're going to be able to handle these logistics. Joe, you want to talk about sand bottlenecks?","Joseph R. Albi","As far as the logistics, I mentioned that we plan well in advance with crews and what have you and we've probably increased our crews from three to five here in the next few months and we've already got the crews lined up with our providers. So I don't see any issues there. Our batteries are constructed in quick fashion along with the fracs and so forth to getting the wells online. Unless of course we have any issues fracking the wells or what have you, we see no delays there.","From what I understand about the sand build issue, the Permian right now is directly related to rail, which is directly related to weather. And we're seeing, from our guys' standpoint, it's kind of being a relative hiccup and the sand that we've already procured in advance of our upcoming operations should not be affected at all by that. If it were to continue, then we'd probably see a slight problem.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, as you said, we haven't heard what remarks Halliburton made this morning, but we've had a lot of conversations with them about the short-term hiccup and it's not giving us any material concern. But go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","I was just going to say, did that have any impact on your 1Q completion count? Sounds like the answer is no.","Thomas E. Jorden","No.","Arun Jayaram","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead with your question.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning and congratulations on the quarter and all these multicenter projects coming up. I wanted to ask you with regard to Slide 13, are you at liberty to say how many new locations have been created by the successful Western Culberson Upper Wolfcamp results, of if you prefer, can you talk about how many acres this might open up for further exploration?","John Lambuth","This is John. First off, we're very, very pleased with those drilling results on the western side of Culberson County. The deliverability from those wells is just incredible. And furthermore, the yield content has been quite frankly a little bit higher than even we anticipated. So, they are generating outstanding rate of return results. I think what that's done, that drilling has kind of given us greater confidence now that the vast majority of that Culberson position looks extremely profitable from a development go-forward basis for the Upper Wolfcamp.","Now, in terms of what this development look like across the breadth of all of that acreage, we recognize there's variations there, so no one-size-fits-all, but I can at least say with confidence that the minimum average number of wells in Upper Wolfcamp will be at least eight, if not more than that, across the breadth of all that acreage. Now in some places it will be even more and some maybe a little less, but certainly over the vast majority of that acreage, there will be at least eight wells per section on average developed there. That's kind of what the pilots are leading us to now.","I will point out, what will change that for us is we are currently testing additional shallower landing zones in the Upper Wolfcamp in Culberson. We have a number of wells now that we have landed, and what's called the X and Y sands which sit right above the very rich shale part of the Upper Wolfcamp. Up until recently, we've put all our wells in the shale itself, but now we've moved even higher, and as we continue to watch those results, if we get strong encouragement, then that alone may increase the number of wells we can do just in terms of adding another bench. That is something that we'll be monitoring through the year and certainly adjusting our plans if those results are encouraging.","Thomas E. Jorden","So, we didn't answer your question. We don't publish well counts but that whole area between the Upper and Lower Wolfcamp is just amazingly prolific. John talked about spacing the Upper Wolfcamp, our Animal Kingdom test 14 wells in the Lower Wolfcamp. Those are independent zones. We can develop one and come in years later and develop the other, and there's not a concern about [fairness] [ph]. So, it's just an absolutely wonderful arena and we can drill 2-mile laterals at will. There's discussion about even testing a 3-mile lateral there. So, we'll be working out here for decades to come.","Jeffrey Campbell","Actually I appreciate your answer a lot. I thought there was plenty of good color there. I just want to make sure I understood the last part that John was talking about. Are you saying that you're testing the XY in Culberson?","John Lambuth","Yes.","Jeffrey Campbell","A lot of the XY testing that I've seen has been further the east.","John Lambuth","Yes, it has. And we have, per experience of our other drilling in other parts of the basin as well as other operators, we are very intrigued with that section. Thus, we have moved up into it with a number of tests and hopefully in the coming releases I'll be able to talk about those wells. So, we'll see.","Jeffrey Campbell","Yes, we'll look forward to those results. If I could just as a follow-up ask a broader question, when I look at a slide like Slide 28 for the Shelly spacing test and you've talked about that in response to an earlier question, I'm just trying to understand, are these and of course other tests elsewhere, are these sort of iterative exercises in highly similar geology or does an eight-well test in one place and a 12-well test in another already illustrate a view that some of the acreage is more likely to support additional wells versus other acreage?","John Lambuth","This is John. First off, obviously we've done a lot of drilling development in the Woodford Shale, and so I think we have a pretty good understanding in terms of, for instance like our latest Clyde Copeland results, we learned a lot from that in terms of what ultimate spacing might be. But the reason you might look at a Shelly and ask yourself, why they are doing 8 and 12, testing both in one pilot, it's simply as we move to the south, we are dealing with a little bit different thickness, a little bit different in terms of pressure regime, and even a little bit different in terms of hydrocarbon content.","So, as much as we're confident in what that spacing will look like, we still need to test kind of some of the [in-member] [ph] balance of it, then we have greater confidence when we do go full development on the acreage. So that's why you go out with a Shelly type pilot, just to kind of reconfirm our expectation for the rest of that Lone Rock acreage.","Thomas E. Jorden","We had a lot of debate on this. We wanted to try a little tighter spacing because of our really interesting results in our Clyde Copeland test. Our Clyde Copeland test was testing 16 and 20 wells per section, little thicker part of the Woodford, and we also discovered in our Clyde Copeland test a really meaningful result when we stack\/staggered for the low Chevron pattern in our wells.","So, it was really based on that result that we wanted to just go a little bit tighter in Shelly, but it's not thick enough there to do the stack\/stagger, so we kind of just said, we'll just try a little tighter, we'll do 8 and 12. We call these things pilots. They are really development projects. We're just going to try some things along the way and continue to learn.","John Lambuth","If I could real quick, if you look at Slide 27 in fact, we show the updated Clyde Copeland results and you will now see that indeed the 20 well spacing wells are even starting to separate themselves over time, and again, that's that learning of staggering within that thick Woodford Shale. That was a very important learning for us and something we're going to incorporate in future development projects in the Woodford where we have sufficient thickness to do that.","Jeffrey Campbell","Right. This is really great color. I guess what I'm getting from this is, this project really is unique and that goes in line with what you just said that these are really development projects. And also, if I can just add as a follow-up, you mentioned that you're doing some science in Shelly and it sounds like the reason for doing that is because there is actually several different variables that you're trying to test. Is that the way to think of it?","John Lambuth","Yes, you can think of it that way. One of the biggest outcomes that also came from Clyde Copeland is, we did deploy what we call surface micro-seismic, and we learned a lot from that in terms of our efficacy of our frac design, the interaction between individual wells and a development like that, and we felt it was crucial that we deploy the same type of science with that first pilot down at Lone Rock.","We really think that getting that done now early, we're going to learn a lot about how best to for example the cadence of which wells to complete first within a major developed section, we are zipper-fracking but then there's things we look at in terms of the staggering of where we are in the bore hole. There's a lot we've learned by having that science out there, and as I mentioned, we've decided to get the best benefit out of that pilot, we'll do that which is one frac crew.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, great. Thanks. I appreciate. Always learn something on these calls, that's why I look forward to them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Portillo from TPH. Please go ahead with your question.","Matthew Portillo","Just a quick follow-up question in regards to service cost inflation. Are you currently baking in benefit from the acceleration of use on zipper fracs and then sourcing of regional sand, or does that potentially help mitigate some of the cost inflation as you move into 2018?","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe. I'll take a stab at that. To the extent, and John can jump in to the greater percentages that we'll come at on wells, in particular in the Wolfcamp we'll grow our first well and build a battery that is not only going to accommodate the first well but plan for up to seven additional wells on that battery.","So when I quote a Wolfcamp cost range, you could assume that the first well is probably going to be on the upper end of that range and the additional add-on wells would be on the lower end of that range. The economies of scale that you see there are reduced battery cost and then those add-on wells you are usually growing multiple number of wells, so that's where you can see some cost gains or cost benefits, excuse me, associated with zipper fracking and water sourcing. So, yes, to the extent that the inventory of wells that we have in our budget are add-on wells, they are going to reflect those costs, and if it's a first well, it's going to reflect the other cost.","The sand sourcing part of your question, no, the benefits from sand sourcing are not in the equation yet. We think we're right around the corner from having some in place there that could have sizable cost benefits to us.","John Lambuth","I'll follow-up with Joe. The only thing I would add is, what we're representing new, as Joe said, our go forward expectation for this possibility today. I mean we crude up [indiscernible] as best we can to represent what we think we'll be spending per well. But I will tell you, in terms of some of these plays, Meramec in particular, we are looking long and hard at our current frac design and looking at in fact some of our offset operators and asking ourselves could we perhaps get similar results with maybe a change, a systematic change in design, it may actually save a little bit on the cost side.","I think we're at that part in the Meramec where, and let me be clear, we're extremely pleased with our Meramec program over the course of the latter half of 2017, now we're at that point we're saying, okay, are there some tweaks we can make to the design that may pull back the cost a little and still get still superior returns, and that's something that we're discussing right now internally.","Joseph R. Albi","Are increased costs baked into our capital budget plan? The answer is, yes. And it's reflected, you can do simple math and just look at the cost increases that I quoted for the Meramec program as well as the Wolfcamp program and do some back of the envelope calculations to see that those represent a fair portion of the capital budget this year. With sand sourcing, through the efficiencies John is talking about, it's our intention to get those costs down and keep our productivity where it is.","Matthew Portillo","Great. And then as my follow-up just a quick two-part question I think for John. One, we noticed that you guys are adding some incremental activity to Ward County in 2018 and I was wondering if you could provide any color on results from last year and how you're thinking about that asset moving forward? And then two, just a quick follow-up on the XY, obviously a new target that you're testing, do you already have results in hand and do you have any thoughts around just the liquids yields on that asset in Culberson?","John Lambuth","In regards your second question, I'm not going to really comment on that because it's still early on the flowback of the wells, so we'll just have to wait and see. As to the first part in Ward, we do have two wells on production now and we are learning a lot from that. There are a couple of comments I'll make.","There is always a concern on our part that with that existing layer of Third Bone wells, how would new wells interact with that. I think we're getting more confident now that we can land in that upper part of the Wolfcamp and achieve pretty good results and not have a detrimental effect on those Third Bone Spring wells, that's been a good outcome.","We're getting better at understanding one of the things in Ward is \u2013 one of the things I look at is just water cut that's a huge component to the returns. I think we're getting a better handle on our expectation there. And then quite frankly the thing that's helping us there are a lot of competitor wells that have come on recently, some outstanding wells that are quite frankly very close to our existing position.","So we're very excited to go out there and test some of those Upper Wolfcamp landing zones nearby some recent competitor wells that look pretty attractive to us. So we have a number of, I think it's around four or five wells that I think we'll be drilling this year in Ward, scattered throughout the year as we continue to test across our acreage.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.","David Deckelbaum","Tom, I wanted to ask because you highlighted the progress you made in 2017, how you think about creating value for shareholders as you look into 2018 with more of these larger projects? You highlighted in the release I think a lot of, you've talked about in the past, retaining efficiency gains. With the move to larger pads and a greater contribution in the Permian, do you still see the efficiency gains holding on sort of a per well basis or cycle time as relative to 2017, are you factoring in perhaps some expanded cycle times on a sort of per well basis as you kind of go to more of these large projects?","Thomas E. Jorden","There's a lot in your question, David. When it comes to efficiency, a course \u2013 we quickly want to bring that conversation to rate of return. These large pads we think generate superior rates of return. We think long laterals and our pad development gives us some efficiencies or facilities to generate outstanding returns. But there is the timing delay and we study that hard as to do we want to do these big projects or do we want to split it up into smaller projects and get the production on faster.","There are a lot of elements to that problem, one of which is well-to-well interference. So, you really have to understand what happens to the boundaries of that project if you split it up into smaller pieces. But we're fairly confident that our program as crafted is generating great returns. That's our lands. I mean I'm a broken record here, but production is interesting but full-cycle returns, modeling in production delays, modeling in the capital lag between first investment and first production, that's all baked in when we look at our returns and we're very confident that the program as designed is generating our optimum returns. You want to comment on that, John?","John Lambuth","No, I absolutely agree. I think we have put a lot of effort, as Tom alluded, to making sure that some of these developments aren't too big. I mean that is one lesson we learned from our Woodford development where we get out there and do six contiguous sections of development. The time lag is not something we like, and it exposes you in a way over the course of a year plus. So, we've worked hard.","For instance, most of these developments in the Upper Wolfcamp that we're talking about, in Culberson and Reeves, typically are half section size is what we're doing. You're thinking six to eight wells each of them. And so, we've made that adjustment.","Again, I would like to think especially \u2013 I'm not making any comment on 2019 here, but as we get to more and more of those types of developments and that becomes a regular part of our routine, I don't think you're going to see this type of lumpiness or end of the year. I think there are some other mitigating factors, as I alluded to earlier, that has pushed more of the production to later in this year because of some of the things I talked about. I think on a go forward basis, I think the cadence would be you'll see more of a normal production increase off of these individual projects we do as we do more and more of them.","Thomas E. Jorden","But you know, David, I really salute your question because we debate this constantly internally, and let me give you a very quick example. Where we know we're going to have larger development on the section, particularly in the Delaware basin, we'll go ahead and pre-build the facility, the flowback facility, to accommodate more wells. We may initially have one or two wells coming in but we'll go ahead and build the facility to be ready to accommodate additional six or so additional wells.","And we're asking ourselves, is that the prudent thing? I mean our first pass on that was, so yes, that's a smart thing because you know you're going to come back in. But I will tell you, our operating group, rightly because I said at the outset, our rate of return discussion permeates our culture, and they are asking that question as maybe that's not the right approach, maybe smaller facilities that we build will be needed as a better investment of capital. So, these are great questions and I think any good operator ought to constantly be debating this internally, as we do.","David Deckelbaum","Sorry to throw in such a loaded one towards the end of the call.","Thomas E. Jorden","We didn't even bring in the midstream. You don't want to give us an opportunity to talk there.","David Deckelbaum","My only follow-up, I guess something lighter, on the Woolfolk\/NIB, you commented I think in your prepared remarks, John, that you're changing your cadence of completion as enhanced results. Can you just give a little bit more color on what you were describing there?","John Lambuth","Sure. I think the biggest difference there is we recognize \u2013 there is a big difference, and when you talk about a Woodford Shale relative to a Meramec which is more of a silty interval and how they frac, and what we've learned is when you're in that type of development where you have both Woodford and Meramec opportunity, in particular you want to frac the Woodford well first. It needs to go first, it needs the chance to have every chance to break that rock. And then you can follow-up with the Meramec, and that was really one of the things we were testing, as we have with a couple of other tests, and that seems to be leading to very good results for both the Woodford and the Meramec wells. So we're very pleased with that outcome. That really is shining a light on that 14-10 area where we're looking at it as a major future development area for us in the coming years, and as well there are just some really outstanding results for us.","Thomas E. Jorden","And also we're plugging here for our science, because we had a lot of history out here and our conventional wisdom and our experience led us to exactly the opposite conclusion. And it was because of some science we were collecting on micro-seismic data and some really heads-up curious behavior on a couple of our geo-scientists that they noticed the phenomenon that at first we looked at and we thought, could that be right, because it was absolutely not what we expected, it led us to do some further testing and it is a lifetime success in understanding of the right way to develop these reservoirs.","John Lambuth","And it's absolutely critical for us, I want to emphasize this that the 14-10 area in particular is unique in that you have wonderful thickness in the Meramec that we are absolutely convinced at a minimum you get two benches to develop, but you also still have sufficient thickness in Woodford to generate superior, very good return. So, it's one of the few areas across that whole STACK play where you have thickness in both that leads to that co-development and we're very excited about that for future drilling opportunity for us.","David Deckelbaum","Thanks for the comments, guys, and your responses.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","John Nelson","Congrats on the quarter and thanks for squeezing me in here. Just more couple of housekeeping type questions. There were I guess a bit more cryptic comments on oilfield service cost inflation and kind of how we can back into it. I guess if I look at the well costs that you guys have up year-on-year, it's in that kind of 10% range. So is that kind of what you're saying is baked into, just flat from here is kind of what's baked into the 2018 guidance or can we get a little bit more color on that?","John Lambuth","This is John. From a simple standpoint, if we've bumped up our midpoints for the Meramec program and the Wolfcamp program by 10%, if you just take the number of wells that we're quoting for each of those programs, you'll get to a number. We really didn't kind of look at the budget and say, okay, what do we want to bake in for inflation and then put a top level adjustment in there. We looked at what we thought the actual cost ranges were based on the frac designs for each one of these type wells and we're kind of brushing over the complexities of the total well cost associated with frac design, build for one, plan for four, build for one, plan for eight, and all the other implications that Mark and I looked at the back of the envelope calculations yesterday and thought maybe it's somewhere around $75 million to $80 million, if you look at what it represented as compared to what we would have done three or four months ago.","Joseph R. Albi","The only other comment I'll add to that is I will tell you in particular for Anadarko where a pretty large portion of our budget is outside operated wells. We took a really hard look at 2017 in terms of the wells we participated in and they are very good return wells. We felt like we made good decisions but we also felt like that we needed to adjust that capital higher relative to what we were represented as being the expected costs. Clearly, those wells were coming at much higher, so we have adjusted in 2018 an expectation of higher capital for those individual outside operated wells.","Thomas E. Jorden","So, John, we took our best guess at it and certainly we're not perfect at anticipating, and Joe mentioned this local sand sourcing in Delaware, when it comes online will I think be a big help here. And then our range, I will say the high end of our range kind of anticipates a little bit of inflation. So, if we didn't see any inflation, we'd probably be at the lower end of that, just checking from here on out. So, we took our best guess.","John Lambuth","One other comment I'd like to make too is if you look at the midpoint for the 1-mile Woodford AFE that I quoted in the call, it's barely up at all, and even with the same inflationary pressures on service cost and proppant and basically every cost category associated with completions, while we changed our frac design. And so, especially in Meramec, I think there's tremendous potential to keep experimenting there and we can see cost reductions there. The sand sourcing can have a significant impact in the Delaware. And so, obviously our goal is to get those numbers down, but those are where current AFEs are and that's what's in our current capital plan.","John Nelson","That's really helpful. So, just to be clear, it's expectations of kind of flat from here is probably around the midpoint of your range and then a cushion for insulation is kind of the high end of the range?","Mark Burford","Correct, John, yes, so kind of the low end of the range is kind of expectation that we currently see some inflation already built in and the upper end of the range could allow for some additional inflation if we experience it, which we hope to offset with some of the operational changes we'll make with local sourcing and other maybe frac design changes. But that's right, just amongst the uncertainty of what that range could be into the future, but we have some room in our range.","John Nelson","Great. And then I just wondered if you can comment kind of ballpark the amount that was spent in Lea County in 2017? Seems like a pretty significant pickup and you had some of the best rock there as we've seen.","Thomas E. Jorden","We don't have that in front of us. Mark is searching for it. It is a huge pickup because as we've said in past calls, our Delaware Basin [indiscernible] a bit on Lea County and we wanted them to understand some of the multi-pay development. They have made tremendous progress on [indiscernible] this year.","John Lambuth","Yes, there was a lot of drilling activity in the latter half of 2017.","Joseph R. Albi","About 70 million.","John Lambuth","Yes, but we haven't really \u2013 now we're getting to where we're completing those wells. So, we'll bear that fruit this year from the drilling activity that we embarked on at the end of 2017 in Lea County.","Thomas E. Jorden","Did you hear that, John, it was about 70 million for basically [indiscernible] our effort this year.","John Nelson","That's great. All right, thanks again. Congrats on the quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question. This question comes from Joe Allman from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","Joseph Allman","Tom, a question on free cash flow, so how much is being free cash flow positive a factor in the capital decision-making or do you really see it as an output? So, in other words, if you have the right assets and you do the right things and you have reasonable commodity prices, over time you're naturally going to spend that cash flow, partly because you build upper base at relatively low decline in production. So what I'm getting at, I'm just trying to figure out what kind of iterations you ran when you thought about 2018 spending and what are the governors, balance sheet, production growth, I mean what are some of the governors you consider?","Thomas E. Jorden","Thank you for that question, Joe. We do treat free cash flow as an outplay. We think that a company that has good investments, high rate of return, good operational execution, ought to be living within cash flow and generating certainly some growth. I mean it will depend on company to company. But our greatest concern is in our balance sheet metrics. You know, free cash flow, that's certainly become kind of the mantra. I will tell you, at Cimarex we look at our debt, we look at our debt-to-EBITDA, we look at our coverage statistics, and we want to be growing those over time, and we want to be over time growing our financial health.","When we look to 2018, we had such a strong year in 2017, we looked at that cash on the balance sheet and said, why would we have that cash sitting there, and all the choices were available to us. I want to be totally clear and transparent here. We could have embarked on some modest share buyback, we could have returned that cash to the shareholders, or we could have invested it.","That's why I said at the outset that when we looked at that, we said, look, this is a very challenging commodity environment, so we better make sure that our actual to expected results are really well calibrated, and we tore our 2017 results apart and we saw that we had tremendous repeatability, in fact we went back to 2016 and 2017 and we saw that we had great repeatability that gave us a high degree of confidence that we could hit what we aim for. And so, we said we're going to invest that cash.","When we reported our capital plan, we reported with a plan that we would invest that cash over a couple of years, 2018 being one, and that was what went into it. Our bias is to invest that cash. We raise that money with that promise and that promise is still something we want to honor. So, that's kind of how we look at the world, Joe.","Joseph Allman","I appreciate, Tom. And just a quick follow-up, so you've always been about executing and focusing on rates of return and NPV and growing shareholder value. Your stock is not necessarily reflecting your successful execution. So, are you thinking about doing any different, sort of close any gap that exists between what is your Company's worth and where the stock is trading?","Thomas E. Jorden","We try not to pay too much attention on an hourly basis toward share price, but you can't ignore it either. I think there's some confusion out there about Cimarex. We have assets second to none, we have an organization second to none, but we are trapped in an environment where people are really questioning the basic value of the energy space and people are looking for things to worry about, and Cimarex has a foot in a couple of the camps people are looking to worry about.","We didn't get asked today about gas price differentials. We certainly are exposed to that. But we model all of that in, and as I said at the outset, gas is only 18% of our revenue right now. So, we think we are in a pretty good shape there and we see some light at the end of the tunnel.","I can't sit here and talk to the investment community about what they should value. I'm obviously extremely high on Cimarex and I think our track record speaks for itself. I'll tell you what we value. How we approach, how we think we can invest and add value over time, we've got a good track record, and I welcome that conversation.","So, from time to time there will be disconnects. Right now there's this mantra around free cash flow, and I think in some sense anybody that deviates from the herd is going to be punished in the short run, but if we have a strategy that's well-crafted and we execute it well, it will get figured out in the long run.","Joseph Allman","Got it, great, very helpful. Thank you, Tom.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call back over to Tom Jorden, President and CEO of Cimarex, for any closing remarks.","Thomas E. Jorden","I want to thank everybody for your participation and I know these are challenging times. We are looking forward to a strong 2018, and I'll just say in closing that we're a very result-oriented company, we focus completely on results, and we expect you to measure us based on our results. We appreciate our fans and we appreciate our critics, and I mean that most sincerely.","This whole conversation about value creation is a great one. We debate these things at Cimarex. I look forward as the year goes on to discuss some of the learnings from our look-back more thoroughly. We are debating changing our approach and some of the ways we measure ourselves. So, I just really want to tell you, we love this business, we love getting up every day and being challenged to be better at it, and that's our mission at Cimarex. So, thank you very much for everything you bring to us.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, with that we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."],"5571":["Cimarex Energy Co. (NYSE:XEC) Q4 2016 Earnings Call February 16, 2017 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thomas E.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Karen Acierno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Cimarex fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. In addition to earnings, in a separate release yesterday afternoon, we put out our 2017 capital plans and production and expense guidance for the year. An updated presentation was also posted to our website yesterday afternoon. We will be referring to this presentation during our call today.","As a reminder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business.","Prepared remarks will begin with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden; followed by an update on our drilling activities and results from John Lambuth, Senior VP of Exploration; and then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on our operations, including production and well costs. Cimarex's CFO, Mark Burford, is also present to help answer any questions.","So that we can accommodate more of your questions during the hour we have allotted for the call, we'd like to ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. And then of course feel free to get back in the queue if you like.","So with that, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you, Karen, and thanks to everyone who is participating in today's conference. As always, we sincerely appreciate your interest and look forward to your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. On the call today, John will give a rundown of our recent results and some of the delineation that we have underway in 2017. Joe will provide an operational overview, including the tremendous progress we're making on field optimization.","I'd like to kick off the call with some overview remarks on our 2016 results, as well as our outlook for 2017 and beyond.","Cimarex had a very good year in 2016. It was to say the least an interesting year. It's hard to believe that NYMEX oil prices one year ago today closed at $29 per barrel. We had three stated goals for 2016; preserve our assets, preserve our organization, and preserve our balance sheet. Today, Cimarex stands in the best position we have ever been in. Our cash flow is strong and improving, our assets are delivering outstanding results and plentiful future opportunity, and our organization is intact and forging ahead.","Our investment program generated historically good returns in 2016. As we look to the future, we see a landscape in which Cimarex is able to sustainably live within cash flow, generate top-tier returns and consistently grow at a healthy rate.","Now as always, our focus is on capital efficiency and full cycle return on investment. When faced with the choice between superior returns and quick production hits, we will opt for the superior investment returns always.","In 2016, Cimarex added reserves have replaced 128% of the company's production. Although, our total proved reserves remained relatively flat from year-end 2015 levels, a quick look under the hood explains this. Proved developed reserves increased 5% year-over-year, and our PUD volumes decreased 17%. We ended 2016 with 21% PUDs, down from 25% PUDs at year-end 2015. Although the complexion and nature of our undeveloped assets did not change, we chose to adopt a less aggressive stance on PUDs due to the difficulties of managing around the SEC five-year development rule for PUD reserves.","On the financial front, the fourth quarter was the first quarter in two years with both GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted earnings for the quarter. This was a reflection of the increase in commodity prices and our first quarter in seven quarters without a ceiling test write-down. Production was 960 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the fourth quarter and 963 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the full year, which was within our guidance.","Production was down 2% year-over-year, which was a natural consequence of the decrease in drilling activity. As I said a moment ago, we enter 2017 with renewed optimism and confidence that should oil remain in the $40 to $60 per barrel range, Cimarex will consistently generate attractive returns and solid growth. In 2017, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to grow our overall company production 13%, which will be led by a 25% increase in oil volumes.","Furthermore, we project our Q4 2017 oil volumes to increase 30% to 35% over Q4 2016 oil volumes. The capital program we announced yesterday will have significant carryover into 2018 and provide a springboard into 2018 and beyond.","We made significant progress on several technical fronts in 2016. In the Delaware Basin, our Sunny's Halo and Gato del Sol pilots performed remarkably well. They confirmed eight wells per section in the Wolfcamp A zone of Culberson County. We have a follow-on test underway that will test even tighter well spacing. In the Anadarko Basin, we had encouraging results from Woodford spacing as tight as 12 wells per section and we're underway testing tighter well spacing.","We continued our rapid fire pace of completion innovations, delivering better and better wells and a deeper understanding of the downhole processes that govern our stimulations. As with almost all innovation, the trajectory is not always upward. Our teams are hard at work tearing into some of the mysteries and remaining challenges.","John will provide detail on some of these important pilots and individual wells in his remarks, and will give you a flavor of how our capital will be invested in 2017. 2017 exploration and development capital is estimated to be between $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, up 56% from 2016 levels. Of that, about 76% or $850 million to $900 million will be spent drilling and completing wells. This drilling and completion capital tilts toward the Delaware Basin, with 66% of our total drilling and completion capital earmarked for the Delaware. At strip prices, this capital program is funded with cash flow from operations. We have cash on the balance sheet to fill in the gaps or to expand our program further should we decide.","We continue to emphasize our core strengths of idea generation and innovation. In 2017, the challenge to our organization is to do it again.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide further color on our program.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our upcoming 2017 plans.","During the fourth quarter, Cimarex invested $246 million on exploration and development, bringing the total to $735 million for the year. About 59% of our 2016 capital was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going to our activities in the Mid-Continent region. Companywide, we brought 55 gross, 25 net wells on production during the fourth quarter, bringing the total to 153 gross, 61 net wells for the year.","We increased our operated rig count from five in the third quarter to 11 currently running. These rigs are busy working to hold acreage in both the Wolfcamp and Meramec as well as drilling multi-well pads to further test spacing the completions in both regions. Three of the 11 are currently drilling an increased density spacing, down spacing pilot in the Woodford. I'll go into more detail on that later.","Permian region is first up regarding drilling results, where we have initial results to share with you on our spacing pilot in the Upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County. This pilot located on the Sunny's Halo, Gato del Sol sections was drilled using 7,500-foot laterals that were completed using our most recent updated frac design.","Slide 17 in our investor presentation gives a summary of the results to-date. As can be seen on the average cumulative production versus days plot, we see very similar results for both the six and eight-well per section spacing pilots. Given this outcome, it is now our plan to test equivalent of 12 wells per section with six new wells spudding in the first quarter of 2017.","Earlier this year, we completed the Upper Wolfcamp Kingman 45 State Unit 2H which is located on the Western half of our Culberson acreage. We have now completed another Upper Wolfcamp well in this area, the 10,000-foot Lord Murphy 10 State A 2H well, which had a peak 30-day IP average of 2,207 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 60% was oil. The location of this latest Upper Wolfcamp well can be seen on slide 13. We have plans to drill more Upper Wolfcamp wells in this area of Culberson during 2017.","Completion operations were recently finished with early flow back underway on an Upper Wolfcamp well located on our Eddy County White City acreage, which depending upon results, could open up even more acreage for development in this zone.","Now, on to the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford development project on the east side of the Cana core in the fourth quarter of 2015. This development covers six sections of which Cimarex operates the two westernmost sections. Completion of the wells began in mid-September with all of the Cimarex operated wells now completed and on production. Our partner continues to complete their wells with an expectation that all of these wells will be on production during the second quarter of 2017.","We also completed the Leon Gundy wells, our stacked\/staggered Meramec-Woodford spacing pilot. These wells were brought on production in October, and we continue to monitor the flow back very carefully. We look forward to discussing results of this pilot in more detail on our next earnings call.","Now, I'd like to spend a little time talking about our plans for 2017. Yesterday, we announced an exploration and development budget of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, of which $850 million to $900 million is earmarked for drilling and completing wells. We have a number of exciting projects to pursue in 2017.","First, in the Permian region, where we plan to spend two-thirds of our drilling and completion capital in 2017. We entered the year with five rigs in the Permian with plans to add three more by April. The majority of this capital, around $294 million, will be spent on Wolfcamp long lateral wells in Reeves and Culberson County. Some of this drilling will be for new pilots, such as the aforementioned Upper Wolfcamp spacing pilot in Culberson County, as well as an Upper Wolfcamp pilot in Reeves County, which is testing 16 wells per section and a four-well test on what we call the Pagoda section.","We also plan to spend capital, around $109 million, drilling Avalon and Wolfcamp wells on our acreage located in Eddy and Lea County, New Mexico. Included in this capital are a couple of increased density pilots in the Avalon that will test the equivalent of 12 and 20 wells per section.","As a reminder, we have seen no degradation in well performance with our most recent eight-well per section Avalon pilots. A vast majority of the remaining Permian budget, around $116 million, will go to drilling Bone Spring wells in Texas and New Mexico.","We expect to spend about 1\/3 of our drilling and completion capital in the Mid-Continent in 2017. This includes about $120 million for drilling Meramec wells to further delineate and hold acreage. This capital, which is comprised mostly of three-rig lines, will HBP the vast majority of our Meramec acreage by the end of 2017.","Initial drilling in the Woodford will be an eight-well increased density pilot that is testing both 16 and 20 Woodford wells per section, as diagramed on slide 25 of the presentation. We intend to use our learnings from this pilot to determine spacing as we move forward on the next big Woodford infill, which is scheduled to begin drilling in the fourth quarter.","See the map on page 24 for the location of the Leota\u2010Jacobs project, which is tentatively planned to cover 13 sections and will be co-developed with our partner. We currently operate six rigs in Anadarko region with plans to add four more in the fourth quarter. As is becoming more and more the case, timing is everything when it comes to the drilling, completion and ultimately the production and cash flow from these multi-well projects.","Slide 10 illustrates the timing of completions in 2017, which are pretty evenly distributed throughout the year, but the number of wells expected to be drilling or waiting on completion at year-end 2017, as shown in the bar to the far right, illustrates the momentum we expect going into 2018.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll recap our fourth quarter production results, discuss our 2017 production outlook, and then finish up with a few comments as usual on LOE and service costs. Our fourth quarter net equivalent production came in about as expected with our reported volume of 960 million a day, up 1.4% from our Q3 reported average of 947 million a day, and as Tom mentioned, within our guidance range of 945 million a day to 985 million a day.","As we projected in our last call, our late Q3 and Q4 completion activity ramped up total company production from our Q3 average of 947 million a day to a December posting of over 1 Bcf equivalent per day. Our fourth quarter net equivalent Permian volume came in at 511.5 million a day, that's down 1% from Q3 2016. But our Q4 Permian oil volumes of 36,253 barrels a day were up 1% from Q3. We brought on 11 gross and eight net Permian wells in the fourth quarter. Five of the eight net wells were in Reeves County in our Upper Wolfcamp play, including the 100% Wood State five, six and seven wells.","Our fourth quarter Permian volumes were negatively impacted by approximately 5 million a day as a result of operational issues on our Wood State two, three and four pad. Fishing operations to retrieve stuck coil tubing in the number two well prevented us from bringing the pad on during the fourth quarter. After temporarily suspending fishing operations on the number two well, we initiated production from the three wells in early Q1, with plans to get back on to the number two well and continue fishing operations after our flowing pressures have declined.","Our Q4 Mid-Continent net equivalent volume came in at 446 million a day, that's up 4% over our third quarter average of 427 million a day. Q4 higher yield East Cana infill development activity bumped our Mid-Continent oil volume up to 9,205 barrels a day, that's an 8% increase over Q3 2016 and in aggregate it's really driven by the 44 gross and 17 net Mid-Continent wells that we brought on during the quarter.","Looking at 2017, we've extensively reworked the preliminary nine-rig production plan that we provided you in the last call. Under current model, we're adding rigs through Q2 and Q4, as John mentioned, we're incorporating tighter spacing projects in both regions, and really shifting our areas of focus. And as a result, our revised model projects total company 2017 net equivalent production average 1.06 Bcfe to 1.11 Bcfe per day with the midpoint increase of 13% over 2016.","We've directed more capital to Permian and our higher liquid project areas in the Mid-Continent with a focus on oil. And as a result, we're projecting significant oil growth in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent areas, but forecasted total company year-over-year oil production growth in the range of 22% to 27%.","Our projected capital and completion activity is skewed 2\/3 to the Permian, 1\/3 to the Mid-Continent. We anticipate bringing 60 net Permian wells, and 37 net Mid-Continent wells on production during the year, that's up respectively from the 30 and 31 net wells we completed in the two areas in 2016.","We're forecasting a ramp in our rigs beginning in Q2, as John mentioned, from a current total of 11 to a total of 18 by the end of the year with 10 working in the Mid-Continent, and eight in the Permian. And as a result, we're modeling both capital and completion activity to really accelerate in the Q2 and Q3 timeframes.","With that, we're projecting a strong Q4 2017 exit rate in the neighborhood of 1.11 Bcfe per day to 1.17 Bcfe per day, that's a 16% to 22% increase over where we were in Q4 2016, and we'll have approximately 47 net wells either drilling or waiting on completion at the end of the year. That well inventory and the nice exit rate we believe are going to give us some very nice tailwind as we head into 2018.","For Q1, our revised model projects total company net equivalent production to be in the range of 1.01 Bcfe per day to 1.05 Bcfe per day, that's up 5% to 9% from our Q4 2016 average and 4% to 8% from where we were a year ago in Q1 2016.","Jumping over to operating expense, we posted another great quarter with our LOE. Our Q4 lifting cost came in at $0.58 per Mcfe, that's down 5% from our Q3 2016 average of $0.61 per Mcfe and it beat our guidance of $0.60 per Mcfe to $0.70 per Mcfe. With that, our full year lifting cost came in at $0.66 per Mcfe, that's down 20% from the $0.83 per Mcfe that we posted in 2015, and 39% from the dollar rate we reported in 2014.","Our production group has worked extremely hard over the last two years to reduce and control our operating cost structure, get it to the levels that they're now and they're dedicated to continuing their efforts to keep the cost in check as we move forward. After we've incorporated our current operating cost structure, the fluctuating nature of our workover expenses and our 2017 drilling focus on liquid rich projects, we're projecting our 2017 lifting cost to be in the range of $0.60 per Mcfe to $0.70 per Mcfe.","And finally, a few comments on drilling and completion costs. With the exception of a slight increase in the cost of tubulars, we continue to see drilling cost components remain relatively in check. That said, we've begun to see upward pressure on our completion costs, primarily in the service costs to pump our frac operations, but also in the cost for wireline operations and 100 mesh sand, where we've seen just slight increases as well.","In general, the cost components for our completion operations really hit a low for us in Q3 2016 and are currently at levels that we saw in the Q1 2016, Q2 2016 time periods. As a result and depending on the program in frac design as is always the case, we've seen our go-forward completion at these increased 4% to 15% from our Q4 2016 levels. With that, we continue to focus on efficiencies on the drilling side by reducing our days to rig release. In Cana, as an example, our days to TD in 2015 were at 30 days. We've got that number down to 24 days in 2016 and on the completion side by optimizing completion design, water sourcing and pumping operations.","As a result of our efficiency gains, our current total well cost AFEs have not changed dramatically from the estimate that we provided to you last quarter. In the Permian, we've raised the upper end of our current Bone Spring 1-mile lateral AFE with a range $4.7 million to $5.5 million. Likewise, in the Wolfcamp, we've also raised the upper cost stand of our large completion 2-mile lateral Culberson Wolfcamp AFE with a range of $10.2 million to $11.4 million. That's down 4% from the $10.8 million to $11.6 million that we saw in Q4 2015.","In Cana, our current drilling AFEs are down 9% to 10% with lower day rates resulting from our long-term rig contract rolling off, which helped to offset the 15% completion cost increase we've seen on our larger fracs. And with us hitting the low end of our previous cost guidance before the completion cost increases, we've opted to keep our 1-mile lateral Woodford total well cost estimate in the range of $7.1 million to $7.5 million, that's still down from late 2014 by 10%. And similar to our Woodford AFEs as we continue to experiment with frac design, we're still quoting our current 2-mile lateral Meramec AFEs in the range of $10.5 million to $12 million, again with frac design being the largest cost variable in the total well cost.","So in closing, with a ramp in production in Q4 2016, we're off to a great start here in 2017. We've stepped up our activity, put together a diversified 2017 drilling program that's focused on oil. We're projecting a nice ramp in production to springboard us into 2018. Our cost structure remains healthy and strong and our overall program continues to generate positive results. We're very excited about 2017.","So with that, we'll turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, guys. Tom, for you or the guys, was wondering how \u2013 I'm looking at specifically slide 20 where you outline your Mid-Continent overview and you talk about sort of the Meramec play outline and the Woodford play outline. Two questions there. You have a bit of acreage that we've heard a lot of chatter recently on the northwest part up in Blaine, Dewey \u2013 might be outside of that. And just wondering what you thought about acreage a little bit further northwest, and how that compares to where you've got sort of the deem, (25:32) that Meramec play outline and the Woodford play outline?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I'll kick it off and turn it over to John. As we see that Northwest extension, it's really being opened up with empirical results. There are a couple of wells that we're watching carefully. As with much of that section, and I'm \u2013 people talk about, everybody has a different word for it, but I'll just say that Mississippian section, that's Osage, Meramec and then even the Chester above it. It's not always obvious on wireline logs exactly what will produce at what rate, and what the optimum target zone is. And so we're very interested in that northwest piece. We map it as having a fair amount of variability. We don't see it as perhaps having the regional extent that we would assign to the Meramec, but we're watching well results and I'll let John comment on that.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","The only thing I'd add, I think Tom summarized it pretty well, is simply, we are learning a lot with every well out there from an empirical standpoint, because there's still a lot we don't understand, so it is interesting. We have noticed a couple of those wells up there that a certain company announced. And we've looked at our maps and we kind of recalibrate our maps at that point, we say okay, that's a different expectation than maybe what we may have originally had. But that \u2013 I got to be honest, that's been kind of true for this entire Meramec play from the very beginning. And so there will be some surprises to the positive as well as to the negative as we go along here, and we continue to monitor it very closely.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great details. And then just one follow-up, John, for you or Tom. On slide 11, where you show the pounds of sand per lateral foot in your various plays. I think myself and others consider you all certainly the pioneers of a lot of these enhanced completions. My question is, it looks like from July 2016 to January 2017, you didn't really step up the sand, and I'm wondering your thoughts. Have we hit diminishing returns in some of these areas, and you're comfortable with that new, or is this just sort of something temporary on that?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes, this is John. I guess I'll give you my standard reply. First is, I rarely ever track pounds per sand myself, that's something I know from the investment public that they like to see. We focus all our energy in our meetings more on the pounds and fluid we pump per cluster, which is the entry point into the rock. That's where we spend all our talk, and that's where we concentrate.","And yes, we're focusing a lot in terms of those entry points and how much sand and fluid do we need in terms of the best stimulation, especially from a development standpoint. Now, out of that comes a pound per sand calculation and so far, yes, it's remained static, but I don't know that that's necessarily going to be true going forward. All I know is right now we really are focusing on that individual cluster, and how well is it simulating a rock and I think that focus then has led us to gain more confidence in what we talk about today in terms of the tighter spacing pilots we're about to embark on, because I think we're understanding better what rock we are stimulating along that lateral and thus giving us confidence to go even tighter, where in the past we never thought we would be there.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. I want to just follow up on that. We're really analyzing down to the minute detail the efficacy of our completions. And our understanding really rocketed ahead in 2016, and we're continuing to do some very interesting experiments that are gaining a clearer and clearer understanding. We may find that we go to lower pounds per foot and yet we think we're more effectively stimulating the rock. This has tremendous implications to our spacing. It has tremendous implications to our cost structure. We are learning some things that may allow us to be much more effective in how we stimulate these rocks and that will be a way we can perhaps compensate for what Joe talked about with our increased simulation cost. So, that pounds per foot is a pretty fuzzy look at what is a lot of detail.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great granularity, guys. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jason Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Morning, Jason.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tom, I just wanted to come back to the updated guidance. At the high end of the capital program by our numbers, I think you will be spending just a little bit of your cash at strip prices. I think in the past, you've talked about potentially spending that cash over two years. Just want to get your updated thought process now on that cash balance, just in terms of spending it, keeping on the balance sheet or maybe even M&A.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I will be very clear on that. It's an easy question to answer. That cash is there to be deployed. Now, the nature of our assets are such that in increasing our capital, it's really a fairly complex planning process. If we're going to add three rigs here or three rigs there, we really want to deploy those rigs where they count for us. And so we're still trying to deploy where we learn some things and we're really trying to not be wasteful with our assets over the long-term. And anybody who works at Cimarex can tell you that we have really, really beat on one another to make sure that we've developed these assets with the full development in mind. We don't want to be wasteful.","And so it takes some planning. Now, when we first started, we made a decision in November that you know, we really thought we had the wherewithal, we had the returns, and we had the interest to step it up a little bit above and beyond what we discussed in our last call.","Well, this morning, Mark and I reviewed a model that we put together in late November, where we had capital, approximately what we announced yesterday, and yet it showed us burning through our cash on hand over the next 18 months to 24 months. And what's happened in the interim is our cash flow is up. And so, when we made the decision to increase our capital, we thought we were going to be deploying a fairly significant amount of our cash on hand. And turns out, because the quality of our assets and the commodity moving up a little bit, our cash flow's really, really recovering nicely.","So, I said in my remarks, we had a wherewithal to do yet more and we'll be studying as the year goes on, but that cash on the balance sheet is kind of moving target and it's being kind of preserved by a very healthy increase in cash flow.","Now, you also mentioned M&A. We're always in the hunt for good opportunities, but the hurdle is high. It's going to have to compete with the other internal investment opportunities that we have for that cash flow. We are exploring, John's going to want to spend a little money on land this year and we really salute that, but it's a moving target.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for the color on that, Tom. My second question is maybe a little bit different direction. Crude in Culberson is higher \u2013 typically higher API it has to take some deducts and may have some transport issues. So, just given the growth in this area from both Cimarex and your peers, especially as you focus on them, the more oily Upper Wolfcamp, do you see any issues on this front, I mean I guess how are you guys and the industry set up to cope with it?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is Joe. I can answer that. In Culberson, we've put together an arrangement with Plains to truck and haul our oil out of the basin. We typically have not had issues with regard to the gravities that we're producing out of the basin. We've got about, I want to think, 70-some odd percent on pipe. I got that number right here in Culberson. Culberson is 70% on pipe. Takeaway has not been an issue with the announcement of the three larger pipes out of the basin. We also feel that won't be an issue downstream and our contracts are such that we are able to sell the high gravity and control the RVP on the crude.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Joe. Thanks, everyone.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","We've not had an issue there.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Morning, everyone.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Morning, Drew.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I was hoping you could talk as a follow-up just to Jason's question about the spending appetite. If that cash balance weren't there, Tom, if you could speak to the appetite to outspend cash flow, the willingness to outspend cash flow, assuming the returns are there? If that's kind of a outspend the (34:55) cash flow plan going forward, assuming, let's say \u2013 assuming we didn't have the cash balance or whether there is some other considerations in mind?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, we grow with our return on investment and we can do the math on borrowing money at 4% and investing it at many, many multiples of that, it makes good financial sense. So, we're willing to borrow to fund our drilling program. That said, one of our goals continues to be preserving our balance sheet and we probably have a little more conservative view on where we want our balance sheet to be than many out there.","We've been asked from time to time what our debt tolerance is and we've said that we would like to see debt at or below 1.5 times EBITDA. Now, it's above that today, because our EBITDA fell. We didn't borrow any money over the last couple of years. But we see that returning to very nice cushion on that. But on an ongoing basis, we're very willing to continue to borrow. We look at our overall debt metrics and want to maintain a debt level at or below our comfort zone, but that's what our balance sheet is for.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for that, Tom. And can we just touch on the new concepts, you guys mentioned new place. Can you give any color at all as far as what are your preferences, things like over-pressured reservoirs or blanket formations or anything like that?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, this is John. I guess my preference is those things that will lead to good rate returns that will compete with what we currently have, that's one of the criteria when we look at these new opportunities. That's a hard measure, when you're early on in a concept, but that is something we do look at. Outside of that, it's about rate of return. And so, no, I could tell you we're making investments on a number of fronts on opportunities that are very oily and maybe even a little bit lower pressure, but also are there more dry gas and high pressure, it's about the return. And more importantly, it's also about that initial entry cost to get to that opportunity. We look at that carefully as well as the timing.","I mean, we have enough experience now with these new play developments that the timing becomes very critical in our decision, whether we want to embark on a new opportunity, because if you're looking at something with a really short cycle time on your leasing, it takes a lot of capital upfront. It just and again has to fit within everything we're trying to get done.","So what I can say is, our organization has responded to the challenge that literally we laid down last year that we want more opportunities, more exploration, and quite frankly, we probably have more than we can fund right now.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes, Drew, I am very clear with John on what I am looking for. I want opportunities that offer outstanding returns, little risk with very cheap entry cost, and that seems reasonable to me to ask for that.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","And take away from...","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. Yes, and would take away.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I think we all are. So, if you happened to have find the Holy Grail, would you be open to I guess what somebody will call cutting the tails and selling off some of your inventory you wouldn't get to for 20 years?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, we would. What I tell our organization is, our assets today don't look anything like they did five years ago or six years ago. And we will continue to evolve, and I am very willing for our assets five years or six years from now look totally unlike they do today. We just want the best returns we can find. And I really want to emphasize the point John made, this has been a theme that we really \u2013 as 2016 began to feel a little better, this is the theme we really have had throughout our organization, let's get back to generating new ideas, that's what we do best. And the organization has responded just remarkably well, making it very difficult for us to not stretch that balance sheet to fund some things. So, but in answer to your question, we are totally willing for Cimarex to evolve over the ages.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for the color, everyone.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeanine Wai of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Hi, Jeanine.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Good morning.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Getting back to Jason's question on the outlook, I'm just wondering if you can walk us through how you frame the activity this time around, give some interesting color that you'd reviewed your old plan that you \u2013 one of your old scenario plans that you provided back in November? And just for example, was your plan this time around anchored and whatever level you felt comfortable in a downside price scenario or was it more project-based and driven by what you saw you can get done in an efficient manner? I think you stressed before that. There is a lot to do, but it's very complex.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I'll take a stab at that. This is John. I think from November, when we had that initial look, we've had a lot of good outcomes throughout the regions, I would point out in Anadarko. I think some of that initial plan that we had in place had us going to drill I believe some longer lateral dryer gas Woodford wells, which even today have a nice return. But now we have some really nice results in the more updip, both Meramec and Woodford part of our play. And those areas tend to be oilier and they just look that much better from a rate of return standpoint that we'd rather move the capital over to there.","I will tell you that those type of wells don't tend to come on at quite the same high rate as those downdip gas wells do, but they are flatter in their profile. In the end, our decision is based more on, it's just a better rate of return, and that's why a lot of that capital moved from there to where we previously had it back in November.","The other thing I'll comment on is like within the Permian, it's fair to say that there was a lot of thought that we'd go maybe more toward development on somebody's banks and yet based on the spacing pilots, we actually feel like we need to go even tighter with these pilots. And it is fair to say because we are going tighter and I think Joe alluded to that. That introduced as a little bit more risk on the guidance and a little bit more on the timing side, because we are doing those pilots and so that changed the overall nature of that program. But for the betterment, we think that's the right thing to do for the long-term for this company.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. That's really helpful. And then, my follow-up is just in terms of you mentioned timing a couple of times already. What does the timing of the rig ramp-up to the 18 rigs depend on and what situations would that ramp be faster or slower?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, we currently are 11 rigs and we plan on bringing three additional rigs into the Permian here within the next month.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","They'll all be here by April. I mean, we have contracted and those three rigs will be here.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Okay. And then we have in the Anadarko we plan of bringing additional rigs in, four rigs that will come into the fall.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes, those four rigs really it depends on us and our partner come in to a good understanding on how we move forward with that large development project there in that East Cana, the long lateral development. Right now we have that placeholder in place for those rigs coming in, but we still got a little bit of work to do, but that's what our current plans call for.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. We could increase beyond that. But I think you asked what are the signals. We've talked for the last 18 months about that $40 oil floor, being what we were kind of looking for, and I think we're fairly confident as we look ahead. We stress test all of our investments down to a $40 and even a $30 oil case. And we have a lot of cushion in our returns certainly at that $40 downside and depending on the project many of them look very healthy at that $30 downside and that's in our presentation, those are real and now we have results to back that up. So we're feeling fairly confident in an increase in capital program as we look ahead.","Jeanine Wai - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my call.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I just wanted a few. First of all, could you just kind of help me pull together these variables that are going on in the Cana infill program? Your partner talked about type curve outperformance and some 5,000-foot laterals which they had completed in an adjacent project. Slide 26 illustrated larger completions in infilling. I'm wondering is one variable I think more important than the other. Do you see the push for longer laterals in the Cana, kind of the go-forward method? Just any color you can give me there would be helpful.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. This is John. Well, first off, I think both us and our partner very much recognize that on a go-forward basis from a development standpoint, long laterals is where we want to be in the Cana-Woodford. They actually have four long laterals on the current development that they're fracking that, we're all paying close attention to, but we have high expectations for. And so, I would say that the first thing that we'll really lever greater rate of returns for that development is indeed going to longer laterals, which is what our plans currently call for later in this year.","But I'll also say, we've been very pleased with this rock and as Tom stated, we got this tightest 12 wells per section and do not feel like we're seeing any degradation in the performance of those wells. And so, that's why we stepped out to do this much tighter spacing product that we're currently drilling, right now. We'd like to get that under our belt and see what that result looks like and then use that to influence what that later long lateral development look like there in the Eastern part of Cana.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And maybe a little simpler one here. Slide 12 mentions Ward County reevaluation, I haven't heard too much discussion about Ward today, I was just wondering if you could add some color on it, what you are looking for there and will it receive any activity in 2017?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. This is John. We have just finished recently completing an Upper Wolfcamp well on Ward County. We have plans for second one there. Some of this is driven by some recent competitor wells that come on in the area. It's also being driven by our frac innovation. I will tell you about two years ago to three years ago, we drilled a number of Ward County wells and that they were underperformers.","We now go back and look at those wells and we now realize, A, we probably landed them in the wrong zone and, B, we completely did not frac them appropriately. And so, we're taking another look at that acreage, and that's kind of where we find ourselves. Now obviously the proof will be in the results of the wells, but we're encouraged so far with what we've seen from other operators, and that's why we've gone back into that acreage.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. Ward County is a wonderful fairway. The challenge is that a lot of our acreage is sitting where the Third Bone Spring has already been developed with horizontal wells and that Third Bone Spring is really right at that Wolfcamp Bone Spring boundary. So you're coming in right below an existing fracture network and that's what John talked about completion innovations. It's threading the needle and the challenge has been, can you come in underneath those older depleted fractures and make a new modern completion.","So, we're very optimistic. We have some things we're trying that are direct consequences of some of our learnings over the last year or two years, and as John said, we're flowing our first well back now.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And if I could just ask a follow-up real quick, just on what you just said. I just want to make sure I understood the problem. Is it more that there may be some concern that there is some reservoir exhaustion because of all the Third Bone Spring development or is this more like, say, in the DJ Basin where there's just a million wellbores all over the place and you've got to kind of sneak around them to not get into trouble or is it a little of both?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","I would argue it's actually neither of the two. We don't have a resource in place issue in terms of how we see it. It's more of the \u2013 what we start to observe is the existing fracture network that the Third Bone Spring wells created. And how we can ensure that when we come in with a new borehole in the Upper Wolfcamp that a lot of our frac energy doesn't go right back into that fracture network, essentially that that well fundamentally changed the stress properties of the rock. And so what we look at is how we can tailor our design to kind of stay away from that and maximize what still looks to be a very good resource there in the Wolfcamp. That's kind of what we're trying to as Tom said thread the needle with.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Well, thank you. I appreciate that clarification. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Pearce Hammond of Simmons. Please go ahead.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. There was helpful commentary in the prepared remarks about current well cost, so thank you for that. I just want to clarify, I think you had mentioned a 4% to 15% increase from Q4 and was that just on completion cost?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. This is Joe. That was just for the completion side of the equation. So that would be your water sourcing, fracking, stimulation and initial flow back. And there is a tremendous degree of variability there, because the size of the job, John mentioned some of the experiments we are doing. And your total well cost is obviously, then \u2013 completion cost is a function of service cost, your sand cost, your chemical cost, your sourcing cost. So how all those play together, it's hard to come up and just say, hey, here is our increase.","What I can tell you is that the service side has been the biggest increase that we've seen. If you look at our service cost per stage as compared to Q3 2016, it might be upwards of 20-plus percent per stage, but we've managed to control other costs through efficiencies of sourcing and what have you. And so it's really just \u2013 the range I gave you is kind of where our current AFEs on the completion side are now, taking into account current frac designs and the current cost today.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Great. And then, John, as far as the capital budget for this year is concerned, how much service cost increase is baked into that?","Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes, Pearce, this is Mark Burford. We have a small amount built into the upper end of our range. If you look at our range of $850 million to $950 million on drilling and completion cost, if you looked at our completion cost component for the second half \u2013 or last three quarters of the year, and looked at some minor amount of inflation has to be built into the upper end of the range for that capital guidance.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Okay. Great. Thank you. Yeah, go ahead.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is Joe. I might add some too. The previous guidance that we issued in Q3 or the Q3 call, really didn't take into account any of this. And so to some degree, yes, I think it was $600 million that we quoted, that did not account for any completion cost escalations going into 2017.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Prefect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Tameron of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Couple of questions. Just big picture, as I start thinking about potential increase in service costs, or I guess the increase in service costs. And overlaying that, as far as the higher intensity wells relating to frac jobs et cetera. Is there \u2013 when you start talking about your costs \u2013 or starting to equate where you were in the first part of the year in 2016, how do we think about productivity gains versus \u2013 is there any template or any framework you can give me as far as, if service costs go up 30%, then we start having to back off some of the sand because the frac job doesn't make sense anymore. Is there any color along those lines as far as that toggle going forward?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I can take a stab at that. We've had pretty good luxury of being able to innovate with costs on a per unit basis being exceedingly low. One of the numbers we track is what it costs us to pump a pound of sand in a stimulation cost. So take all the cost, water, pressure pumping, sand, chemicals, throw them all together and just what does it cost us to place a pound of sand in the reservoir.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","In 2014, we were at $0.34 per pound of sand. Now, during 2016, we hit a low of $0.106 per pound of sand. So our cost per unit of sand went down two-thirds, and that gave us the tremendous latitude to experiment with tighter and tighter stages, tighter clusters, much more sand, much more fluid, because our cost per unit went down.","Now, you asked, how do we view it? I'll tell you exactly how we view it. We view it through a rate of return lens. We look at what's the incremental stimulation dollar and what's the incremental production in cash flow that the well will produce, and is that a good incremental return on that incremental dollar. And that's exactly the lens that will carry us forward in an era of service cost inflation. We will look at probably dialing back a little bit. If service costs inflate above and beyond what we're currently discussing, we will be pressured the other way. We will be pressured to find cheaper and cheaper ways to stimulate our wells, and that's what John and Joe and their groups are doing with the innovations that we're currently working with.","We have a toolkit in place that if costs go up, I expect we are going to be able to dial back, keep a pace and not suffer from a well performance or a return standpoint. But the proof will be in the pudding, but our lens will be rate of return and we get asked about this all the time, we're certainly going into it with our eyes wide open and a modest degree of concern \u2013 but a modest degree of concern. We will deal with it from a rate of return lens when the time comes.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. So if I think about, let me just ask a follow-up on the rate of return. What I think about how you, I guess you were to rank your assets, if you will, on rate of return, if Wolfcamp Culberson was number one before, or just today versus six months ago, any change as far as how you rank your assets on a rate of return basis?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is John. No, not really, I mean still to this day, these Upper Wolfcamp, Culberson wells are just tremendous wells in terms of the makeup of the hydrocarbon, the amount of oil, and then more importantly the profile. We have shown often how, on a cum timeslot for the first six months these wells would just stay flat, and that just leads to incredible returns but I'll tell you we're awfully excited about a number of our plays like we're going to go back to drilling in the Avalon. We had some tremendous results last year that we talked about in the Avalon and we don't think we've even scratched the surface in terms of frac innovation in the Avalon. That rock has a tremendous amount of resource in place and I think we're just now recognizing that.","And then even up, I would just say there are parts of the Meramec that look very good, very, very good from a long lateral, especially long lateral perspective. And then finally, there are parts now of the Woodford and the more liquid rich part where some of the long laterals we'll bring it on testing in are more liquid rich areas that we'd really like to return to, seeing out of that.","So, I think our rate of return profile looks very, very attractive for us. But we're always constantly challenged especially with service cost to always try to find ways to make it even better and that's kind of our metric, that's what we do every day here. How can we make it better both from a cost standpoint, but also from a well performance standpoint?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","And this is Joe. I might add that those experiments, if you will, lot easier to take on in a falling cost environment as compared to stable or escalating cost environment, but nonetheless in either case you want to look at the overall economics of design A or B or program A or B, yes.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Our next question will come from Joe Allman of FBR. Please go ahead.","Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thank you. Hi, everybody.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Hi, Joe.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Hi, Joe.","Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","So, I think you answered this somewhat, but I just want to see if there are any other factors. So, in your new guidance, your D&C CapEx is up about 50% and your production is up only about 1%. So, I know you under-spent in the fourth quarter by about $50 million. Could you just go over the factors that caused that fairly big increase in CapEx but relatively small increase in production?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I'll take a stab and then Joe can give little more detail. Certainly the timing of when that capital is spent and the nature of the projects are the biggest coupler between when the production comes. And, Joe, I'll say we had a little angst over this. We looked at it and said will the Street misunderstand this. And I'll tell you that at the end of the day we looked at this and said we could deploy that capital in other areas that gave us quicker production hits and we said no way. These are outstanding returns, the production will come when the production will come. And as you know, we manage and view Cimarex on a longtime horizon to generate full cycle returns for our shareholders.","And so, the fact that the production in many cases is pushed at the tail-end of the year into 2018, as John said, in some cases these are projects that have very flat production profiles, but don't have quick hits on production. We made a decision around the return on the invested capital. And that's the only consideration. And so when we look at the timing of the projects when the production hits and also the nature of the projects, some of these are development, it is what it is.","Now, from what we telegraphed in November to today we have also redirected a lot of our capital to the Permian because of the outstanding results we're seeing there, we want to take advantage of that. But those are our main considerations.","Joe, you want to touch on that?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","I think Tom hit them all on the head. I mentioned earlier, Joe, that the $600 million number we quoted before didn't include any cost escalation. So there is some component of that. We add the rigs into this year's program and they show up Q2 and near the end of the year get a good chunk of our drilling done by the end of the year and all of a sudden what we find is that our capital deployment is middle to the end of the year. Our production coming on is middle to the end of the year. The complexion of the portfolio mix to oil is going to have a little bit different Mcfe per day, add for a given oil well versus if there was a Cana gas well.","And when you put it into blender and turn it on, and you get what you get, that's where our number came out, and Tom hit it on the head. It's all about rate of return and that's what we're worried about. And when you look at the plan, springboard into 2018 looks nice. We got a great exit rate, and a heck of a bump in our oil, and so we're pretty excited about the forecast and not too worried about how it looked compared to last quarter.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Joe, I'll just finish with that because I know it's on everybody's mind and I appreciate the question. We also as you know had some delays in our production in 2016, and we \u2013 we like to hit our guidance, who wouldn't? We like to issue guidance that's real that we believe and that we're going to achieve. We like it to be stretch goals that pressure us to do our best in getting there. But when we looked at some of the things that bid us in 2016, we risked 2017 fairly aggressively. Now, it is what we think it is, but it's risked in a way that's probably a little more than we've done in the last couple of years.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. This is Joe. The Wood State is a great example of that. Those delays in getting a three-well pad on production impacted Q4 production by 5 million a day. And so the timing risk, we can't control, we don't predict when we're going to have operational issues or any kind of delays in the plan of development.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","So, in a world where everything goes right, there are no hiccups at all, we're probably too conservative, and we wait every day for that world.","Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","That's very helpful. Just other few quick ones. Your DUC count at year-end 2017 appears to be about 29 based on one of your slides. What was that DUC count at year-end 2016?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes, Joe, we'll have to follow up with you offline on that. I don't have that handy on the year-end picture. Is it in the press release?","Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","We heard 2015?","Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.","Did you say 2015, Joe.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","2015.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","He said 2015, yeah, year-end 2015.","Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.","Sorry.","Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, John, you mentioned, you focus on pounds per cluster.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes.","Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And so assuming the trend there has been an increase in the sand per cluster. But I just want to check that, has the cluster, the number of clusters moved up more than the amount of sand or vice versa?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, each play I would tell you, Joe, is a little bit different. But I think it's fair to say that we are deploying far more clusters in a typical borehole than we ever did say a year ago, year-and-a-half ago, and that has been a big change for us where there is a feeling that you couldn't get those clusters too close, but we've kind of broken through that wall and based on our monitoring what we see, we focus a lot both on that sands per cluster, but more importantly, how tight can I put that cluster, because again that's the entry point to that rock, and I would argue \u2013 I say often the more entry points, effective entry points I have for that rock, the better chance I have of having a well stimulated rock, so yes. Part of that pounds per foot is really driven by the total number of clusters going up in the sands per lateral.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes, Joe, there is some irony there, because some of our first generation stimulations that may have had 800 foot to a 1,000 foot \u2013 a 1,000 pounds per foot, we think we're very ineffectively stimulated. So I think our direct answer to your question would be, we think we are pumping less pounds per cluster today than we were three years ago or four years ago, but we think we're getting better distribution along the borehole and more effectively stimulating the lateral. And that's the challenge, and there are about eight different knobs that lead to that conclusion. And as we said early in the call that pounds per foot number is probably the least effective measure of those knobs.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. Our next question will come from Phillip Jungwirth of BMO. Please go ahead.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks, good morning. Your year-end 2017 rig count of 18 rigs, if you were to hold that activity level flat into 2018, would you anticipate outspending cash flow at current strip or given the high quality nature of the asset base strong returns, is there a chance that you could still be within cash flow?","Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. Hi, Phil, this is Mark. If you look out in the 2018 the current at that level of capital spend that would be increasing from 2017 to 2018, but since we right taking these rigs in through the year, our increasing capital would be another 30% to 40% over what we are experiencing in for 2017. At that level of capital we probably would be at the strip of around $55 oil royalty or gas price to using up a bit of that cash into the 2018.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. And then...","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","So we couldn't maintain that pace with cash on hand, but we haven't made that decision yet.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. And then of 2017 Culberson Wolfcamp program how much is going to be focused on the Upper versus the Lower clearly returns in the Upper are superior. And then over the next couple years, how would you anticipate this mix changing?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well this is John. I don't have that exact number of breakdown. What I'll tell you is, yeah, so far right now the upper areas are looking very strong from the standpoint of return, but I also tell you, we love \u2013 like we've seen in the past lower with the Flying Ebony well, we now have the Tim Tams coming on which is taking that, that frac design and we have high expectations for that. We are however in a very fortunate position based on all the drilling we've done to date that yeah, we are going to have that optionality kind of going forward. Most of our acreage now is held that it doesn't force us to have to \u2013 as you know in the past, we've always wanted to drill lower first to ensure we hold all rights. So yeah, you could argue going forward, there probably will be a greater mixture for upper and lower, but I don't have that right off the top of my head right now.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jorden for any closing remarks.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I want to thank everybody for your good questions.

I'll get the call turned over to Tom.","Thomas Jorden","Thank you, Mark, and thank you to all of you on the lines, participating in today's conference. We sincerely appreciate your interest in Cimarex. I'd like to take a few minutes to touch on some of the highlights of the year before turning it over to John and Joe for a more detailed update.","We ended 2013 with 2.5 Tcf equivalent in proved reserves, which was an 11% increase over 2012. Production was up 11% year-over-year as well and we look forward to grow roughly 13% in 2014. Because of our efforts in the Permian region, 26% of our proved reserves are now oil. Revenues reached a record $2 billion in 2013 and our debt increased to $924 million, which represents 19% of our total capitalization.","Operationally, 2013 was a remarkable year for Cimarex. We saw continued high rates returns from our Bone Spring drilling in both the Mexico and Texas. We unlocked oil-prone Avalon Shale development in our Lea County, New Mexico acreage through new completion technology. And we saw opportunity in a multi-pay Wolfcamp shale expand across our Texas acreage. Without a doubt, the sheer size of Cimarex's Wolfcamp opportunity became much clear in 2013.","One of the things that happened in 2013, as we saw a dramatic increase in competition in the Delaware Basin. We normally don't welcome competition, but it added a lot of data points, the information floor accelerated greatly, and the stars aligned deploying to the high-quality of Cimarex's core position in that play.","We started the year with a good, but albeit fragmented opportunity in Culberson County, which was based mainly on the development of the Wolfcamp D bench. Later in the year, we proved that the Wolfcamp C and A were also productive, and in June we signed a joint development agreement with Chevron, which solidify the Culberson acreage, making it possible to test long laterals and ultimately optimize development.","Simultaneously, we found multiple Wolfcamp pay across our acreage in Reeves and now Ward Count, as evidenced with today's announcement of initial 30-day production from the Worsham well, a Wolfcamp A test in Ward County. In addition, we tested long laterals and have been working on perfecting well completion by using upsized fracs and include more stages as well as higher volumes of profit.","Today, we were proud to announce results from our first well that combined two. The Montrose LL 45 Unit Number 1, a Culberson County Wolfcamp D well was completed using an upsized frac with a 10,000 foot lateral and had a max 30-day rate of just over 2,800 barrel of oil equivalent per day.","This is significantly higher than our original completions of Wolfcamp D wells. The Montrose looks to have an after-tax rate of return in excess of 85% and the peak 30-day rate now well may end up being even higher than what we've announced, because we haven't seen the well declining yet. This well and the opportunity it has really speaks to the opportunity that joint development agreement allows us to capitalize.","In Culberson County, that entire over 100,000 acre gross position is available for full development with long laterals, and these results with long laterals and more that we're currently drilling will allow tremendous development efficiencies as we exploit this with long laterals.","We're currently working to determine development parameters in Culberson and Reeves County. We have four separate spacing pilots underway and each tends to go along way and giving Cimarex the information we need to begin Wolfcamp development in 2015. And we look forward to sharing those results with you as we go. One of the things that you see as you look at Cimarex is we try to stay disciplined and when we talk about 30-day results, and with some of these wells we've had to kind of restrain ourselves, because the initial flow back has been extremely encouraging.","As we look ahead, I think I can speak up for the entire executive team, we're very proud of our organization. We're proud of the way our organization is adapting to a changing business for doing multiyear planning for acquiring the science we need in order to make prudent development decisions in the future or building and identifying the infrastructure we'll need for future years. And really organizing and performing in a way that will allow us to optimally exploit this tremendous resource that we control. You're going to see some detail here in the comments that Joe and John make.","And with that, I'll turn it over to John Lambuth to discuss those details.","John Lambuth","Thanks, Tom. I'd like to quickly cover some of the highlights of our overall program before getting in to the Permian region. I'll then finish with our Mid-Continent drilling program.","Cimarex had a busy 2013, we drilled and completed 365 wells during the year, investing nearly $1.6 billion, 65% of that was invested in Permian region and over 30% in the Mid-Continent region. In 2014, we estimate capital expenditures to be $1.8 billion, up over $200 million from 2013, a result of the continuous success we've had in the Permian region.","Speaking of the Permian, in the fourth quarter we drilled 43 wells bringing our total wells to 175 for the year, which equates to 115 net wells contributing to our growing production and reserve base. Throughout 2013, our drilling was focused on the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations in the Delaware Basin. The 2013 Bone Spring program included 18 net wells in the Mexico and Texas. Results continue to be good, generating some of the company's highest rate of return with oil volumes representing up to 84% of the first 30-day production.","The 2014 program looks to provide similar returns on the $375 million of invested capital plan for the year. Although our inventory of Third Bone Spring wells in Ward County is dwindling, we continue to have about a 200 location inventory Bone Springs, which equates to about two year inventory of drilling. These locations identify throughout our acreage in the Mexico and in Culberson County, where we've identified a thick highly productive Second Bone Spring sand.","Moving to the Wolfcamp, as Tom mentioned, 2013 was an exciting year. With the drilling of 26 wells we worked our whole acreage, while adding production from five new Wolfcamp zones, the Wolfcamp A and C in Culberson; the Wolfcamp A and the B\/C zone in Reeves; and the Wolfcamp A in Ward County; all of this at very attractive rates of return. In addition, we tested the long lateral concept and have worked to optimize completions with upsized fracs.","To illustrate, I'd like to direct you to Slide 12, in our latest Corporate Update posted on our website. This graph compares to traditional Wolfcamp D completion with our first upsized frac, the Tim Tam well. As you can see, not only has the upside frac had an impact on the initial production and initial decline rate, but most importantly on the returns.","Investing additional $700,000 increased this before tax internal rate return from 30% to 77% and NPV10 more than doubled from $4 million to $10.7 million. Now, in fairness this well has only been on production for five months. However, two additional wells using the same frac design have been completed in Wolfcamp D with similar results to that Tim Tam.","The Montrose well announced today, which has a 30-day IP of 2,800 barrels of oil equivalent, incorporates both long lateral and upsized frac technologies. This 10,000 foot lateral was completed with 36 frac stages. We have another 10,000 foot lateral flowing back now in Culberson that was completed using 43 stages. The product mix on the Montrose well is 765 barrels of oil, 7.5 million cubic feet of gas and 65 barrels of NGL, assuming full recovery. It's a fantastic well.","About half of our Permian drilling capital in 2014 or about $685 million will go toward further delineation of Cimarex's Wolfcamp opportunity on the 180,000 net acres we have currently identified as perspective for the Wolfcamp. This includes down spacing pilots and wells drilled to hold acreage.","I'd like to briefly take you through the design of the pilot we have currently underway. You can see an illustration of them on Pages 15 and 16 in the presentation. In Culberson County we have two pilots underway. One is testing the concept of producing from lateral stack in the Wolfcamp C and D. These two wells are currently waiting on completion, which is scheduled to begin in late March. The second Culberson pilot is designed to test 80 acre down spacing in the Wolfcamp D. This is a four well pilot and the wells are currently drilling with a completion date schedule for May.","We also have two pilots drilling in Reeves County, both are down spacing pilot and both are in the Wolfcamp A. One of the four well 80 acre pilot similar to the one in the Wolfcamp D in Culberson, while the second one will test a 106 acre spacing, which is equivalent to six wells of section as well as testing the liability of stacking laterals in the thick Wolfcamp A section.","Lastly, in the Permian, Cimarex has added Avalon drilling to its portfolio for 2014, and we plan to invest upon a $150 million drilling Avalon wells this year. Avalon has become perspective, because of the redesigned completion technique we tested in 2013. It is an upsized frac design that includes more stages, higher volumes of profits and adding 100 mesh to the mix. The five Avalon wells drilled in 2013 had average 30-day IP of 1,080 barrels of oil equivalent per day with over 700 barrels per day of oil. We plan to drill another 15 to 20 wells this year and identify over 200 potential locations on our acreage.","Now, onto the Mid-Continent. The Cana-Woodford Shale play continuous to account for the lion share of our Mid-Continent activity. In 2013, we participated in a 149 Cana-Woodford wells completing 52 net wells. CapEx in 2013 totaled about $400 million in Cana and will drop to about $250 million in 2014 as our partner has suspended drilling activities in Cana to focus on other opportunities for the time being. Of that $250 million, Cimarex plans to spend about $200 million will be used for drilling and completion activities, including approximately $60 million for drilling new wells and $140 million on completions of wells drilled in 2013 and 2014.","Of note, the success we've experienced with the upsize fracs in the Permian is now been tested in Cana. The most recent set of completions included four wells that were fraced using 20 stages. We are at the initial stages of the flow back of these wells, but early indications are very encouraging. As planned in January, we move two of our operated rigs from Cana to the Permian, leaving two operated rigs working in the Cana region.","With that I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph Albi","Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'll touch on usual items, our 2013 production. I'll talk about our 2014 and first quarter of production outlooks, and then I'll follow-up with a few words on our operating and service cost.","While we closed out Q4, reporting average net daily production for the quarter of 704.5 million equivalents a day. That came in about as expected, after accounting for the late November and early December whether in pipeline shutting impacts that we reported to you in our December press release. And as we're all aware, we've had an extremely cold winter this year, and its impacts on our production, not only impacted us in Q4, but also a flowed a little bit into Q1, albeit not to the extent we saw at the end of last year. And I'll touch on Q1 here in a minute.","With Q4 coming in at 704.5 million a day, our full year 2013 average net daily equivalent production equated to 692.6 million a day. That was above the midpoint of our beginning year guidance, which if you recall, we gave and issued at 680 million to 700 million a day. It was also a record for the company and an increase of over 11% over 2012.","As you recall, we had some property sales at the end of 2012, which if we incorporated that into our numbers for 2013, as the impact of that, we were up 13% over 2012 and we're pretty proud of that statistic. With our focus on the Permian, our 2013 oil production jump to a record 36,659 barrels a day. That's up 17% from 2012, and if we adjust that for those yearend 2012 property sales, our Permian oil was up a very respectable, 23%.","As expected our Permian activity drove our production growth with our 2013 Permian equivalent volumes averaging 319.9 million a day. That's up 56.2 million a day or 21% over 2012. On an oil equivalent basis, that's an increase of nearly 9,400 BOEs per day. As John and Tom both mentioned, our Delaware Wolfcamp and Bone Spring programs turned out some great results during the year and they're showing up in our numbers.","Our 2013 Permian new drills added equivalent production of over 114 million cubic feet equivalents per day, that's an addition of 19,000 BOEs per day to our production for the year. With our Texas and New Mexico Bone Spring program making up about 80% of that wedge and the Wolfcamp program making up the balance.","With our continued focus in Cana, we also saw a production grow in the Mid-Continent during the year. With our 2013 Mid-Continent net equivalent production coming in at 346.2 million a day, that's up 7% over 2012. The majority of our '13 Mid-Continent activity was, in fact in Cana, which bumped our 2013 Cana average production up to 221.9 million a day, that's up 42.7 million a day from 2012, and again another 24% jump. So significant production increases in both Cana and in Permian, with that being the focus of our activity.","So as we look forward into 2014, our updated model continues to support our beginning year 2014 guidance projection of 760 million to 800 million a day and that corresponds to a 10% to 16% growth rate over 2013. And as was the case in 2013, our projected growth is expected to come from the Permian, where we're directing nearly 80% of our 2014 capital. We'll have the strong focus on the Wolfcamp in the Permian this year, and as such we anticipate the Wolfcamp to be the dominant contributor to our 2014 drilling wedge.","Similar to the profile we saw last year, from a total company standpoint, our forecasted production this year calls for production ramp-up post Q1. Our first quarter net equivalent daily volumes are forecasted to average between 696 million and 700 million cubic feet equivalents per day. That's in essence flat to Q4. Well, there is couple of things at work here. First, our Q1 volumes incorporate a reduction of about 13 million to 15 million a day for recent weather-related downtime and the plant shutdown of our Triple Crown pipeline facility in Culberson County.","We're excited to get started on the work in Triple Crown. We're going to be enhancing the liquid recovery capabilities of the system, to better conform to new delivery points of the central portion of the system, and also to help protect against future line freezes like we've seen over the last two winters.","Also limiting our first quarter volumes is the initiation of the four Wolfcamp spacing pilots that John mentioned. We have the two in Reeves County and two also in Culberson County. Combined, these four projects comprise a total of 16 wells. Our plan is to grow the wells in each pilot first, and then complete the wells in each pilot, once drilling has been completed. And as such, none of these 16 wells will have first sales until the second quarter.","Also with varying working interest in the wells that we drill, the overall timing of total company net completions has been varying quarter-to-quarter. And taking this into account for both the Permian and the Cana areas, our total company net well completions just dropped from an average of 17 net wells per month in Q3 '13 to 10.5 net wells completed per month in Q4, and we're projecting to increase that number of completions from back up to our Q3 '13 levels here in late Q1 and Q2. So the bottomline to all this is, is similar to the production profile we exhibited last year, we're projecting 2014 growth to take foot in the mid-to-late Q2.","Jumping now over to our operating cost. Our Q4 lifting cost came in at $1.11 per Mcfe, that was at the low end of our full year guidance range of $1.11 to $1.16, right in line with our Q1 '13 average of $1.17, our Q2 '13 average of $1.11, and our Q3 '13 average of $1.15. And with that our full year 2013 lifting cost settled in at a $1.13 per Mcfe, that's flat with 2012, despite the cost pressures we've seen in items such as SWD, compression, power, fuel, rentals, et cetera.","Especially in the Permian, where we're generally seeing higher operating expenses for items such as lift, compression and water disposal. With our focus on LOE over the last three years, we've been able to fight off those pressures, while reducing our Permian lifting cost from $1.88 per Mcfe in 2011 to $1.50 in 2012, and now down to $1.48 in 2013.","So across the board, our production team has done just a great job of keeping our operating expenses in check. As we look forward into 2014 with our continued focus in the Permian and our overall focus primarily on liquids growth, we're projecting our 2014 lifting cost to fall in a range of $1.12 to $1.22.","A few words on service cost. First with regard to drilling cost. With tools, equipment and services readily available in each of our programs, we continue to see most costs components stay relatively in check. Day rates appear to be in the same boat, although we are seeing the market for top-drive rigs tighten up a bit from last quarter.","With these costs somewhat flat, our drilling group has made great strides to reduce our drilling cost through program efficiencies, especially in the Permian, where our continued focus on bit technology and rotary steerable drilling has helped us cut our AFE drilling days over the last year in each one of our programs, the Texas and New Mexico Bone Spring program, the Avalon program and the Wolfcamp program.","On the completion side, we've had no difficulty securing frac equipment or crude, and we continue to experiment, as John mentioned with different frac designs. In general, through operating efficiencies, and I need to mention the efforts of our service providers, we've enabled to capitalize on stable to softening service and material cost in order to help offset some of the cost that we've been seeing with the larger jobs that we've pumped.","In Cana, after years of program drilling, we continue to see performance and cost improvement during 2013, cutting our growing cost per foot by 25% from the levels we saw in 2012. And with that our current core AFEs are now running in a range of $6.3 million to $6.9 million, again that's primarily depending on the size of our frac.","In the Permian, our Second and Third New Mexico Bone Spring AFEs continue to run in the range of $5.7 million to $6.5 million, depending on debt. That's down about $400,000 to $500,000 from where we were a year ago. Our shallower Texas Second Bone Spring AFEs are holding flat at $5.1 million. That's also down about $500,000 from a year ago.","And our West Texas third Bone Spring AFEs continue to hold flat at $6.4 million to $6.5 million. That's well below the $7.5 million that we were incurring back in 2012.","In the Wolfcamp, we're gaining some traction with program efficiencies. As an example on Culberson, we've seen our average days to TD for 4,500 foot Wolfcamp lateral, dropped from 39 days in 2012 to 33 days in 2013. We have seen the same improvement in the Reeves Ward County areas with our Wolfcamp average days to TD again for 4,500 foot lateral dropping from 28 days in 2012 to 22 days in 2013.","That said, we're still in the very early stages of program drilling the Wolfcamp. Especially, when considering the broad geographical area that we're testing with the play, extending itself from Southern Eddy in New Mexico down into Culberson, and then over to the east into Reeves and Ward Counties. As such, we're obviously excited about the progress we've been making, but we are also seeing, potential gains still yet to be made as we get more wells under our belt.","As John mentioned, we've upsized our completions into Wolfcamp and we've seen some vary favorable results. Those upsized completions are running us anywhere from $600,000 to $700,000 per well. And incorporating those costs, our current generic Wolfcamp AFEs are now running in the range of $8 million to $8.5 million, with our Culberson County wells, falling on the higher end of that range, and our Reeves, Ward County wells on the lower end.","As we continue to experiment with long laterals, we are projecting our 10,000 foot Wolfcamp laterals and Reeves County to run into $13 million to $14 million range and that's solely depending on our whole design configuration. If we drill a 7,500 foot lateral, we'll probably take about $2.5 million off those numbers.","Again, we're still in the very early stages of not only the Wolfcamp, but drilling these long laterals and our drilling team is pretty excited about creating the efficiencies that we've seen in other programs as we continue to drill more of them.","In closing, we had a great 2013. Our programs are doing great. We saw record 2013 production. Our LOEs in check and development cost continue to head in the right direction, great momentum to start-off 2014. Reiterating what tom said, part of our growth last year was helping our organization grow together to develop these program plays from just finding the locations, to drilling them ,to producing them and putting the infrastructure in place and then the overall administration of the program. So we'd made great progress. And we're very proud of the organization.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question we have comes from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley","In your opening remarks, you talked about multiyear development planning, just hoping you could talk about Culberson County to begin with, I guess going through, how long you need to hold your acreage there? How many wells that entails? When you might be able to be drill more Wolfcamp A wells, and I guess, also when do you think you might be drilling more of those 10,000 foot laterals?","Thomas Jorden","Well, Drew, this is Tom. We are indeed looking at a multiyear time horizon and we have to. I mean, we've got decisions to make today that will impact 2018, 2019. We have to collect the science and do the spacing pilots in order to come up with prudent development plans. We don't know what ultimate spacing will be. I mean John talked about 80 acre spacing. He talked about 105 acre spacing. Today, we can't tell you that it's not 40 acre spacing. We just don't know until we go out there and test it.","And we're looking carefully at competitors, but right now we're not throwing a lot of spacing pilots going on the Delaware Basin, other than our four. We have one competitor doing another space pilot issue, but we're having to create these data points to setup our out years. So we have to do the science required for out year developments. We have to build the infrastructure and we have to club the financing plan. So we are looking at that year at out years.","You asked about Culberson County, overall in the Basin, we're on a glide path to hold all of our acreage, certainly all of that we see perspective, which is darn near every acres. And that's a very manageable program. If we do the minimum, it would probably be $350 million a year for the next few years, but we're accelerating that and we'll front load that, so we can get that held earlier.","Your question also was about Culberson County and Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp C, Wolfcamp D. It depends by large on the lease. Some of our leases, we can hold all Wolfcamp with one well, so we can choose the zone. Other leases, we have to drill the deepest target first in order to hole the deepest interval, but a lot's changed since we have gone into this project, and one of which there was a day when we would have said, we think the Wolfcamp A is our most economic target. Today, we don't know.","That Montrose well was landed to Wolfcamp D. And it's arguably the best economics of any well we've drilled in basin. And so we don't know, if leases were a concern, I can't tell you today, which would be our primarily target. We've got a lot of experimentation with these long laterals and upside fracs, before we can make that kind of economic high-grade.","And finally, you asked about future development. We do have a development plan and its changing everyday, based on these pilot projects, that's why we're doing them. We don't think we're going to have any issues with land going into full development, whether that would be Culberson Reeves or Ward we don't know today, but we're getting for it.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley","I guess, going back to the HBP question. Do you have a sense of when do you might have that Culberson position held? And then I guess going back to those long laterals, what would I guess changed your -- how many wells you're drilling on that 10,000 foot lateral basis?","John Lambuth","I can address right off about the laterals. We have drilled two now, I mean we have talked about one. Going forward, currently in Culberson for the rest of this year, we have three more 10,000 foot laterals planned, One into D, two into C. We also have seven 7,500 foot laterals. Now you might ask yourself, why not 10,000, and quite frankly that's because of the way the acreage lined up, we were able to drill 7,500 because of the way the o sections were.","We have seven of those going forward, four into D and three in the A. So we have quite a few now that that we're planning. And obviously from the results we talked about we're very excited and trying to move quicker towards the path and towards drilling those type of wells. I mean, as far as holding our acreage, I mean we have a schedule and we kind of know each year what kind of capital that schedule requires. We do tend to front in that, meaning we try to get ahead of it. It's safe to say, with certainly by the end of 2017, we'll have a majority of that held or maybe just a few wells maybe we have to do, but we'll be in pretty good shape by '17 for sure.","Thomas Jorden","I want to make one follow-up point. All of our pilots are 5,000 foot laterals and we don't see that as -- in everything we learn on the pilot, we view it will be directly applicable to a longer lateral. And so we're doing our pilots on 5,000 foot laterals, quite frankly, because we can get them drilled faster, completed quicker and we spend a little less per well as we experiment, but everything we're learning in this pilots should directly translate to longer laterals.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley","One last one for you, do you have exposure to the stack play in Merrimack in Oklahoma? Is that something you've been testing?","John Lambuth","As we recognized the play, as we see what our competitors are doing and as we map it, we do feel as though that that interval definitely carries over into our Cana HBP acreage. Quite frankly it looks very perspective based on where they're putting their laterals. And we are developing plans to aggressively move forward and tested here in the near future on our acreage, at least some initial tests.","Operator","Next would Cameron Horwitz of U.S. Capital Advisors.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors","Question, Tom, you talked about Culberson being pretty well set out to moved along longer lateral development there. Can you just talk about the setup and reason Ward counties? How much of that do you think you can move toward the longer lateral development?","Thomas Jorden","We have a fair amount, and I'll let John chime in, but certainly in Reeves County, there is a fair amount of our acreage that would support long laterals. I'm looking at John, half maybe?","John Lambuth","I would say, at least half.","Thomas Jorden","The challenge in a lot of these areas is it's parsed up land-wise. So it's a nice thing when you get these continuous acreage blocks. Ward County, we have some good continuous acreage blocks, but whether that will be -- I don't know if that will support for 10,000 foot lateral. We may have some 7,500 foot laterals to drill there. But when we think long laterals, based on what we seen, we're going to do it everywhere we can. But it really harkens back to the real value of that agreement between Chevron and Cimarex. Long laterals were strong motivator for both companies to enter into our joint development agreement and the results we're seeing are really, really reinforcing that decision.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors","And I guess sticking with that topic, I mean can you just talk about the interplay with moving the longer lateral, I mean obviously you're getting much more right upfront and just how that dovetails with thinking about facility and midstream build out there?","Joseph Albi","It obviously plays a big role in that. The resources needs not only, as far as batteries, equipment, but also people. And as we continue to look forward down the road as to our resource needs, this all plays a big role in that. So we're trying to optimize every which way we can. There is not only just operational efficiencies to be gained, we also firmly believe there is tremendous capital efficiencies to be gained as well.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors","And then just jumping, same to Culberson, and then jumping at Bone Spring, it looks like you had a pretty nice uptick in terms of the average productivity on those wells from last quarter. There is some talk about some upsize frac from some initial comments in that area. Was that playing at all into the results or is that in the balance of just the natural variability.","John Lambuth","I would probably lean more towards the natural variability. We have played with the frac design. Tom mention, it is kind of nice in Delaware Basin that there are a lot of competitors, and we pay very close attention to what others were doing. We learn from that. In the case of the Bone Spring, we have tried some upside fracs. I would say, right off the bat, we got the kind of uplift we were looking for, but still the jury is still out. Those wells are still in early flow back.","I would also point out that we're just getting more and more comfortable with that region in terms of what we're looking for, in terms of what we're putting those laterals in the Bone Spring. I think that's what's showing up in the kind of activity results we're getting there. I mean it's turning out to be, without a doubt, that Second Bone Spring in Culberson, some of the highest rate of return wells we're drilling right now.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors","And then just lastly Permian. I know it's not a focus area for you guys, but I think you drilled a few wells over in Reagan County. Just kind of curious what the plan is there, if that's an area where you look to expand or potentially a monetization candidate?","Thomas Jorden","Probably in that case more monetization and we have some legacy acreage there. Our team did a nice job of identifying the potential there and there was enough acreage to justify what's going out there and doing a couple well test. We're still in flow back on those wells, but we were encouraged enough from the results that we have budgeted some money this year to drill some additional wells on that acreage block. But this is not a very big position for us at all. It's more about just taking advantage of having that relatively small track of land right there in Reagan and drilling on it.","Operator","Next we have Jason Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","When thinking about the drivers behind your production guidance growth for 2014, have you assumed any uplift from the upsize fracs like you've seen from Tim Tam or from the longer laterals or is there a bit of conservative in both in there?","Joseph Albi","When we first put our plan together, we had limited data. So the answer to your question at a fairly high level is, yes. We've incorporated production uplifts on a risk basis for our Wolfcamp program and that's built into our numbers.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And with your initial Ward well out of the way and with you saying earlier that you probably don't have as much acreage to drill longer laterals on there. Should we expect you to maintain a fair amount of activity there or do you expect to shift the focus really back to Reeves and Culberson? And what do you have to hold acreage-in in Ward?","John Lambuth","Well, we expect to be still fairly active in Ward. We do have acreage to hold. As you know, we picked up a nice block of acreage last year that we will need to overtime here drill on. But, no, the actively level will be pretty good at Ward, because we have a lot of acreage there, but we also have a lot of testing delineations still to do there. Of the three areas is the one where we've done our lease drilling.","So we still have a lot to do to learn and understand how perspective that acreage is, I'll just point out, not just in the A, but I would argue throughout the entire Wolfcamp section there. We haven't really stepped down into the deeper section yet, although we talk about doing that at some point later this year in Ward.","Thomas Jorden","We're quite high on Ward. It's not a stepchild by any means. We currently have 18 rigs running in the Delaware Basin and four them are in Ward County. So it's a good project.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I'd like to squeeze one more, and you guys haven't talked at all about potentially testing the Delaware zone. Do you have any plans to do that, as you go through this delineation here?","Joseph Albi","We don't have any plans as of right now, as we always talk about, we recognize it. It's just obviously our first primary purpose, when we drill the well in a new section like that is to hold acreage and so we're going to the deepest target, where we can get good rate of returns. We will get there eventually, but as of right now, we don't have any plans.","Thomas Jorden","There's no mystery there. We like the Delaware group. We've drilled a lot Delaware in our history. The thing is it's relatively uncontrolled out here. It's a big thick package, sands come and go, and you need to map it with control. So every time we drill a Wolfcamp well, we add another point of control, we're mapping as we go and we see it as future objective, but it certainly will be part of our 2014 program.","Operator","The next question we have comes from Phillip Jungwirth of BMO.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO","There were some well in Ward County had a pretty comparable IP rate to the typical Third Bone Spring well that you've drilled in the past over there. But is there any reason to expect that you might see a shallower decline rate in the Wolfcamp than you've seen in the Bone Spring?","John Lambuth","We don't know. I think honestly just time will tell in that case. I don't know that -- I guess I'll just say we don't know. We just need more production history here to tell us whether or not we can get a different type of decline profile than what the typical Third Bone Spring sands do. So we'll just have to wait and see.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO","And then on Slide 14 in the presentation, where you mentioned Ward County, in that slide are you saying that you don't think the Wolfcamp B through D is perspective and Ward that you just haven't tested that yet?","John Lambuth","And you're referring to Reeves County?","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO","Ward County?","John Lambuth","Right now, I can't really comment on D. Honestly, when we look at Ward County, the next sound that we get really excite about is really the B\/C. Now, I don't know that really look much at D, I think it does thin there some, but I can't really comment. Nobody's, really to my, recollection has drilled a D well in Ward County.","Thomas Jorden","Just on Slide 14, our wells and targets that we're currently exploiting that we view our economic. So in Ward County, we only have one target there, because that's all we've drilled. We will be testing the B\/C as John said. It looks highly perspective to us. We didn't include on the slide, because we don't have any results.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO","And then on Slide 12, the old curve looks like the 5.5 Bcf case from last year. But I was wondering what the EUR assumptions are for the Tim Tam well? Just looking at the graph and the PV10, it looks like it could be a little bit higher than the 30% increase in IP range that you've talked about from upside fracs?","Thomas Jorden","We're not prepared to comment on EUR for a well for which we just have a few months of production. We're going to have to watch it. And it does look like it's a little shallower decline in our original wells. And we're seeing greater than a 30% uplift certainly on sustained rate. But time will tell our EUR there.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO","Then the last question, how much opportunity is there to expand your existing Avalon oil acreage and then also the Reeves County acreage positions?","John Lambuth","I must say that Avalon position we have is right in kind of the sweet spot of where the best Avalon wells are being made. And so it's pretty tightly held by a number of operators. We're fortunate enough to have the position we have to develop those locations. So I don't see much in a way. There is no acreage necessarily just go out there and lease, it's tied up pretty tight. Your second question? I'm sorry.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO","Reeves County, Wolfcamp?","John Lambuth","In terms of additional acreage?","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO","Yes.","John Lambuth","Well, it's safe to say, yes. We are still actively trying based on our mapping to continue to acquire acreage, and we continue to be somewhat successful in doing that. But we still are having some success picking up new leases in that play.","Operator","Next we have Brian Gamble of Simmons & Company.","Brian Gamble - Simmons & Company","Guys, just a follow-up on the acreage question over there. As far as your position in Culberson and the relative availability of the longer laterals, does that new tactic of doing this many long laterals as you can, focusing more attention on potential acreage swaps and bulking up acreage in prices where you and some of your neighboring operators will be benefited from that sort of agreement.","Joseph Albi","Well, boy, I'd love to think we could do that. Obviously, what made the Chevron JDA so perfect for that is because it was a check report. Essentially they were the white squares and we were the black. So by putting that together it was a natural fit. In other areas, it all kind of depends on how your acreage flows relative to your competitors and your peers and what you could do there.","I mean if there was a situation, where we felt like there was someone who had a comparable acreage position that we paired up it would lead to longer laterals, we would probably entertain talking to them. But I just don't know if there is going to be that many situations, just given the lay to land there.","Brian Gamble - Simmons & Company","And then you mentioned stack, you mentioned plans to test it, any sort of timeframe you wanted to put around that, as we talk in to something that's eminent, something that's a back half '14 event?","Joseph Albi","No. I would argue it's more of a latter first, second quarter event for us.","Thomas Jorden","This time we're obviously watching our competitors carefully on that and we see their enthusiasm for the play. We also understand that there are a lot of technology challenges that were faced and dealt in that play. We understand those technical challenges probably. And we see the potential, but boy, there is so much we don't know. We don't know what the yield will be, is it oily, is it gassy, what the deliverability will be. We're going to test it and we'll report back when we have some results.","Brian Gamble - Simmons & Company","And Tom, you kind of alluded that with [indiscernible].","Thomas Jorden","That's underway and we'll report, it will be midyear.","Brian Gamble - Simmons & Company","And last one from me, as you guys walking through the Q1 production impacts and how those wells come on in the very variability of timing of things. It seemed to indicate that the run ramp for production obviously starts in Q2, but the back half of the year from a percentage gains basis would probably be stronger, is that a fair assumption to make?","Joseph Albi","I mean to get to the 760 to 780 and start off where we are in Q1, it's obviously a ramp up. And the ramp up as we've currently got it scheduled and all this can vary with completion schedules, frac schedules, crews and what have you, calls for a good ramp up here in the later part of Q2.","John Lambuth","And reality always can intervene on the best plants, but I'll say this, we have shy of one rig of the rigs that are fully baked into that plan and we're on track here. So the model is what the model is. It's back half loaded.","Joseph Albi","This is the exact same type of profile that we put out in front of you guys last year and we did it.","Operator","The next question will have comes from Jeff Robertson of Barclays.","Jeff Robertson - Barclays","Can you all talk about the time you need to evaluate these new frac techniques to figure out if you're having the right recipe before you start deciding whether or not there is a variable you need to change?","John Lambuth","I guess it would depend on which engineer I talk to because depending on who I talk to, they all wanted a difference amount of time. There are certain things we look for, obviously what's and rather so excited about Culberson is just that initial IP and that 30-day rate we see, that clearly was a step change relative to our other wells as our graph shows.","But I'll be honest, some of these other wells, it doesn't really show up some times early on in the production, but it definitely shows up a good 90 days, 120 days later in the client profile. So sometimes it could take a good 90 days to 120 days before you really sell like you've made a type of change that's going to be material in terms of that overall EUR.","Jeff Robertson - Barclays","Do you think you'll have data by the time you start completing some of the wells, some of that pilot test you're drilling on pads in the second quarter.","John Lambuth","Well, we feel very good about our frac design right now, especially in Culberson, very good. Now, I would argue in Reeves, we haven't drilled as many wells. And I would argue that we still have potential to dramatically change that frac and do even better Reeves. The resource there is very thick. It maps very good for us.","And so we still have some homework to do their in Reeves in terms of optimizing that frac, but I'd like the job, we have right now that we're doing as evidenced by some of the results we've talked about in the past. So going forward, we feel very good about our current stimulation for that area.","Jeff Robertson - Barclays","John, I think you mentioned you all are going to take that technique or some variation of it up to Cana this year? Did you say how many wells you have on inventory?","John Lambuth","What I can speak to is we have taken from the Culberson completion and we've taken it to one of our sections and we have completed four wells now in Canada using that frac style and we are inflow back, and again you can sit here and argue how many months is it going to take to tell whether it makes a different or not. But I'll just simply say, as I said earlier, the early signs to us are encouraging. And certainly that's something probably by next earnings call, we'll have a lot more information to tell you about on those wells.","Jeff Robertson - Barclays","Last question on the Reeves County where you all will drill the stacked pilot in the Wolfcamp A, in Culberson or in Ward is a Wolfcamp A where you show it beginning a little bit thinner, is it thick enough or is it there trying to do any kind of a stacked spacing test as well.","John Lambuth","We don't know. I would argue. We will probably test it, since we just don't know.","Thomas Jorden","Is it thick enough? Is it sufficiently thick to absorb to pilots and stack them and we're going to probably test it.","John Lambuth","We are constantly amazed based on what others are doing not just within the Delaware Basin, but other Basins and how tight people are starting to put these laterals, vertically from each other. And so that's something we recognize, and yes, and in Culberson A we will more than likely touch that.","Operator","The next question we have comes from Abhi Sinha of Wunderlich Securities.","Abhi Sinha - Wunderlich Securities","I just had couple of questions. One on Avalon, just trying to get how uniform the acreage is or how continuous the acreage is basically, so I'm trying to evaluate how did you get to 200 locations? Is it just like acreage or spacing or there is more specific location wise?","John Lambuth","Again, we're very lucky in the Avalon. There is a lot of drilling that's taking place. A lot of pilots have gone forward. And right now, everyone is kind of gravitating to six wells a section. So really there's nothing more than just taking our current perspective acreage position and then planning out to six wells per section to get to that well count.","Abhi Sinha - Wunderlich Securities","So just as a follow-up. The technician that you've brought in Avalon versus what you experienced last time. My guess is like in the last experience, three years ago, when you drilled some wells, you experienced a high decline rate. And the techniques that you're applying right now is geared towards getting a higher IP. Are you doing something to tackle the high decline rate in terms choke size or anything like that or is it more towards getting higher IP, which will get you higher returns.","Thomas Jorden","In the cast of Avalon, you're absolutely right that early on in that program when we drilled the completed wells, we've got very good IPs, but then they would fall like a rock within the first 30 days to 60 days. Quite frankly, with this new frac design, we don't really experienced very high IPs at first, but over time the wells continued to clean up to whereafter 30 days to 60 days, we then reached our peak IP. And then we see much slower decline. So that's what's been the biggest change as per that frac design, which has led to that kind of result we're having. So we've fundamentally had changed kind of the flow back profile of those wells based on that frac.","Jeff Robertson - Barclays","And on the Wolfcamp side, can you comment if you have any presence of Wolfcamp in your New Mexico counties like Lea or any counties like one of your smaller competitor just reported a well in Lea County I guess having the Wolfcamp presence?","Joseph Albi","We have acreage in that play, especially up in the White City area. But we also recognize that that it could expand even beyond there. We just haven't got to the point of testing it just yet in the areas like Lea County like you're mentioning.","Thomas Jorden","White City is in Eddy County, and that's actually where we drilled our first Wolfcamp well in 2009.","Joseph Albi","An area quite frankly we're looking back at now from along lateral standpoint. It to us right now that area looks very perspective now, because of these long laterals.","Jeff Robertson - Barclays","And lastly, could you just remind us, how your rig distribution looks like right now? I mean considering you increased the rig count in Permian from 12 to 16 and it decreased in the Mid-Continent, but I'm not sure what the non-activity looks like in Mid-Content and how the rig distribution look likes versus Bone Spring versus what you have in Wolfcamp?","John Lambuth","Well, I can tell you exactly, what's going on today, but also in 30 days it will change, because obviously any one rig we have could move from a Bone Spring to a Wolfcamp well. But as we speak right now, we have nine wells, soon to be 10, drilling Wolfcamp wells. Six wells drilling Bone Springs and then one well drilling in Avalon, and then there is another rig testing other types of concepts for us right now.","So right now that should bring you to 18 with the 19 rig coming some time in the April, May timeframe. In terms of Cana, we have the two operated rigs and then we have a partners has six rigs. But our understanding is they will be winding down the rig count to essentially zero some time here in the second quarter, if not sooner in Cana.","Operator","Matt Portillo of TPH.","Matt Portillo - TPH","Most of my questions have been answered, but I want to do just follow-up on a few. In terms of your acreage position, you mentioned perspective acreage in Reagan, and then also some perspective acreage in the stack. I was wondering if you could put any context behind that in terms of the size of those positions?","John Lambuth","Well, I can say this much in terms of the Midland Basin right now we have seven wells scheduled for Midland on that acreage. Again, the 2014, I think there is some follow-up ones in '15. It's not a huge position.","Thomas Jorden","It's not going to be more than a few dozen wells in absolute total.","John Lambuth","And then in terms of stack, I honestly I don't know, we really have a good number on acreage right now. We're still trying to map it to get a better definition of it. We have a lot of acreage over, I'll just say that much.","Thomas Jorden","I can tell you that most of what we know about stack, we've gleamed from the internet. And we see the same mystery that our competitors do and that the long response look somewhat enigmatic and competitive that's ahead of us to call core, and now is unlocking the play to them. We've taken a long-haul core, it's currently being analyzed.","As John said, as we map that interval it comes over most if not all of our 75,000 acres held by production acreage. And I just told you about the full technical analysis. We're analyzing the rocks. We are going to test it and the proof will be in the pudding. But one of the many unknowns, two of them are the rate, the ultimate deliverability and the hydrocarbon type. And we can do all the science in the world, and then the well will tell us the answer and that's underway.","Matt Portillo - TPH","And then in terms of the Avalon, I was wondering if you could put any context behind how you guys are thinking about the EURs in the play, even if it's kind of a wide range around it, just trying to get a sense of what your recovery maybe there?","John Lambuth","I'm not going to quote an EUR as much as I'll just say again, the rate of returns right now on our Avalon wells are pretty much competing right there with our Bone Spring wells. It's turned into a wonderful rate of return play for us. So we're very, very pleased. And then thus you see the amount of capital we're going to allocate to it this year and aggressively drill it this year.","Matt Portillo - TPH","And then just last question, Gulf Coast has become kind of diminished within your overall portfolio. I wondered if you could give us some color on the plans there kind of in 2014 and then on a go-forward basis on what you maybe looking at doing?","John Lambuth","It saddens me to say being a geophysicist that at the end of '13 we've made the decision to close down our Gulf Coast region, as an active exploration region. It really reached to point where with the totality of all the opportunity we had in the Permian and quite frankly Mid-Continent and the type of rate of returns we're generating, we just felt like the Gulf Coast cannot be as impactful as it has for us in the past.","And quite frankly, we have extremely talented people in the Gulf Coast that we felt like we could better deploy in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent efforts. So at the end of '13 we did that. We have at best maybe one or two prospects remaining that we like, that we may drill in the '14 and then that would pretty much close the door on our Gulf Coast exploration program.","Operator","It's showing that we have reached an hour, we will go ahead and conclude with our last question for today. It will be Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","So a couple of quick ones for you. Following-up on the Avalon, the couple of hundred locations you have talked about in Avalon so far, is that spread across all acreage review as perspective there. Do you have any upside to that potential in Avalon acreage?","John Lambuth","I mean, when we quote those locations, we're really talking specifically to that one area in southwestern Lea, that that quite frankly the best wells are being drilled. And that's where we concentrate our effort. As I said earlier, for the previous call, that acreage is tied up very tight. There is not a lot of additional opportunity to expand upon that. So right now that that's where we're concentrating our efforts.","Thomas Jorden","The Avalon is perspective over a very broad part of the Basin. In fact, our one of the best Avalon wells drilled, there's a well we drilled in Eddy County, a very gassy well, a very high deliverability. So could the Avalon expand? Absolutely. It's a function of product price. So it's reservoir and it produces over much of the Basin.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","Speaking of price, obviously, has pretty strong gas prices and slightly better NGL prices than we've had in a while. Any thoughts on use of -- I mean I would imagine given the commodity prices that we have right now. I know it's early in the year, cash flow is probably tracking ahead of budget and ahead expectations. Any thoughts on how you'd prioritize use of potential excess cash? And whether you think about increasing activity at all maybe Cana in or targeting opportunism in gas.","Paul Korus","We have not changed our capital program expectations for the year, yet. We're still at $1.8 billion. Coming into the year, we envisioned outspending our cash flow by $300 million or $400 million. The higher product prices and higher revenues simply mean, we'll most likely borrow less.","Operator","And gentlemen, did you have any closing remarks at this time.","Mark Burford","Thank you everyone for joining us today on the conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings and Operations Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mark Burford, you may begin your conference.","Mark Burford","Thank you, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our fourth quarter 2011 results conference call. We have issued our financial and operating results news release, and it's been posted to our website this morning. We also posted in our website a presentation that we will refer to from time to time during today's call. And I will also point out that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call, and I refer you to the end of our press release and our presentation regarding our statement regarding forward-looking statements.","On today's call here in Denver, we have Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; and Paul Korus, Senior Vice President and CFO. Paul will make some opening remarks around our financials, and then we'll turn the call over to Tom and Joe to go over the operations.","Paul Korus","Great stuff. Our earnings release detailed very positive results of operations for 2011 and a favorable outlook for 2012. Before turning the call over to Tom and Joe to describe these accomplishments and expectations, I'd like to briefly reiterate just a few financial highlights.","First off, I need to mention ahead of our review of 2011 is challenged by the fact that it's often compared to our record results in 2010, a year in which we hit on all cylinders and set new highs for most measures. Not even Jeremy Lin scores more points each and every night. Still at 2011, we achieved even greater revenues in cash flow than we did in 2010. Our revenues reached nearly $1.8 billion versus $1.6 billion in 2010. Our cash flow from operating activities rose to $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion a year earlier. ","Our earnings were also strong. Once again, we exceeded the $500 million mark. In 2011, net income totaled $530 million or $6.15 per share. That compares to $575 million or $6.70 per share in 2010, a year in which we had substantially larger hedging gains and non-recurring income from the early extinguishment of some debt.","As this usually indicates, the prices we received for our production of oil, gas and natural gas liquids had the greatest impact of anything on our financial results. In 2011, price realizations for oil and natural gas liquids increased by more than 20%. On the other hand, gas prices were 10% lower. During the year, our production and revenue mix changed as we came more tilted towards liquids output versus natural gas. In 2011, about 50% of our production was gas, with 44% being oil and natural gas liquids. Combining with the effect of prices, however, roughly 70% of our revenues were derived from oil and natural gas liquids, with less than 30% coming from gas. ","The shift in our production mix is no accident. It reflects the choices we make for capital investment. So even though we may not always deliver as robust overall growth rates as some would like to see, we continue to make good profits and are able to do so without levering up our balance sheet or issuing equity.","We had good growth in our proved reserves during 2011 and have an equally active capital program plan for 2012. With quality cash flow at a very strong balance sheet, we have a lot of flexibility for how we fund our 2012 program. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden","Thank you, Paul. I'm going to be working off the presentation that's posted on our website. So if any of you have it up, I'll be starting with Slide 7. If you don't have it up, it's not really that important, but there are some figures in there that might help as I talk.","In 2011, we invested a hair under $1.6 billion in exploration and development. We drilled 174 net wells, and as Paul said in this other release, we had extremely solid returns in our Permian and Cana programs. We grew our proved reserves to 2.05 Tcf equivalent, which is a record for us. Our Permian Mid-Continent reserves proved increased 26%, an all-time high of 2 Tcf equivalent. We added 587 Bcf equivalent from extensions and discoveries, and 45% of those adds were liquids, 55% gas. All in all, we replaced 272% of production. But the real story, and we'll get onto that as we give you a little detail, is our record 2011 Permian Basin and Mid-Continent production of 487 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Those 2 regions in aggregate showed a 16% production growth over 2010.  Those are our engines of growth. ","On Slide 8, it shows our core operating areas, now many of you are familiar with this but just to recap, of that 2.05 Tcf equivalent, 98% are Mid-Continent and Permian reserves, and fully 89% of our production are Mid-Continent and Permian. So those are the engines. ","On Slide 9, it shows us graphically. Slide 9 shows our proved reserves as they've increased the last few years. We have a very solid reserve base. As Paul said, our investments have pulled us towards liquids-rich areas. That's in part tactical, a little strategic, but it's mostly driven by the invisible hand of the disconnect between gas and oil prices, and we are just in a very nice position with one of the best Permian assets amongst our peers, and we can emphasize that oil production by simply shifting our weight. As you can see in 2011, we ended the year 41% liquids; 59% gas, that's a nice healthy growth; compound annual growth rate of 54% of liquids growth, and we ended the year with 82% proved developed reserves, 18% proved undeveloped.","The next slide, Slide 10, shows our proved reserves by region, and this again shows the solid growth that we're seeing out of the Permian and Mid-Continent. We've been growing the last few years, a compound annual growth rate of 28%. In 2010, we did sell our Riley Ridge asset in Sublette County, Wyoming. That was 210 Bcf of proved undeveloped gas reserves. That's the gray bar there on your slide on 10. We replaced those reserves, and accounting for that still increased our proved reserves 9%. If net of that sale, if we get back that sale out, we increased our proved reserves 23%. So a very solid year on a reserve basis. ","Moving on to Slide 11, and now, we'll talk about 2012, which is really the story for us today. 2012, we're going to -- we're giving you a capital range and that's because that we're in a rapidly changing environment. We have a lot of flexibility for 2012, we have a tremendous opportunity set, but we're going to say here this morning what we said for years. We are going to adapt and change to a very changing environment. So one of the things you'll hear us talk about are plans with Cana and plans with the Permian, and those are fungible. Right now, as everybody in the industry, we're watching gas prices carefully, we're watching liquids prices carefully. Depending on local conditions, we may switch some capital from Cana to the Permian or not. I mean, right now, we're seeing outstanding returns in the Permian, and our Permian group is hungry for more capital. ","Our reserve and production adds from 2012 drilling are expected to be 40% to 50% liquids. In the Permian Basin in 2012, we're currently at 11 rigs and we're planning on averaging somewhere between 11, peaking out at 15 to 16 rigs. In the Bone Spring, we'll get over 60 wells drilled. And our unconventional plays of the Wolfcamp and the Avalon, we have plans for 30 wells. And on our Paddock play, vertical wells, we have plans for 50 wells. So very, very active Permian program, and I'll give you a little more detail that here in a minute. ","Our Mid-Continent program is expected to average between 10 and 12 rigs for the year, and that would be split between our Cana-Woodford, where we're infilling the core, and we'll drill approximately 110 gross wells there. And outside Cana, we'll have about 20 wells in the Mid-Continent. So very, very active program. As we sit today looking at the landscape, our program is generating very nice returns. As we talked about in the past, we stress test our investments. We're still at a point where we think looking out at today's landscape, we'll be at that $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of 2012 investment.","Moving on to Slide 12, this is just a little pie chart of that investment spectrum that compares 2011 with 2012. It shows that this year, we'll be approximately 94% of our total exploration development capital in the Mid-Continent and the Permian. And again, the Permian at 52% is showing $775 million of capital. I will say that our Permian region is, as I said a minute ago, is prepared to invest more if we choose to ask them to. Very nice returns.","Moving on to Slide 13, and this is really the story for Cimarex here today and it's one I really want to bring attention to. Last couple of years, and I think a lot of people in the industry have looked at our Gulf Coast headwind and our production, and we're happy to say this morning that we feel that issue is fully behind us, that the underlying growth of the Permian Basin and the Mid-Continent assets has stepped up the plate and are really showing themselves the engines of growth that we've all known they would be. Over the last couple of years, we've increased our Permian Basin and Mid-Continent production at a compound annual growth rate of 19%. Our guidance this year, and Joe will give you detail, is between 4% and 10%. We have fully overcome that Gulf Coast headwind and we really look for significant growth, or the opportunity for significant growth, for many years to come. I use the word opportunity deliberately because we haven't changed our DNA. We are still about returns, and we believe that production growth is a very nice consequence of making good investment returns. That underlying Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast -- or excuse me, Mid-Continent and Permian program is generating very nice returns, and it's just affably making this Gulf Coast issue not worth talking about. We still will have a Gulf Coast program this year, but none of that is built into our guidance. And it -- and we're at the point where we're growing this program where it's no longer the relevant issue it's been in the past couple of years.","Slide 14 is really a nice evidence of the Permian oil production and what it's done in the last couple of years through our very active horizontal drilling. Compound annual growth rate last couple of years of 24%, and year-over-year 2011, 2012, we're expecting 26% to 32% growth in our Permian liquids.","So moving on to Slide 15, I just want to give you a little bit of color in our Permian program. You can read that slide to yourself, but the -- really, summary is that we're expecting to invest, I would say $775 million to $800 million of capital in the Permian Basin. We will drill 150 gross wells and that's multiple projects. We're in the Delaware Basin with multiple projects, so just as we value diversity throughout our overall investment portfolio, we have a fair degree of diversity in our Permian. And I'd like to give you a little color on that.","Moving on to Slide 16, I want to talk for a minute about our Bone Spring\/Avalon play. Our second Bone Spring play of Eddy and Lea County, I just kind of want to brag on our team for a minute. In our third quarter call, we talked quite a bit about the wrestling match we had internally with some of our technical challenges. And I want to just compliment our exploration group, our operating group for getting after it, figuring that issue out, and they came back roaring with an absolutely outstanding fourth quarter. And that we are a geoscience-driven outfit that focuses on being good at the business. And we like to talk about results and not hype. And certainly, our third quarter call, we were in the middle of a wrestling match on our own results. And today, we're happy to tell you that it really does look very, very nice as a result of the great work our teams did.","We have some highlighted wells in our second and third Bone Spring play. We're not talking about particular well results, but I will tell you that we brought on several wells on the equivalent basis that are well over 1,000 barrels a day, the first 30-day average. Our release has our absolute program, 30-day IPs of 597 barrels of oil per day. And as we said, there are some really nice wells in that mix. It's generating outstanding returns, and we have a very, very nice inventory of opportunities there. ","We've also had some just absolutely lights-out returns in our third Bone Spring play in Texas. That's a play that, of course, a lot of our competitors are drilling, and that's gotten a lot of attention, and rightly so. We have drilled a number of wells that have averaged well over 1,000 barrels a day for their first 30-day average. I know that some of our competitors have released some results in that play, and we would just say to you that we see it as they do and that is an outstanding play.  We will have in that play, as we look at 2012, we'll have 3 rigs running and currently going to 4 rigs in that play, and that should be a very active investment for us for years to come.","Moving on to Slide 17, just to kind of summarize that, if you look at our Bone Spring and Avalon play, we have significant future drilling. We're having very solid returns in that play, and the issues we discussed on our third quarter call, I will say, our actual to expected results are outstanding in the fourth quarter and moving into this year. That team has really dialed that in. We compete for our opportunity, that's why this issue is important to us. Although even at our -- the third quarter, our results were good, when we're going and competing for opportunity, good isn't good enough for us. We need to be able to predict our results and deliver what we predict. And they've really made some great, great strides in the fourth quarter. We're seeing that play, the second and third Bone Spring play in Eddy and Lea County between 400,000 and 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well. This year, we're currently at 5 rigs in the second Bone Spring play. We'll go to 7 rigs at the end of chicken season here by late spring. As I said in our third Bone Spring play in Texas, we're currently at 3 rigs, we'll go to 4 and then we'll have 1 or 2 rigs running in the Avalon.","But let's move on. I'd like to talk about our Wolfcamp play. We've had some nice recent results in our Wolfcamp play. I am on Slide 18 for those of you that pulled our slide presentation down. We've had a really nice fourth quarter in the Wolfcamp play. We talked last year about some of our development being deferred because of the infrastructure. The slide there shows the trunk line, gathering line we had to build. We had to build roads, bridges, saltwater disposal. We had to put in a little processing facility. Our operations group did an outstanding job getting that online, it's just about complete now, and that allowed us to come in and complete some wells. As the results indicated on the slide there, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we completed 4 gross or 3.4 net wells. And of those wells, our first 30-day average, and this is an average, was 6.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day. And that's 38% gas, 31% natural gas liquids and 31% oil. So we're seeing that play, well over 50% liquids, just generating some outstanding results, our recent wells. As you can see from this map, we're still kind of sparsely sampling this area. So one of the things I would discourage anyone from doing is taking those fourth quarter results, dividing it by some acreage spacing and papering that area with it. But we're drilling our way to understand that. We are extremely encouraged with our recent results. I know there's been some press given to this Wolfcamp play in the Midland Basin. A lot of the people in the Midland Basin are really talking about the Wolfcamp being an outstanding play. I would just say we love this play based on our recent results. We see it as a significant part of our future going forward in 2012 and beyond, and we have an outstanding inventory. If you look at that 80,000-acre position, you have -- we don't know what the spacing is, but if it goes to 160-acre spacing, we've got 400 locations. If it goes to 80-acre spacing, we have over 800 locations. These wells are $8 million a copy. So this play alone is many, many years of drilling inventory at our current Permian Basin run rate. So again, it's a testament to our exploration operations group that built this play from scratch and we're very, very pleased with the results we have to report to you.","I'd like to move on now -- before we go to the Mid-Continent region, I also want to tell you that we have drilled now a couple of Avalon wells in the oil window. We had talked about that play in the past. We're still in the process of evaluating that play. We know some of our peers are very excited about that play, and I will say that based on our recent wells, we're starting to share that excitement. We don't have yet 30 days of production on any one well. We have one well that's a few weeks of production, another well that's got a week of production. But I will share with you that our initial results are right in line with what the industry is seeing. That is a high-decline play, so those wells can and do come on in excess of 1,000 barrels equivalent per day. They do decline rapidly, but they do generate very nice returns at current costs. So we'll have the Avalon being a significant portion of our 2012 program. We'll have one rig running in the Avalon here through much of the year, and we're actually in pretty serious discussions about an 80-acre down-spacing project within the Avalon. ","I'd like to move on, in the interest of time, to our Mid-Continent program, and again, I'm on Slide 19. Our Mid-Continent program, of course, is many different programs. We always talk about the Cana play, but I want to just say, again, we get asked a lot about new ventures. And one of our most active area of new ventures is in the Mid-Continent. We've added a lot of geological horsepower in the last year or 2, and we are working on some new concepts in the Anadarko Basin, which is a very multi-pay, rich basin. And I fully hope and expect in subsequent calls to be talking to you about new horizontal plays in our backyard in the Anadarko Basin. ","And moving on to Slide 20, this is a little blowup of our Cana play. This is the area where we have 120,000 net acres. We've been transitioning into 2012. In 2011, we were testing the Cana D play. And that's the area, for those of you that are looking at the Slide 20, that's the area off to the West at about that 16,000-foot depth contour. And we had very good results, but not sufficient to really make a living at today's pricing. So we've moved back into the core and we're embarking on an infill project in the core, I'll give you a little more color there. But I think you would expect, as you look at 2012 for our Cana program to develop much greater capital efficiency. The returns in the core are very good even at today's market, and we've moved our activity for 2012 into the core.","Slide 21 gives you a little bit of detail. On Slide 21, there is a stippled white row of sections there in the upper half of that slide. That's the area of the core in which we are currently infilling. We're going to 9 wells per section. We have 10 rigs currently running in that infill project and drilling 9 wells or the nominal spacing that people talked about there, a 64-acre spacing. That will be a significant contributor to our production this year, although as I'm sure Joe will talk about, because of the logistics of drilling all those wells side by side, there'll be some delay between when we drill and when we complete those wells. We're drilling those wells from pads. There's 2 wells per pad. They're costing us approximately $8 million per well, and we expect to deliver 6.5 to 8.5 Bcf equivalent per well ultimate production. So it's quite a project. There are a lot of infrastructure involved, a lot of planning, a lot of construction, but it really does look like a project that's potentially going to deliver outstanding returns to us even at today's market.","So in summary, for the Cana-Woodford play, I'm on Slide 22, for fourth quarter 2011, our production there was 158 million cubic feet equivalent a day, which was a 59% increase over Q4 2010. We have significant unbooked potential on that core. We have over 730 net locations, 2,200 gross wells, a 4.5 Tcf equivalent of net resource potential. And as we represented in the past, we have $5 billion to $6 billion in future drilling capital and a large resource potential outside of our core. And we still are doing some science in that deep and hopefully, we can make that work.","I want to end on the Gulf Coast. I'll use a poor analogy. The last 2009, 2010 were kind of binged exploration years in the Gulf Coast, and maybe you call 2011 a hangover year with that binge. We have that fully behind us now. We're still active in the Gulf Coast. We are in the process of acquiring, processing and evaluating at least 3, and possibly 4, 3D surveys. The one thing that we are committed to do is a little bit of planning in that program. We will very much endeavor to get that activity at a level that will space out and not give huge bowl of the swings on our production. But nonetheless, today's story is when you look at our underlying engines of Permian and Mid-Continent, that issue's behind us. I think you can look at Cimarex for what we are, a diversified company, great resource driller, healthy balance sheet and tremendous potential for returns that will, as a consequence, generate growth.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe Albi, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","Joseph R. Albi","Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining our call today. I'll summarize our Q4 and 2011 production, hit on our first quarter and full year 2012 production guidance, and then I'll follow-up with a few comments on our 2012 exploitation program and where we see service costs. ","Starting first, I'm not certain of the number of the slides, but this is our Q4 and 2011 full year projection slide. We had a solid fourth quarter driven by Permian and the Mid-Continent. We reported average net daily equivalent production of 601.4 million a day. That was up 9.4 million a day from Q3, and it beat the midpoint of our guidance by approximately 1 million a day. We spent a lot of time talking about the Permian and the Mid-Continent, and once again, our production statistics reflect that. We set multiple new records in each one of the regions. Our Permian oil production of 19,123 barrels a day, it's a record. It's up 9% from Q3 and 24% from Q4 '10. Our Permian total liquids production of 22,889 barrels a day also set a record, up 7% from Q3 and 25% from last year. Our Mid-Continent gas production of 219 million a day set a record. We're up 4% from Q3 and 12% from Q4 '10. As did our Mid-Continent total liquids of 16,252 barrels a day, which was up 4% from Q3 and 24% from a year ago.  ","The driver in the Mid-Continent here was Cana, where record fourth quarter equivalent production of 158 million a day was up 13% from the third quarter and a strong 59% from Q4 '10.","So as a result, we set record marks for our equivalent production, both the Permian and the Mid-Continent, with our Mid-Continent equivalent production of 309 million a day, up 17% from a year ago, and our Permian equivalent production of 215 million a day, up 18% from a year ago. So combined, the fourth quarter Permian and Mid-Continent production level of 531 million a day was up 17% over the last 12 months.","So we close the books with our 2011 production coming in at 592 million a day. That's right at the midpoint we provided last call and virtually flat to 2010 after accounting for property sales. But as we mentioned last call, on the surface, we may be flat to 2010, but underneath the hood, our Permian and Mid-Continent production grew at 16% and offset the 70 million a day year-over-year drop that we saw on the Gulf Coast.","Hitting on production, Q4 production by region, you can see that our Permian and Mid-Continent production has now grown to the point where the 2 regions make up the lion's share of our production, quite evident when looking at the geographic split of our Q4 production. Combined, the Permian and Mid-Continent now make up 88% of our total liquids and 89% of our gas. On an equivalent basis, the regions now represent 88% of our total company production, with the Permian accounting for 70% of our oil and 51% of our liquids, and the Mid-Continent accounting for 65% of our gas and 37% of our liquids.","Looking forward into 2012 with our guidance, as Tom mentioned, we truly see 2012 to be the year that we get the headwind of our Gulf Coast production declines behind us. Our current guidance model calls for continued strong production growth in the Permian and the Mid-Continent, with little or no new well contribution from the Gulf Coast in our models. As a result, we project the Permian and the Mid-Continent to grow at a combined rate of 19% to 25%, with the Gulf Coast projected to just make up less than 6% of our 2012 production.","With our emphasis on the Permian and the Mid-Continent, we anticipate continued liquids growth from the 2 regions, with combined oil volumes anticipated to grow at 20% to 27% and combined NGL volumes forecasted to grow at 37% to 44%. And as a result, as we've mentioned earlier in the call, we project our 2012 total company liquid percentage to come in at 46%. 2012, that's a 2-point increase over our 2011 level of 44%.","Timing-wise, as Tom mentioned, with production from our Cana infill project expected to come on in late Q2, we're forecasting modest production growth during Q1 and Q2, with accelerated growth projected in the last half of the year. As such, our Q1 guidance fell at the level of -- fell in at the level of 595 million to 615 million a day, and our full year projection came in at 615 million to 650 million a day. I might mention, it's part of that infill project to lever it a little bit. We're drilling these wells in the Cana infill area and we're waiting to frac them until we have a number of them drilled for a variety of reasons. And to give you an idea of what would be waiting on completion as the result of that infill project, we're anticipating that there'd be 15 wells during the May to July time period that are on our frac schedule that are associated with that program. So normally, they would've been completed in a much more accelerated manner, and as a result of our planned scheduling, they'll transpire later in Q2 as far as the completions are concerned.","Shifting gears to our production group focus and the operations group in general, the group put forth another solid year for us in 2011, with a strong focus on the base properties. We did a great job optimizing production and maximizing net operating income, all the while putting $65 million of net exploitation capital to work, performing over 375 projects. The majority of our exploitation capital went towards recompletion activity in the Permian and the Mid-Continent, numerous saltwater disposal projects, primarily in the Permian, and infill or replacement well drilling activity in the Permian and in South Texas. The remainder of the capital was directed to a variety of workover, lift and facility projects throughout our operating and nonoperating areas. And overall, the group just did a nice job of optimizing production and net operating income during the year, all the while putting our exploitation capital to work wisely.","For 2012, our production operations team will remain focused really on 4 simple objectives: Maximizing our net operating income with an emphasis on LOE reduction through saltwater disposal; ensuring takeaway capacity in our core plays by constructing infrastructure as needed, Tom elaborated a little bit on what we've already done in the Permian there; thirdly, effectively deploying our exploitation capital; and then as we strive for each and every year, maintaining our focus to improve our operating capabilities in the field.  ","With our year-end planning process, our production operations group put together another solid inventory of exploitation projects for 2012. We've identified over 400 projects with more than $80 million of associated capital. The inventory was cold and high-graded, resulting in our targeted 2012 capitalized budget of $60 million to $75 million with more than 300 associated projects. Our 2012 focus in the Permian is simply SWD, with the remainder of our workover recompletion, lift and infill drilling activity staying fairly consistent with what we've done over the past years.","Looking at our OpEx, with Q4 lifting costs coming in at $1.18 an Mcfe, we finished the year with an average lifting cost of $1.14. That's about at the midpoint of our 2011 guidance, which was $1.02 or $1.22. As compared to 2010, we saw a considerable cost pressure in virtually all cost components on the LOE side during 2011, but especially the aggregate cost to dispose of produced load water from our new wells. With our focus on SWD projects in 2012, our 2012 lifting cost guidance range of $1.05 to $1.25 is simply just built around the midpoint -- a midpoint equating to our average lifting cost over the last 3 quarters.","On the service cost side, completion costs continue to play a vital role in our total well cost. Completion costs now make up approximately 50% of our total well cost for our horizontal well. As we've mentioned before, we've seen frac cost go up significantly over the last year. That's a result of both the design changes and service cost increases, especially in the Permian. As compared to 2010, our total company average frac cost was up 20% in 2011, with Cana up an average of 8% and the Permian up over 40%. That said, we are seeing relief in service cost, particularly in the Permian, and we'll continue to alter our frac designs where we can to help control these costs.","On the drilling side, with continuing efficiencies and with market costs appearing to be somewhat flat over the last quarter, we've done a good job of funding the completion cost increases that we've seen to keep our total well costs somewhat in check. With good focus on program efficiencies, especially in our infill program, our Cana core wells are still running about $8 million. That's basically flat to the levels we saw a year ago. Our Permian Paddock and Blinebry vertical AFEs, they've crept up a smidge. They're running right now about $2.2 million to $2.4 million. That's up 15% to 25% from Q1 '11, and primarily the result of increased frac and facility costs as compared to last year. ","With the drilling of slightly deeper wells and changes on our frac design in our New Mexico section, the third Bone Spring program, those wells are running around $5.8 million to $6.3 million. That's up from levels of $4.8 million to $5.2 million that we saw at early 2011. We've made great strides in our West Texas third Bone Spring wells with stimulation design changes. We've trimmed those AFEs to levels of $7.5 million to $8.5 million. That's down considerably from the $8.8 million to $9.2 million levels that we saw in early 2011. And as we continue to develop and refine our Wolfcamp shale play, especially on the completion design side, our current AFEs are running around $8 million to $8.5 million. That's up from the $6.5 million to $7.5 million that we quoted last year.","So as we move forward, our operations and exploration groups are obviously going to continue to work together to improve the efficiencies, take it to the next level, work on drilling design and completion design where we can, and ultimately, just like to keep these well costs in check. In all, with the momentum of a great quarter behind us, we're really looking forward on this and to making 2012 really our year for the Permian and the Mid-Continent.","So with that, operator, I think we'd like to turn the call over to any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Lively with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","The -- in the past year -- excuse me, your decision to spend relative to your cash flow levels -- sorry, you really haven't had a policy of not outspending cash flows, but if I look at 2012, it appears that you guys are kind of pulling a little bit harder on the outspend. And I'm just wondering, you certainly have the liquidity to fund that. But just what gives you guys confidence, as you look forward, in terms of why to outspend? Is it confidence in your inventory? Is it just cheap cost of debt, desire to bring forward the inventory? If you could provide some more color on that, that would be helpful.","Paul Korus","Hi, Brian, Tom is pointing to me to answer your question. At 2011, we had the opportunity to sell some assets that didn't have a long-term future for us. So we were able to fund the 2011 program with cash flow and property sales. We came into the year with, also with $100 million of cash. And as we move into 2012, we look at our opportunity set as providing very good returns in the price environment in which we find ourselves, as constructed as well. I mean we could clearly spend much more on gas-oriented projects if all we wanted to do is grow our volumes faster. But we remain very conscious about returns. So our returns are good. If we feel very comfortable continuing with the level of activity into 2012 that we finished 2011 with, we don't know what cash flow is going to be. We all have price forecasts. None of us are likely to be right. So we'll see what happens as the year unfolds. With the current sentiment -- well, at current prices and current negative sentiment on gas, if we use forward curve or your price forecast or anyone else's, we would come up short of our planned capital program. But we have -- this is why you have big credit facilities in place. And it's why you want to always maintain access to capital markets, in our case, particular, maybe debt capital markets. So we're very confident with what we're doing. Our policy has never really been to stay within cash flow. That has been our history, but not necessarily our policy. Our policy has been to fund good ideas that we could execute on effectively and efficiently, and that's essentially what our 2012 program is.","Thomas E. Jorden","Brian, this is Tom. I do want to touch on that, and that's a great question. I will tell you that we debate that every day around here, what should our proper level of activity been -- be and have been. We -- as we look into 2012, it's really obviously all about Permian and Cana. And those are 2 different issues. Cana, we embarked on this infill project last fall and we had at regular roll. We moved 10 rigs in, in a line, and we had some decisions to make. When we first started, we said, well, let's commit to absolutely infill 3 sections, and we had 7 lined up, ready to go. And one of the nice things about our program is we have some flexibility. Of our rigs, we only have a few that are under any term contract and they all go away this year. So we would have and do have the flexibility to ramp that program down and kind of decelerate slowly. So we're still -- the guidance range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, some of that involves, hey, what if we slowed down a little at Cana, and we're debating that. Right now, looking at the markets -- and we run those sensitivities aggressively. We've run sensitivities at a horrible gas price, ethane rejection, I mean you name it, we run it. We think that program generates really nice returns today, and that's a testament to Cana. And then the other issue is the Permian. The Permian is just lights out. There's no question that that is generating outstanding returns at today's cost and today's pricing environment. We have the opportunity and we like activity. We are a high-volume outfit. We always have been. And one of the reasons we like activity is guess what? When we're active, we generate more opportunity. We have an active year, we look up and we have more years of inventory than we did when we started because our generating teams, through their own activity, find more things to do. So we have kind of given Cana the mandate of you know what, we're going to go forward and kind of steady as she goes, and we have some flexibility there. Permian, we said, get her done. Those returns are great. As Paul said, that's why that balance sheet is there, and we're very, very pleased with the returns we have going into 2012.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Well Tom, I tell you, I'm a fan of activity as well. It seems like over the last -- since last quarter, that is, the confidence in the Permian has really improved. I mean you talked a lot about it in the call. But it seems like the readthrough on that is that you're just more comfortable with the overall inventory and portfolio in the Permian. And so, I know you just gave 2012 out, but does that reflect then that your view is you have the inventory now in place to really have that high sustainable liquids growth over a longer duration, more so than just the 2012?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, I think that's absolutely true. Now we don't like to issue 5-year plans. We've never seen any that's ever worth the paper they're printed on. And of course, prices, costs, I mean, I'm giving you all the standard disclaimers here, but we have multiple years of inventory. Our second, third Bone Spring play, this is our best play, has currently 3 to 4 years at our current run rate. If we never generate another idea and we had our only current land on that play alone, we have 3 to 4 years of run rate at our current drilling pace. And we're -- it's our most active lease play. We're continuing to generate activity aggressively through additional leasing. And then, of course, at Wolfcamp -- and we own -- Wolfcamp is still early. I mean my enthusiasm is because that's what I'm paid to do. I believe in our staff and I believe in our internally generated ideas and I've always liked talking about good results. But we're going to see. If that looks like what it's evolving into, that in and of itself is many, many years of drilling and it's very liquids-rich. So the Permian is a sustainable business for us. It's not something where it's a -- we're not having a going out of business sale with high activity in the Permian. It's sustainable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gil Yang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Your proved developed proportion of reserves went up. Is that just from the sale of Riley Ridge, which is a PUD?","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","There was nothing really else going on?","Thomas E. Jorden","No, absolutely not. And everybody has their own philosophy. We try to give a lot of transparency to our assets, and we think we've got lots of things to do for many years to come.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. Can you talk about -- you''ve talked a couple of times about reconsidering the capital allocation between Cana and Permian. Can you talk about the contractual obligations for rigs and other equipment services that would either allow you to do that or prevent you from doing that or create sort of timing issues surrounding that?","Joseph R. Albi","Gil, this is Joe Albi. As Tom mentioned, our rig commitments are really far and few. There are 4 rigs that we've got some type of commitment to with Cana. Those all edge off by the -- or fall off at the end of the year. And everywhere else, it's well to well. So I hope that gives you an idea of what we're contractually obligated to do there. On the service cost side, the only other type of commitment we have is for one of our frac services providers, and we've got about another year left on it. It's kind of one of these deals that we've committed to some capital level of expenditure, and if we don't meet that every month, that we can move that into the next month. So it doesn't really force us to do anything.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If -- to keep that one crew busy, how many rigs would you need to run?","Joseph R. Albi","Well, right now, we've just got one frac crew working in Cana.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. And that's the one that's under that obligation?","Joseph R. Albi","That is correct.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But how many rigs would you need to run to keep that crew busy?","Joseph R. Albi","Oh well, they'll knock off maybe one a week. So you get 4 completions a month out of them.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes. But I just -- I'd chime in, when we made that commitment, that's a crew that we could -- it's a [indiscernible] the Permian. So that's not it. We don't view that as a -- that would not be a factor in any decision we made.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. Okay. I think, Joe, you mentioned that the waiting on completion backlog should rise about 15 by the middle of the year. Will it stay 15 or will it go down, or how does it go once it gets to that 15?","Joseph R. Albi","No, that was just Cana. And if you bear with me a second, I can give you a better idea for that. I think total company, we should be upwards near 25-plus. And then, of course, we'll whittle that down as the infill project matures.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, we're -- again, we have some complete flexibility and it's driving our team crazy. Because our flexibility has keep those 10 rigs running, infill all 7 sections and then go to another row that we have ready to go. So we could just keep infilling Cana until the cows come home here for years to come. But we do have flexibility. We're watching these markets like everybody else is. And we're going to react depending on what the gas and natural gas liquids price dictate. We're not going to destroy capital to keep rigs busy.","Joseph R. Albi","And if we get backlog like we did before, we'll just pawn some additional frac crews. So part of the science of the infill is the completion and understanding how to frac in those wells not just individually, but multiple wells.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So what you're saying is that, that backlog rises or falls based on what your -- whether now you step on the gas in the Cana or not from the current plan, right?","Joseph R. Albi","I'd say that's a safe assessment.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, Gil, you know us. I mean we're going to do what makes sense to us, and I hope everybody hears that loud and clear, that these plans we're reporting are great, but we're -- our only commitment to the shareholders is we're going to make what we think are best decisions for long-term interest of the shareholders.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And the last question is just can you talk about how we should think about the Gulf Coast in terms of -- I know that there's no Gulf Coast growing success in the current guidance. Can you give us some sense as the timing of when the seismic is going to be done, when the inventory will be in place, when you start drilling and how we should think about this potential success rates of those first wells and the new seismic shoot?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, Gil, this is Tom. I -- we tell you that we have a lot of new data coming in and it'll be second half this year before we even have the opportunity to talk about any kind of go-forward in inventory. So I think we've done exactly the right thing, and that's we haven't guided any Gulf Coast production. So we'll know when we get that in, what happens. And I would expect we're going to have inventory, I would be surprised if we didn't. But one of the things that we're going to try to do is space it out a little bit. I mean, we -- I mentioned binge exploration. We've always kind of been a; let's-get-it-done-as-soon-as-possible outfit, and not that we're changing our stripes there, but we're going to try -- I like the fact that we're having a few programs come in that will give us the option to kind of, assuming we have the kind of inventory we're planning, we don't have to get them done all along. So we can space that out, so it will be more manageable in terms of production. But that said, I think I'll just -- you're being horribly redundant. I mean  the thing that we're all kind of excited about is we see this permanent Mid-Continent growth kind of makes this issue, to us, kind of irrelevant in terms of the kind of lower print that may have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Robertson with Barclays Capital.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You all are talking about 19% to 25% production growth in the Permian and Mid-Continent in 2012 over '11 and drilling essentially the same number of net wells at roughly 165 in '12 and 164 last. You mentioned operational efficiency several times in your all's comments in different plays. Can you just talk about how much of that higher production growth rate on the same well account do you think you pick up from operational efficiencies versus maybe drilling different targets than you were in 2011?","Joseph R. Albi","Well, this is Joe. Built into all this, when we look at 2010 to '11 and '11 to '12, there are some timing issues that come into play. In particular from '10 to '11, if you remember, we had a huge backlog of completions in the Permian. I think we got up as high as 30 wells waiting on frac by the middle of the year. And then, of course, we pushed that hard at the end of the year. So when you -- those production results occur at the end of the year and then averaged out over the full year,are a number. I would answer this question, and Tom, chime in too, that the types of wells that we're drilling, the targets that we're drilling, the IPs that we're seeing, we're seeing some better results in the Permian. Cana is coming in as expected. It's more of a timing issue on when we anticipate the wells will be drilled and completed, and then, of course, coming online. I mentioned in my section of the call that we were, I guess, tail end loaded with accelerated production growth in 2012. Our current model is saying that maybe our exit rate, midyear, might be 6 and a quarter, 625 million a day, and with that growing hopefully to levels over 650 million a day-plus at the end of the year. So that gives you a feel for how it's hitting our model as far as it being our equivalent production estimates. I don't know if that helps you out at all, trying to understand how we've modeled it. I wouldn't say it's the type of well that we're drilling other than we are drilling some better wells in the Bone Spring area, the capital efficiency that comes into play, in particular in Cana, where we've kept our well costs in check, and we're going to optimize our drilling and completion dollars, especially the completion dollars, trying to figure out what kind of bang for the buck are we getting on our fracs to try and keep that in line.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Joe, the part of that, just going back into the core of Cana instead of doing more of the step-out drilling and getting more out of the rigs that you're working with?","Joseph R. Albi","Well, I think most of it's associated with pad drilling. You put 2 wells on each pad, we're consolidating services where we can, we're consolidating equipment where we can. You've got reduced move[ph] charges because you're not moving[ph] from well to well. Our facility costs are lower. We've utilized biofuel on 6 of our rigs. That's knocking off about $300,000 a month of our drilling and completion costs with 6 rigs on biofuel. So there's a number of things that we're doing there that program drilling really allows us to do and take full advantage of.","Thomas E. Jorden","Jeff, one thing that we talk about, everybody in the industry's aware of this, when you go to a more liquids-rich program, it doesn't necessarily show up in an Mcf equivalent rate, but it sure shows up on returns. And when we look at Cana core, our -- we haven't talked a lot about Cana deep results, but we have good results. I mean we had, on average, with 19 wells we drilled, 15 of them operated that are currently on line, we were averaging 4 to 5 million cubic feet a day held flat on a slowback for 3 months or more. We're slowbacking those wells, choking them back to try to manage that downhaul reservoir pressure. So they were very, very nice wells. The problem with it is that it's methane. There's almost no liquids uplift there. So as we go to the core, we're seeing kind of comparable rates, but we're also seeing yields of anywhere from 10 to 35 barrels of condensate per million, condensate that is trucked off as oil, and then anywhere from 86 to 111 barrels of natural gas liquids per million. So the rates on an Mcfe basis don't necessarily show the difference in the return. And so it's much more capital-efficient.","Joseph R. Albi","But that really surfaces -- this is Joe, that really surfaces in the Permian program, too. We're directing more capital into an oil and liquids-rich area down there, and it's the same deal. An Mcfe in the Permian is not like an Mcfe in a dry gas area.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then last question, on your -- do you have any material acreage dollars in the 2012, $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion capital number?","Thomas E. Jorden","We do. I will say, in 2011, for us, we spent a lot of money on acreage. We spent actually about $189 million on acreage in 2011. And that's, for us, at 15% of capital or a little less than that. That's a pretty aggressive year for acreage. We would like to do that or close to that this year. Mark's looking at the numbers. What do you have modeling?","Mark Burford","It's about $140 million for this year.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes. And so what will happen there, a lot of that 2011 was our pushing to Cana deep. We spent a lot of money putting the Cana deep position together. We would like to see a very aggressive acreage year, Mark's carrying $140 million, and I would say, I would expect the lion's share of that to be Permian and other new ventures. And new ventures could be Anadarko Basin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a couple of questions for you. In the Permian, can you talk a little bit more about what changed in the Bone Springs wells that you've been drilling relative to the 3Q call and the results that you've seen?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, yes, this is Tom, mister dour from the Q3 call. The thing that I -- Chris, we never get a do-over in life. But one of the things I will say is even in the Q3 call, our returns in our Permian were very good. And I probably should have stressed that a little more. It was our actual results to our expected results. And so what changed is our teams really tore into that. We did a lot of petrophysical work, some geochemical work, and identified some more subtle trends that we had -- kind of we've been kind of drilling our way into and we really tore the wells apart, built some water saturation models. The operations group did a great job of getting some saltwater disposal in place that will allow us to make money moving this water instead of hauling it and really drilled some nice wells. We are not here today talking about individual wells, but I will say, we did drill some wells in the fourth quarter that averaged, for first 30 days, averaged over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And that's through that science, we moved into some areas that we think are just better. So that said, we upsized our fracs. We had some nice results in the Wolfcamp once we completed our wells. So there were so material changes in our program. I mean we're always focused on getting better at the business, and in the third quarter, you kind of caught us in the middle of it. And I will say, today, we are better at the business.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's great. And if we look at the Permian overall, I know you talked about the line that you installed there down the Culberson County. From an infrastructure point of view, do you see any potential bottlenecks on the system anywhere in the basin? And if so, what regions do you think are going to be tightest, both for you, and I guess, for industry in general?","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe, Ryan. We've put in about -- I think at the end of the year we had over 67 miles of infrastructure, mostly pipeline in place in the Permian. Our goal was simply to control our infrastructure, obviously, and give us some market optionality. We're worried about takeaway capacity on the Permian as I know all of our competitors are. We've put in our own tap into an El Paso line that we will be JTing our own production. That gives us a little bit of a reservation, if you -- capacity, if you want to call it that. And we're also working with the likes of, I won't name names, but other processors to understand what they have coming around the corner in the area and what capacities they currently have to try to ensure to the degree that we can that our volumes are moving. We see the El Paso tap as kind of being our safety net where we may not get as a good recovery out of our JT, but we certainly will be able to move the gas.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And I mean I know trucks were -- at one point early in 2011, there was kind of tightness in trucking and then had loosened up. Does that kind of remain not much of a concern these days, or is that still a concern as well?","Thomas E. Jorden","I want to give kudos to our marketing and operations guys who've done a great job there. We find ourselves up with a couple of purchasers, where there's scorecards in place, certain processes in place to ensure trucks are available. We've put a deal together for the piping of some oil out of the West Texas area with some commitments on their part, to the hauler's part and ours, that we will both perform. That has certainly helped. And that really picked up in Q4. We had a little bit of a problem with the weather in December, and then we made all that back up just tremendously here in January. So the guys have done a great job there.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. Then one more, if I could, on Cana. The range that we see in the production guidance for 2012, is that primarily driven by potential for flexibility around that Cana program? And if you decide not to go forward with kind of the next leg of drilling there, pad drilling in Cana, does that take production to the low-end of the guidance range or how should we think about that?","Joseph R. Albi","We've built out around the current 10-rig program. So to the extent we accelerate or decelerate, it would affect those numbers. But if we decelerate, as Tom mentioned, we'll be moving that capital elsewhere.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes. And because of the delay on those completions, that really would not impact 2012 significantly.","Paul Korus","And more impact...","Thomas E. Jorden","In 2013, right. If we were to keep going, almost by the middle of third quarter, anything we do from then out shows some 2013 production just because of the -- there's a natural delay when you drill these wells side by side. You have to get a certain bank of them drilled before you complete them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Allman with JPMorgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So just to clarify and following up with Ryan's first question, so what is it that explains the higher IP rates on average for both the Wolfcamp and the Bone Spring from the third quarter to the fourth quarter? I mean, is it geography? I mean, did you just drill in different locations where you got better rock or is it more fracs or longer laterals? I mean what is it really?","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, well it's -- there are -- that's 2 different areas and there's 2 different answers. In the second Bone Spring, it's -- a lot of its geography, we, through our analysis of the petrophysics, stayed out of some of the higher water-cut areas. We also upsized our completions. And so that -- some of it is geography, targeting what we saw as richer areas, and some of it is upsizing our completions. So it's a combination of both. In the Wolfcamp, some of it's just the real estate. I mean we're drilling our way through and we've tried targeting a couple of different stratigraphic intervals. One of the things that we see in that Wolfcamp play is -- and we talked about this in the very beginning. We don't understand the variation until we get out there and drill it. There's not a lot of wells to key off on, where we have mud logs. And so one of the big variables is going to be yield, how much condensate are you going to make, what's the natural gas liquids yield. And so we're out there drilling and testing the area, and we're finding that, I think, we're identifying a couple of sweet spots out there. So, Joe, it's kind of a combination of both, operational efficiencies and real estate.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And so in the third quarter, when you talked about different issues, you talked about, I think, some lower EURs than you previously have modeled. I think you talked about water handling and that caused the cost to go up. I think more water than you had modeled. And then you just talked about general cost pressures. So could you just address those issues and do you see all of them resolved, or which ones do you see resolved and which ones are still unresolved?","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes. The water issue is -- if you drill into an area with high water cut, you're going to make water. I mean if somebody has a way to fall -- fix that, give me a call. But you can mitigate it by saltwater disposal. And in the third quarter call, we were in a situation where we're paying at times, $4 a barrel to haul water and that could just kill your economics. So we've gotten saltwater disposal wells in, and we've also, by this petrophysical work we've done and working with our operations group, have a plan in place where we can go in and target these high water cut areas, but have a disposal well ready so we're flowing back into a saltwater disposal well. But I'm looking at a -- right as I answer your question, I'm looking at kind of a highlights reel of the fourth quarter in that second Bone Spring. And I will say that our water cuts vary from 29% upwards of 65%. So even at 65% water cut, you can make a nice living if you can dispose that water efficiently. So I wouldn't say we've solved the water issue and that we're still going to make a fair amount of water in that play, but we've done a lot in terms of fixing the economics of it.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of service cost pressures, I think on the third quarter call, you talked about service cost pressures especially in the Permian. And if I'm hearing you correctly today, you're talking about costs going the other way in the Permian.","Joseph R. Albi","Yes, that's a tricky question. This is Joe. With regard to fracs, the frac has a number of components. You've got your service costs, and that can be affected by the cost of their personnel,  number one, and to some degree, our efficiencies in getting a job pumped. If it takes us less time to pump a job, the service cost is less. On the service cost side, we have seen the per unit cost go down. You've got the other 2 ingredients. You've got fluids, and those can vary by the degree to which we use more fluid and the type of fluid that we use. And then on the prop side, what type of prop do we use? We've worked very hard to use white sand where we can, and for the most part are using it in virtually all of our operations. That's helped cut our cost down on the prop side. But if we run more stages, we're going to run more -- we're going to pump more prop and more fluid. So overall, I'd say, as a company, that quarter-to-quarter, we've seen our overall total company service costs go down. And the fluid and prop costs are probably in that flattish range as a result of how we may or may not have changed our program design.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And Joe, just speaking specifically to the Permian, so you're seeing the, that overall costs go down there as well?","Joseph R. Albi","Yes, right now, it's starting to soften on the service side. The biggest controlling factor there is do we pump x number of stages or y, with y being more than x, the total volumes pumped. I want to elaborate a little bit too on what Tom said about the SWD issue and how that affects not only our lifting costs, but the economics of these wells and particularly, the Permian. We really got going on that, I'd say, in late Q3. Some of the results of those SWD projects we'll see in our lifting costs being reduced from current levels on the SWD side. But our real goal is to get out ahead of this thing so that those costs never even hit the books and that we're paying virtually little, if any, dollars to dispose of any of the produced load water that we see from our new wells. We have identified, at the end of the year, 17 different SWD projects that entail about $40 million worth of capital that we're trying to undertake that hopefully we'll have done here before the end of the year. Some of them have already been completed. But we're really emphasizing that, and that is really having an impact in our overall rate of return in the Permian, number one, and that, number two, we hope to have it show up in our lifting cost.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, Joe, this is Tom, and we -- you know us well. I mean we'd rather talk about results than promise, and we're really happy to be here this morning talking about real results. We haven't had our last problem solved. We're a blocking and tackling outfit. We try to do good science, be good at the business, but we certainly like where our Permian and Mid-Continent assets are sitting right now. We're having really good results. And I think that the program we've outlined here today has a great promise to deliver those results. And another thing that we're really pleased to report to you is we have flexibility. If there's ever a time in our business where I've looked out at the future and thought that the boundaries are broader than I've ever see. In terms of up and downside of people's forecast, we have flexibility, so to be able to react, to run for daylight or pull in a little bit, depending on market conditions. So we'll continue, hopefully, to report good results, but we've had some very, very nice results in both the Permian and our Mid-Continent programs.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's helpful. And just one more, and I think this is for Joe. So, Joe, In the Gulf Coast, basically, your guidance is suggesting that you're going to be down about 50% from the fourth quarter production level to the average of 2012. So that's all that midyear. Is that -- are you guys just being conservative with that?","Joseph R. Albi","Well, Joe, we've got -- we're always fighting some of the same old things with mechanical issues or sand flow or what have you. But what I have attempted to do, both approaching it from 2 different angles, is look at potential risked contribution from new wells without a lot of mechanical issues. And what is that number for Q4, what is it if you just assume nothing and, from the new wells drilled and no mechanical issues, and we still come around that same darn level that we've quoted in our press release. So I really don't know how to say any more than that.","Paul Korus","It's our best estimate.","Joseph R. Albi","[indiscernible] Yes.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Anyway, but I guess it's interesting that the production, even though you've -- it would seem to me that you've gone through the steepest part of the decline and the decline would lessen, that the number suggested is going to be down 50%. And that's 50% from fourth quarter to maybe midyear.","Joseph R. Albi","Yes, that's what we're modeling. Most of that solved the Beaumont stuff. And we've got some assets that are fairly longer live. I guess you want to call that for the Gulf Coast that eventually, that will tail off and that decline won't be as severe. But in our minds, the point of the matter is, hey, it's less than 6% of our total production in 2012.","Operator","Gentlemen, do you have any closing remarks?","Mark Burford","Oh, yes. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Appreciate everyone's participation in the call, and we look to continue to report good results in the future. If you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to give us a call. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would like to now turn the conference over to Karen Acierno. Please go ahead.","Karen Acierno","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. An updated presentation was posted to our website yesterday afternoon, and we will be referring to this presentation during the call today. Just a reminder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements, a number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements on our news release and in our 10-Q which we filed today, and our latest 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the risk factors associated with our business.","We will begin our prepared remarks with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden. As John Lambuth is unavailable this morning, Tom will also update you on our drilling activities and results. And then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on operations, including production and well costs. Mark Bradford, our CFO, is also here to help answer any questions. As always, so that we can accommodate more of your questions during the hour we have allotted for the call, we'd like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, and then feel free to get back in the queue if you like.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Jorden","Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Cimarex is off to a good start in 2019. We closed the Resolute Energy transaction on Friday, March 1. By Sunday, March 3, we had a completion crew on location at the Sandlot development. And on March 8, we closed on the issuance of $500 million in senior note that essentially refinanced Resolute notes at a much more attractive interest rate, 4.38% versus the 8.5% previously being paid. 2019 will be a year dominated by development projects as we capitalize on the work we have done in the past few years in understanding optimum development of each area and each reservoir. I will walk you through some of the projects we're developing in 2019, but first, I would like to take a minute to describe our approach to optimum economic development. I will be referring to Slide 6 and 7 in our updated presentation.","Our goal is to maximize the value of our assets. And as we have said in the past, optimum well spacing is not a one size fits all solution. Optimum economics development involves four key components: one, understanding fracture geometry and cluster efficiency; two, understanding parent-child interference; three, understanding the details of well spacing and well-to-well interference; and four, understanding the governing factors of optimal project size which includes total capital investment, including infrastructure, as well as the impact that project size has on project timing.","Slide 6 and 7 illustrate our methodology on choosing optimum well spacing, which is only one of the four key criteria. Often, well spacing gets confused with parent-child interference; they are two different but related phenomenon. These data, which are an outgrowth of many detailed experiments, are actual examples from two different well spacing projects. Together, they illustrate the economic sensitivity of adding additional wells to a development project. Too many wells can quickly become value destroying, too few wells can leave value untapped.","As the slides illustrate, we believe that the economic sweet-spot is found somewhere between maximizing rate of return and maximizing net present value. These principles underpin all of the development projects we'll be discussing today. Understanding these nuances for every reservoir and for every area are key to Cimarex development decisions. We have a great team at work here, and we strive to make prudent decisions based upon sound science in order to maximize the value of our assets. Details count here; getting it right is the difference between value creation and value destruction.","Finally, I want to highlight an additional slide in our updated presentation that illustrates the tremendous quality of our Culberson County asset. We have long described the outstanding returns we deliver with our extended length horizontal wells in Culberson County. We have also discussed the fact that these wells exhibit lower-than-normal oil decline, primarily driven by the energy in these over-pressured reservoirs, and the fact that the reservoir phase has tremendous mobility. Referring to Slide 15; it may surprise you to learn that Culberson County surpasses all other counties in the Delaware Basin in cumulative oil production. Slide 15 shows a Delaware Basin breakdown by county, of 6, 12 and 18-month cumulative oil production. This slide is built from public data using all wells since 2016 with lateral lengths greater than 8,500 feet in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring formation. We have not applied any filter other than lateral length, date of first production information; each of you should be able to recreate these graphs on your own.","Furthermore, the Culberson wells produced with lower lease operating expense due to the fact they do not require artificial lift until later in their lives; high returns, low LOE, basin-leading cumulative oil, it's a great trifecta. We're in a tough patch on residue gas prices. As we promised, we have flow assurance of our produced gas, but we are experiencing brutal Waha and Panhandle Eastern pricing. We do expect these differentials to NYMEX to soften as additional pipeline capacity opens up later this year. Nonetheless, our flow assurance gives us access to the liquids component of our gas stream, which is much more valuable than the residue gas. Residue gas is a minor component for our overall revenue stream. 2019 will be another year of solid execution; we're seeing the benefits of our emphasis on science and innovation, as well as our organizational capability and focus on return.","Now on to some operational highlights. During the first quarter, Cimarex invested $368 million in exploration development activities. We invested $319 million in drilling and completion capital. In 2019, we expect to spend between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of drilling completion capital, 85% of which is expected to be invested in the Permian region. We currently operate nine gross rigs, with eight in the Permian, and one in the Mid-Continent. I will start in the Permian region where we brought online twelve gross, five net wells in the first quarter. Although the net well count may seem low, activity was not. We had multiple development projects that were being completed during the first quarter, with much of the production coming online in the second quarter and beyond.","Four developments are now flowing back; that's our Sandlot, Capote, Brokers Tip and Sir Barton, and 17 of the 21 net wells expected to be on production in the Permian region during the second quarter are already online and flowing. One of these development projects is the 4-well Sandlot development located in Reeves County. This is the first development project to come online that is the direct result of our acquisition of Resolute Energy, with two more development projects on the acquired Resolute acreage to be drilled later this year. Two developments in Culberson County are also flowing back, the Brokers Tip and Sir Barton projects, both of which are 7-well developments located on the western half of our Culberson acreage position. You can see these on Slide 13 in our updated presentation.","We are watching these particular developments very carefully because the number of the wells were landed higher up in the section in the Upper Wolfcamp section in the X and Y sands. Results from these projects could influence our future spacing on this acreage position. Although we don't have any developments planned in the Lower Wolfcamp for 2019, the Animal Kingdom pilot, which has now been online for over 6 months, is providing critical information that will guide our development plans in the future for the Lower Wolfcamp. As you can see on Slide 27 in the appendix to our presentation, these wells have cumulative production of over 2.7 million BOE in their first 225 days; we are very pleased with the results of this project.","Now on to the Mid-Continent; in the first quarter, the Mid-Continent region brought online 26 gross, 3 net wells. The majority of the production for this region will come online in the second quarter as we complete 3 Meramec development projects; that being the Billy, the Wort, and the Miss Mary. The spacing for these projects varies from 3 to 5 wells per section. By the middle of May, the Mid-Continent region will release the one operated rig it has under contract. Wort continues to finalize the timing and capital plans for the next major development in the region, which will most likely be the Leota Jacobs project located in the liquids-rich part of the Woodford. The first wells in this project are currently scheduled to spud in late December.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph Albi","Well, thank you, Tom, and thank you all of you for joining us on our call today. I'll touch on the usual items, hitting first on our first quarter production, then hit on our Q2 and 2019 full year production guidance, and then finish up with a few comments on lease operating expense and service costs. We're off to a strong start here in 2019, with Q1 net equivalent production coming in at 259,000 BOEs per day. We beat the high-end of our guidance range of 245,000 to 257,000 and also set a new record for the company for equivalent production. With 8 net wells coming online during the quarter, our net equivalent production was up 3% over Q4 '18 and 26% over the first quarter of 2018.","On the oil side, our Q1 oil volume of 79,400 barrels per day came in 2% above our guidance midpoint, and was up 22% over our Q1 '18 posting of 65,000 barrels per day. The Permian drove that increase with our first quarter '19 Permian oil volume of 65,000 barrels a day, up over 30% over the 50,000 barrels a day we've produced in Q1 '18 in the Permian. Looking forward into 2019, we're reiterating our full year 2019 capital guidance and activity levels. That said, with the strong start to the year, we've modestly increased our full year equivalent and oil production projections. We've bumped our full year net equivalent production guidance to 260,000 to 275,000 BOEs per day; that's up 7,500 BOEs per day or 3% over our previous guidance that we gave last call. And we've also raised our full year net oil guidance to 80,000 to 88,000 barrels a day; that's up 1,000 barrels a day or 1% over the midpoint of our previous oil guidance.","For Q2, our model is projecting net equivalent volumes to average 263,000 to 275,000 BOEs per day and our net oil volumes to average 79,000 to 85,500 barrels of oil per day, both the equivalent and the oil up 4% quarter-over-quarter at their respective midpoints.","Shifting to our operating expense; our first quarter lifting costs came in at $3.31 per BOE, that's below the midpoint of our guidance range that we gave of $3.20 to $3.70, and it's down $0.31 per BOE from our 2018 average of $3.62. With the Resolute properties now on our books, we're maintaining our full year lifting cost guidance of $3.20 to $3.70 which also incorporates our continued Permian focus and the market pressures we've been seeing in cost items, such as SWD and compression.","And lastly, some comments on drilling and completion costs. On the drilling side, with the drilling cost components holding relatively stable since our last call, we're keeping the drilling portion of our AFEs in check. And on our completion AFEs, we're holding them flat as well, as we continue to focus on cost savings by challenging completion designs, utilizing local sand sources and through efficiency gains we've derived from water recycling and zipper fracking. And as a result, we're maintaining the total well cost estimates that we mentioned last call in our Wolfcamp program. Depending on area, interval, facility design and frac logistics, our current Wolfcamp 2-mile AFEs are running $10.4 million to $12.9 million. That's down $0.5 million from the estimates that we quoted late last year.","With the efficiency gains that we're deriving through multi-well development drilling, the average crude well cost that we've seen in our Wolfcamp development projects are falling well in that low end of that range. And in the Mid-Continent, with our refined completion design and local sand pricing, we're holding our 2-mile Meramec AFE range at $10 million to $11.5 million. Again, that's down about $0.5 million from late 2018 and more than $1.5 million lower than the total well cost that we quoted about a year ago.","So in closing, we're coming off a great quarter with our net oil and equivalent volumes beating the midpoints of our model. With the strong start, we're projecting continued production growth into Q2, and we've raised our full year guidance ranges for both equivalent volumes and for oil. And with our healthy overall cost structure, we're well positioned to deliver the capital, activity and production plan that we put in place at the beginning of the year.","So with that, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Gabe Daoud with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Gabriel Daoud","Good morning, Tom; good morning, everyone. I was hoping we could start with Permian pricing maybe. You've provided us with a cash flow sensitivity for a couple of different oil price scenarios. Was just curious what happens to cash flow this year if gas prices were to remain at or below 0 until Gulf Coast Express comes on later this year? And then on oil, are you guys seeing any API gravity deducts anywhere across the asset base?","Mark Burford","Gabe, this is Mark. Yes, if you look at Permian cash flow, if the gas prices averaged 0 for the second -- or the second and third quarter and taking account our hedge position of about 35% of our gas hedging in the Permian, our net cash flow impact is somewhere in the $30 million impact to our annual cash flow.","Gabriel Daoud","Great, that's helpful. And then I guess just as a follow-up at the asset level, could you just maybe talk a little bit about Mid-Con, 1Q down quarter-over-quarter, obviously not a ton of activity. But maybe could you just give us a sense of when that asset does receive more operator activity? At what, I guess, commodity price would incentivize more activity on that asset?","Thomas Jorden","Well, we're certainly looking seriously at additional development projects on that West side liquids-rich window. I mentioned that Leota Jacobs is one that's seriously being contemplated to spud later this year. We're also looking at a number of projects in that Lone Rock area that really compete with anything in our portfolio. But certainly, we've been asked about our relative investment in the Mid-Continent versus Permian. We'd like to see that be a little more balanced, and our Mid-Continent team is hard at work looking for new opportunities and trying to compete for capital. I'll say this, we really like the Mid-Continent. If you asked me what I would look for in a U.S. basin, I would say I'd look for a multi-pay basin, over-pressured in a fairly friendly business regulatory environment. And certainly I've just described the Permian basin, but I've also described the Delaware Basin.","And so we've got our team hard at work looking for new opportunities -- I'm sorry, Anadarko Basin. We've got our team hard at work looking for new opportunities and it doesn't -- it's all held by production. So we're really at a point where we are working on new zones, new targets. And we really hope to be discussing some things in the future.","Gabriel Daoud","And just to follow-up on the API gravity question, please, if I may. Thanks again.","Joseph Albi","This is Joe, I can handle that for now. We've seen a few price deducts in our Permian production here in March and in April. It basically impacts about 20% to 23% of our total gross production, which, as we net it down, might equate to about 15,000 barrels a day of our net production, and annualized for the year would impact us to the tune of only $7 million. So that's what we've seen today. Part of that includes the addition of the Resolute properties, which are deducted right after we bought it.","Gabriel Daoud","Understood , thanks again, guys.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeanine Wai","Good morning everyone. Just wanted to follow up just as second here on Gabe's question on the oil pricing. I believe historically, for Cimarex, Culberson County has had the highest API and Lea County had the lowest, but I think I'm a little stale on that, so I'm not sure if anything has changed over the past couple of years. And so if this is a potential scenario for Cimarex, kind of what steps can you take to mitigate some of the negative deducts for oil pricing? Is there something maybe contractually that you're looking to go after? Or is there something about pipes or anything about going after different formations? Just what kind of levers you can pull to kind of counteract some negative pricing?","Joseph Albi","This is Joe. I'll take a stab at that. Obviously, renegotiating some of the contracts is certainly in the mix. There are certain positives on both sides of the contracts that -- negatives, likewise, for each party. And to that extent, without going any deeper into that, it's something we'll look at. The other thing we're looking at is the -- trying to get these oil directly sold at the Gulf Coast. And that's more of a long-term perspective that we're taking on right now, not just here but also in the Mid-Continent where we see gravity issues being a potential risk.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great, thank you for taking my question.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning. And by the way, I just wanted to say how much I appreciate the additional disclosure that you've shown at the slides. It's really helpful. Tom, you mentioned Wolfcamp XY tests that could influence future development. I just wondered, was the point here that you're testing zone communication between the XY and the Upper Wolfcamp? Or did you make something else?","Thomas Jorden","Well, no. The Wolfcamp is a petroleum system. And so understanding the individual zones within that system that can contribute is really important. One of the things that we've seen with individual wells is those X and Y sands can have great deliverability. And they're probably not going to be in new independent landing zone, but it may allow us to get more wells per section through a stack stagger arrangement. It also speaks directly to deliverability. Their deliverability at wells that land in those targets, we are hopeful, will be an uplift over our primary Upper Wolfcamp target. So anytime you have, let's say, 600, 700 feet of productive reservoir, the more landing zones you have available to you, the more flexibility you have in your spacing.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, thank you for that color. My other question is on Slide 17; I thought the little illustration on the frac generation was quite interesting. And what really stuck out to me is that Gen 4 behaves very differently than the other 3 generations. It's faster out of the gate and then stays that way, where some of the others may start faster but decline or start slower and rise. So I was just wondering if you could just give any color on what's going on there to make that different behavior in Gen 4.","Thomas Jorden","Well, obviously, what you'd like to see is curves that are up to the left and straight lines and -- because that shows not only higher productivity but the degree of linearity shows low decline. When they bend over, those wells are declining. Now this Gen 4, there is a limiting factor in that reservoir resource and play. So at some point, they will bend over. But what we're hoping to see is maximum amount of time in that straight-line behavior because that speaks directly to return on our investment. So that's a wonderful outcome, but that's not going to be straight up until forever, it's going to bend over.","Jeffrey Campbell","Understood. Okay, thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Scialla with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael Scialla","Good morning everybody. You have resisted entering any firm transport contracts for Permian oil in the past, and that decision looks like it's probably a good one. Wanted to see if you have any thoughts on potentially taking firm transport on natural gas out of the basin given your outlook for that commodity long term.","Thomas Jorden","Well, I'll take a stab at that and then turn it over to Joe. That -- firm on natural gas is one of the things that we're seriously discussing. And although we typically resist firm because of the -- you're really committing to future capital investment, we think about residue gas a little differently than our other bases. Because firm transport on residue gas is really insurance against your oil revenue. In particular, if we get into a flaring situation, it's anybody's guess what that looks like long term. So we are discussing some firm transport on pipelines out of the basin. We're in pretty good shape in the short run with our marketing arrangement. But in the long run, I think you'd find our thinking is evolving on firm with regards to gas. Joe, you want to comment on that.","Joseph Albi","Yes. I'd just echo a lot of what Tom said. As far as our strategy today, it's been to line ourselves up with suppliers and shippers with firm on pipe out of the basin. And with each and every quarter, we continue to extend the contracts that we're putting into place. We're nearly 100% through the first quarter of 2020 and have upwards of 75% to 80% of all of our residue gas already sold through October 2020. But we are also looking at, as Tom said, to a longer-term strategy to firm up a portion of our volumes on pipe directly to the goal. I might add that, years back, we put together an arrangement with Cheniere on the Cheniere pipeline to do the same coming out of the Anadarko Basin with really no obligation to commit to any volumes until 2020, 2021. And so we've done it before, and it's something that we certainly are still looking at.","Michael Scialla","And then looking at your Slide 27; Tom, you mentioned the Animal Kingdom had, it looks like, some really strong rates from those wells. I assume that, I guess, one that makes you feel pretty comfortable about 14 wells per section in the Lower Wolfcamp in that area. But I was also thinking, how do you think about developing the Lower Wolfcamp? I know you've shown better returns and a higher oil cut in the Wolfcamp A in Culberson. When you think about that -- those criteria that you talked about to maximize value on Slide 6 and 7, wanted to see how you develop the Lower Wolfcamp. Can you develop it later? I mean can you develop the upper zones first and then leave the lower? Or do you need to do some sort of co-development?","Thomas Jorden","I'll take your second question first and then come back to your first question. The nice thing about Lower Wolfcamp is it is, as best we've been able to determine over years of analysis, completely isolated from the Upper Wolfcamp. We don't think there's fractured communication. There's no drainage, so that the Upper and Lower Wolfcamp can be treated as completely independent zones and one is not at the hostage of another on development timing. And that's a wonderful thing to be able to say as we look at that asset. . As far as spacing, Animal Kingdom was a success. That doesn't mean that we'll space it 14 wells per section. We like to watch these wells over time. We like to watch the GOR behavior over time. And 14 wells per section is an early success. But I would say it's probably going to land 12 to 14, but we want to watch these wells before we really pound the table. So far so good, excellent return on that project, we're very pleased with it. But we're not forced to make an early call on that, and we'd like to watch those wells.","Michael Scialla","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","Good morning. First question is a quick follow-up on a comment that you made earlier on with regards to the Mid-Continent. You indicated that your team is focused on finding additional opportunities for -- to compete for capital. Was that a comment on organic opportunities within the existing acreage position that you have? Or was that more of an inorganic -- pursuing inorganic opportunities, such as what you've recently done in the Permian?","Thomas Jorden","Well, opportunity is an opportunity. I don't care whether it's organic or inorganic, what I care about is the entry cost. And so organic opportunities, or we'll redevelop an idea and get in and lease it, typically has the lowest opportunity cost but also has the highest risk. But that's our business. And the Anadarko is great hunting ground. . And I don't want to give anybody the impression that there's some hinge thing coming in the Anadarko. But we get asked a lot about our capital allocation and I think it's a fair answer to say we're not pleased with it long term. We want to see a more robust allocation of capital. But right now, we're quite pleased with where our money is flowing. We think it's flowing appropriately. And it's a nice challenge for Anadarko team to come roaring back. I'll say this, and finishing my answer to your question, it hasn't always been this way. There were years when it was exactly the opposite, where the Permian was having a hard time competing for capital and the Anadarko is leading the charge. So we tend to take a little longer-term view on this than quarter-to-quarter, and it's going to work its way out.","Brian Singer","That's helpful color. And then my follow-up is with regards to the spacing in the Upper Wolfcamp and the Bone Spring relative to the schematics that you have on Slide 6. Would you say you're moving more as you try to seek here C case, which the optimal spacing? That you're moving more from A to C or moving more from B to C. And just kind of wondering how -- what we should expect from a well productivity perspective going forward.","Thomas Jorden","Well, we want to stay -- referring to the slides, where, for those of you that aren't looking at the slides, B is an example where the wells are greatly interfering. There's tremendous fracture overlap, and you've destroyed capital. So my easy answer is we want to stay as far away from B as we can. But our only point here is that many voices out there say you should maximize rate of return. And many voices out there say you should maximize PV-10. We don't think either one of those are very good rule. We think it's reservoir by reservoir. And in particular, you can't make the decision based on the cumulative total project. You really need to look at the incremental return on that last well drilled. Some reservoirs can be very forgiving. And if you drill a well or 2, you're going to be okay. You won't hurt yourself.","Other reservoirs, as illustrated on Slide 7, and this is a real-life example, a different example than the ones shown on Slide 6, some reservoirs are so sensitive that if you drill one extra well and push all of those wells closer together, that extra well you drilled absolutely destroyed capital. So we want to be somewhere between that maximum rate of return and that maximum present value, and it's going to be reservoir-by-reservoir and area-by-area dependent.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","John Abbott","Good morning, this is John Abbott on for Doug Leggate. First question is going back to Slide 6, just trying to get a little bit more color on this. So this 12 to 14 wells per section, how does that decision -- or in this particular example, how would that decision play out at a $50 oil deck, a $55 oil deck or a $60 oil deck? How would that cumulative, that analysis of PV versus return, changes as far as sections -- wells per section?","Thomas Jorden","Well, at different commodity prices, those curves are going to shift a little. Certainly, the rate of return is going to shift and the present value is going to shift. But the way it would play out, and we make this decision at every development project, it's a function of your understanding of your fracture geometry and how confident you are in these plots. And I just want to make a little plug for organization, they started working on this type of analysis a couple of years ago. And then after a lot of success internally, we turned them loose studying some competitor development projects. And in similar reservoirs, we asked them to predict the well-to-well interference for some of our competitors' projects, and they had a remarkable fidelity in looking at these analysis, and not only predicting our own well interference but also predicting some competitor well interference. But one of the things that this is also a function of is what does your inventory look like and what are your other opportunities available to you. And why do I say that?","Well, I say that because there are voices out there that are saying that on a graph like this, you should be at the point where you're maximizing PV-10. And although that's not a goofy statement, at Cimarex, we would roundly disagree with that. We would never seek to maximize PV-10 because, implicitly, that means that, that last well you drilled is at a 10% rate of return. And our history, our body of experience tells us that putting drilling capital in for an incremental 10% rate of return is a perilous decision. So we also generate, although we didn't illustrate this on this slide, when we do this internally, we will also show present value 20 and present value 30. Because those are rates of return or discount rates that allow us to make a better decision when comparing other opportunities on our portfolio for that capital. So, I know I gave you more detail than you asked for, but we really believe in these curves. They're grounded on a lot of science and years of experimentation. And we're pretty confident in our application of them.","John Abbott","That was very helpful. And then for the second question, what are your latest thoughts about potentially monetizing your midstream assets at some point?","Thomas Jorden","Well, we think about it all the time. We -- at some point, I think it would be appropriate for us to monetize our midstream asset. If we could find a midstream partner that would allow us to take the midstream capital off our balance sheet and give us the absolute outstanding service that we give ourselves, it would be a fairly easy decision. But that's -- a lot of moving parts on what I just said. And that includes run time, compression run time, our midstream assets, are we ready for peak production when it comes online? One of the things I've said for years is you can see Cimarex assets easily, all you have to do is overfly the Delaware Basin at night and you'll see the dark spot, and that's Cimarex surrounded by a lot of heavy flaring. Our midstream group really does a nice job minimizing our flaring, maximizing our run time. And everything I just said is also true for our water assets. Now I don't want to -- I will tell you we talk about this a lot, and I am sure that there will be a time when monetization makes sense. But right now, I will say the reason we own these asset is because it enhances the profitability of our production base. And as long as that's still true, we want to own them.","John Abbott","Thank you very much for taking our questions.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. please go ahead.","Neal Dingmann","Tom, I think you all have said when you look at sort of returns or top 10 returns that there is, I think you've mentioned in the past around $65 pretty well split up between the Permian and the Mid-Con. And when it gets down close to $55, it ends up weighted heavily more towards the Delaware. I'm just wondering, prices go back up and were not too far away from that, say, about the $65 and stayed there for a while, would you all consider reallocating more resources there or just adding more, as the prior question had asked, just adding more activity there in general?","Thomas Jorden","Well, we -- of course, this is very price-dependent. It's also oil versus natural gas price dependent, and NGL prices are a critical element as well. What we said is of our 10 type curves, our top 10 opportunity set, at typical prices, $55 to $65 band, typically 6 or 7 of our top 10 are Delaware Basin and 3 to 4 of our top 10 are Anadarko Basin. Now there's a lot of other considerations, not the least of which is repeatability, our confidence that we can invest and get the returns that we're targeting, and then our capital needs in a given year. And it just so happens in 2019, Anadarko has made great progress on a lot of fronts, including the Woodford, including the Meramec. Because we were living within cash flow, we just had a higher degree of confidence and decided to swing more of our capital into the Delaware Basin this year. But Anadarko is fighting back, and they're going make it hard for us to keep that true. And that's exactly what we want out of them.","Neal Dingmann","Okay, I have one follow-up. I'm wondering -- just maybe, Tom, for you or John, you haven't had the new Resolute asset too terribly long, but I'm just wondering, have you listed them and developed them long enough to have confidence in even more sort of multi-zone development, larger pad areas? Just talk about how you see potentially developing it and if anything's changed since you initially got those assets that time?","Thomas Jorden","Well, no. We're -- we understood those assets really well. That was right in our operating arena. We're thrilled to have those assets. We're very high on those assets. And as I said in remarks, we have a lot of activity planned on those in 2019. The only thing that's changed from when we did the deal is oil prices went down at the end of the year. We made a commitment to live firmly within cash flow and generate free cash flow this year. And I just want to remind everybody that Resolute was on a pretty screaming outspend. And so folding those in and having a combined discipline meant that we're probably doing a little less on that than we would have said in October, November last fall. But that's a decision we made. That was the right decision for Cimarex. And those assets are going to be a great contributing piece to our portfolio in 2019 and beyond.","Neal Dingmann","That's a great add. Thanks so much, Tom.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Hall","Good morning, thanks for the time. I guess maybe just following up on the questions on Resolute. I was just curious just where we stand on that asset from a volume current standpoint and maybe give us some color about or some confidence in the trajectory of the oil volumes here heading into the second quarter. And when you close the Resolute, volumes were quite a bit lower than at the time of the announcement. And as you said, you're reining back the outspend. Have those assets kind of tapered off on their declines yet? And yes -- and just what sort of early data can you provide us as it relates to trajectory here in the second quarter?","Thomas Jorden","Well, let me just give you an intro, and then Joe will make a few comments. One of the other things that happened in the transition period once we got anti-trust approval, we were able to get a little more conversational on operations. And we had some information that Resolute did not have. I think it's fairly widely understood that Resolute was drilling wells that we think were spaced much too close together. And I'll also share with you that we had a different interpretation on what that meant than Resolute did. You have multiple landing zones, and so there's always an issue where you need to understand is your interference from landing zone to landing zone or top to bottom, or is it side to side because of your core well-to-well spacing.","And so in the first quarter, we -- sort of by mutual agreement, Resolute sort of stood down a lot of their activity. They released their drilling rigs and they decided not to complete some wells and leave them for Cimarex to complete. That was a decision that we participated in and it was the absolute right decision for those assets. So I know some people were a little surprised that maybe that -- as that oil production declined a little more than they were anticipating, I just want to tell you that, that was a design consequence, not a surprise. And Joe, you want to say anything?","Joseph Albi","Yes. The only thing I'll add is that internally, the minute we put those assets into our shop, they were Cimarex assets. And so we haven't divided up our model or our database in any way, shape or form to say, \"Okay, here's this group of properties or that group of properties.\" Right now, it's all Cimarex. So whatever decline the properties are owned, they're all built into the production guidance that we're giving you guys.","Michael Hall","Okay, that's helpful. And just to be clear, I think I heard in the comments, but just want to confirm, I think you said 17 of the 30 wells to sales this quarter are already flowing back, is that right?","Joseph Albi","And we got -- of the Permian wells, 17 of the 21 projected Q2 wells are online. And when drilling the Mid-Continent, we've got 21 out of the total 30 wells that we're projecting for Q2 already online. I know Karen has gotten some questions about the midpoint increase Q2 over Q1. And the other thing I'd reiterate there, and particularly on the oil, is that of the 319-some-odd million that I think we put in our press release, about 70% plus of that is capital associated with the production that's going to come on Q2, 3 or 4. And most of that production is coming on here in May. So April should have been -- should be pretty flat to Q1 with our increase for Q2 starting midyear.","Michael Hall","Okay, that's super helpful. And then one other just on the Animal Kingdom pilot; how would you say those Lower Culberson -- or Lower Wolfcamp wells and Culberson compete with the activity set or opportunity set in Reeves? Just curious.","Thomas Jorden","Well, if I had to rank our type curves, certainly the Upper Wolfcamp is going to be below that Lower Wolfcamp at current pricing situation. So the Upper Reeves is Upper Wolfcamp. So if you asked me to rank Upper Wolfcamp -- Culberson, Upper Wolfcamp, Reeves or Lower Wolfcamp, Culberson -- it's going to be 1, 2, 3 in that order. They generate very good returns, but they're a little lower yield. And thus, at current commodity pricing, they're third in line with those 3.","Michael Hall","Okay, that's helpful, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul [ph] with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","The 2019 management incentives now include grow assets in the strategic section with removal of A and D focus from the tactical section. Given the completion of Resolute and your comment earlier on the entry costs for new plays, how should we consider exploration in the scope of 2019 and beyond for Cimarex?","Thomas Jorden","Well, you should consider exploration to be part of our DNA and something that we are unrelentingly focused on. If John were here, he would be quick to tell you that I beat on him mercilessly on this subject. And we've got a very good team there. But the challenge is high because we've also got this wonderful deep inventory. So it's a bit of a contradiction to say, \"Wow, we have this great inventory, but we always want to be on the hunt for new asset.\" But that's absolutely the truth. Two reasons. We'd love to find assets that would supplant things in our current portfolio, but just that constant hunt really makes us better as a geoscience organization. And so we would love to find something. I mean many of you are aware, we've talked that we do have a position in Louisiana Chalk. We had that position in Kentucky a few years ago. These were meaningful positions that we got in the low-entry cost.","I'm disappointed to tell you that we may never have a lot of production to report. But you know what, it was a low-entry cost. One of these is going to work and we're going to keep hunting. It's just what we do and, quite frankly, it's what we're good at as an organization.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood, makes sense. And I guess coming back towards the Permian on the follow-up. Could you provide more color on Culberson? And you mentioned it was over-pressured. Is that simply what's driving kind of the continued performance? Is there rock characteristics that vary in there and are more unique to that region? Would be curious of anything else you can share in more detail there.","Thomas Jorden","Well, Culberson -- Culberson is unbelievable. I mean I don't want to be promotional on that, but it is tremendous asset. And I hope that many of you were surprised to see the Culberson County by 18 months of production is the number one oil cume on average in the basin. And what's driving that -- there's Culberson County, and I'm talking Upper Wolfcamp now, is either retrograde condensate of oil to oil in the reservoir, tremendous mobility in that phase and with our 2-mile horizontal wells. So it's not just the rocks, it's that our asset and our acreage is configured to drill long horizontal wells without regard to the least one. So if you look at our average lateral length in Culberson County, it's about 10,000 feet. I mean every single well we're drilling is 2 miles long. And so you get that 2-mile long well, you got all of the feed-in from an effective fracture network, you have the mobility in the reservoir and it's a lower decline in that oil.","And then the other thing that is just as important to point as that cumulative oil is if we were to do a lease -- an LOE or lifting cost analysis county by county, we haven't done that and we should probably do that, but Culberson County -- I would be surprised if Culberson County weren't the lowest lifting cost in the basin because we don't have to put these wells on artificial lift. We also have a tremendous saltwater disposal network there. Our operations team has really built a smart asset. So a lot of things that have come together in Culberson County. Just a jewel for us. But the rocks are primary there. The -- it produces a lot of gas. And from time to time, I think people have discounted Culberson County because of its gas production. But the gas production, the energy in that reservoir and the mobility is wide. It's the number one oil-producing county in -- on average in the basin.","Unidentified Analyst","That's very, very helpful color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noel Parks with Coker Palmer. Please go ahead.","Noel Parks","Good morning. I wanted to touch back a little bit on saltwater disposal. And just as a reality check, you mentioned in your slides that you have a new agreement in Lea County. So could you sort of contrast your own internal water disposal cost versus, I guess, what the market bears for third-party water disposal services. Just give us a sense of the difference.","Joseph Albi","Bill, I'll take a stab at that. It's not just a quick and easy answer. Because when you put the infrastructure in place, we're spending capital dollars that once we've spend them, we're done and then it just becomes operating expenses. Where we find that there's efficiencies to do that or we have large acreage positions, such as -- altogether, such as in Triple Crown or in Matterhorn. As we get into New Mexico, where we don't have this contiguous leasehold position, we may not have the means to create those efficiencies by virtue of the capital dollars spent for very new wells that might be able to be tied into it. We're seeing, over the last couple of years, there's a number of saltwater disposal service providers in that area that have created a fairly competitive arena for us to have them tie to our wells and put together contracts by which we can dispose into their systems as well as take up out systems water for recycling to create the same efficiencies that we're seeing in Triple Crown and Matterhorn with regard to water recycling for our completion. We may pay upwards of $0.55 to $0.85 per barrel to get into some of those systems in those areas.","And again, it's all a matter of who's up there and how much pipe's up there and how competitive the market is. But the overall operating cost of the system we've already put capital into will be much lower than that. And we're building into a return of a capital on all the rates, they're going to charge you any way.","Thomas Jorden","It's not just the disposal, but it's also the ability to reuse the water. And we've struck some creative agreements with third-party providers in New Mexico and in certain parts of Texas, where we have the ability to essentially buy back some of that produced water and reuse it in frac operation. . But the beauty of our Culberson County, and what Joe said, Matterhorn, that's our Reeves County system. What the beauty of those 2 systems is that we've designed those with this reuse of produced water in mind. And so as shown in Slide 16, there's a picture of a saltwater system, a riser coming out where we can tap into this produced water system and divert it to a frac crew and use that water for fracking. And that's given us tremendous savings in our water. So there's a lot of moving parts. We're not here telling you that there can be places where third-party solutions are a better solution. And what Joe said, Eddy and Lea County are often that. But we're pretty efficient from a capital standpoint where we're controlling and owning these assets.","Noel Parks","And then for another question; just wondering in your northernmost Lea County acreage, I think you've done a little bit of drilling to the Wolfcamp B up there. Just wondering, do you have any plans up there or any update on anything you've recently done?","Thomas Jorden","Well, that's an area that's more exploratory. It's a little deeper formation than what produces elsewhere in the basin. We've tried 2 or 3 wells up there with okay results. I don't think it's going to be something that we're going to do a lot more drilling on in the near term. But that's an example of, going back to the prior question, it was -- it's really clever idea, we were -- we're really glad to try it, but it's probably not going to turn into a new program that will make -- investors like.","Noel Parks","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","Thanks for letting me back in. I just noticed that no one has discussed the upper provision to production in full year '19. I just wanted to ask you what was the primary variables or variable that supported that upgrade?","Joseph Albi","This is Joe. I'll take an easy stab at that. It's primarily acceleration in the timing of our Permian completion. You saw a little bit of that in Q1. And when we put together our 2 frac fleet schedule and revisited the timing of our completions, it's accelerated not only Q1 but we saw that in Q2 all through the year. So it's basically pulling production up within the quarters but not necessarily changing the well count that we have projected at the beginning of the year.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, great. That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Jorden for any closing remarks.","Thomas Jorden","Yes, thank you. Just in closing, I want to say we're very excited about our current performance. Very confident that our organization will execute and deliver on what we promised. And in closing, I really want to thank everybody on the call. We've had some good questions, some pertinent questions and focusing on issues that we think are good to discuss. I hope we've given you complete and thorough answers, and we always look forward to good discussions about Cimarex. So thank you very, very much.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. And please note, this event is being recorded.","Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Karen Acierno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.","Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today's prepared remarks will begin with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on our drilling activities and results from John Lambuth, EVP of Exploration, and then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on our operations, including production and well costs. Our CFO, Mark Burford, is also present to help answer any questions.","Yesterday afternoon we posted an updated presentation to our website. We may be referring to this presentation during our call today. As a remainder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business.","So that we can accommodate more of your questions during the hour we have allotted for the call, we'd like to once again ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Feel free to get back in the queue if you like.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you, Karen, and thanks to everyone who's participating in today's conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest and look forward to your questions during the question-and-answer portion of the call. On the call today, John will walk us through our recent results and describe our progress on of the delineation projects that we have underway, and then Joe will follow John with a detailed operational overview.","For the first time in a long time, our production came in below guidance. We averaged 947 million cubic feet equivalent per day in the third quarter, slightly below our guidance of 950 million to 980 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We expected the third quarter to represent the low point in our production for the year. However, we face delays in our completion owing in large part to the timing effect of our upside stimulations. We did not properly plan for the significant impact for setting in offset wells during completion operations, nor did we fully account for the 7 million cubic feet equivalent lost to higher ethane rejection.","The combined effect of these factors caused us not only to miss on the third quarter, but to bring down the fourth quarter outlook as well. We don't like to miss our forecasts on any of these items, and quite frankly, we need to do better.","I think it's worthwhile to put the delay in our production trajectory into context. Cimarex responded swiftly and deliberately to the downdraft in commodity prices that reached its nadir in February of this year. In the fall of 2014, we had 26 operated rigs running. We reached a low in summer of 2016 with four operated rigs. As we ramped our activity in the second half of 2016, a disproportionate amount of our operated and non-operated drilling was on large, multi-pad pilot development projects. This concentration of effort on a handful of large projects put our production ramp at particular risk to timing delays.","That said, we offer no excuses. We need to do a better job of risking these potential delays and building them into our forecasts. We've learned the hard way, the wisdom of Yogi Berra, who said \"it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.\"","Our 2016 exploration development capital budget is now $785 million, that's up $35 million from previous estimates. The increase is tied primarily to the activity associated with rig additions this year, and approximately $15 million in seismic and acreage acquisitions we made in third quarter. Even though our production ramp has been delayed into Q1 2017, much of the completion cost associated with this ramp will be incurred in 2016.","In yesterday's release, we gave preliminary guidance for 2017. And I want to be clear that this is preliminary. We wanted to give some clarity on what 2017 looks for us, but these numbers for capital, for production, these are baseline numbers. We certainly have tremendous wherewithal to accelerate. We'll enter 2017 with great momentum as the aforementioned deferred completions come roaring back. We currently model total production growth in 2017 to be 9% to 14% year-over-year, with an overweight in oil production embedded in this growth.","We also gave guidance on drilling and completion portion of our capital. Based on our current plans, we plan to invest $600 million in those activities next year. $600 million is within our cash flow for 2017 as we currently model it. So again, we think of this as a baseline. We have the ability to add activity as the year unfolds, and in fact, we're currently looking hard at several projects we have on the drawing board. As always, we will give you an updated look at our capital plans in our next call. That will be in February, and that will include our total E&D expenditures as well as our first-quarter 2017 production. By then, I expect to have tremendous clarity and additional projects and what it looks like as we move ahead on that baseline.","Enough about production. I want to spend a few minutes talking about what we're really excited about. We continue to push the envelope in completion, optimization and innovation. We are seeing outstanding results that have implications for well spacing and landing zones. In both the Delaware and Anadarko basins, we're planning pilots for 2017 that will test even tighter well spacing. These tests have tremendous implications for the depth and richness of our inventory.","We built Cimarex on exploration, and we are hard at work developing new ideas. We have challenged our organization to develop new play concepts and opportunities where the cost of entry is low and real value is created for our shareholders. Our organization has responded accordingly, and we are working on a number of ideas that hopefully will be subjects for future quarterly calls.","Idea generation, execution and innovation have always been the heartbeat of Cimarex, and it's what distinguishes us from an outstanding field of competitors. We are playing to our strength as we seek that proprietary edge that lets us slip in ahead of the crowd. We have some of the finest assets and one of the finest organizations in the business. Stay tuned.","With that, I'll turn the call over to do John to provide further color on our program.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter, before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our remaining 2016 plans.","Cimarex invested $175 million on exploration and development during the third quarter. About 61% was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. Companywide, we brought 42 gross, 17 net wells on production during the quarter. We had an average of five operated rigs running during the quarter. These rigs were busy working to hold acreage in both the Wolfcamp and Meramec plays. We have recently added three rigs, one in the Anadarko and two in the Delaware Basin, and we have plans to add another rig in Anadarko by year-end. While we work through our completion backlog, we will pick up the pace on our drilling activity as we head into 2017.","As planned, during the third quarter we brought the six 7,500-foot long lateral Upper Wolfcamp wells online that comprise our spacing pilot in the Upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County. These completions used about 2,400 pounds of sand per foot, while also incorporating design parameters such as stage spacing, cluster count and cluster spacing from some of our more recent parent-well frac designs. These wells have been flowing back now for just over 90 days, and yet we still have not achieved a peak 30-day average rate. This result is not unexpected, since it usually takes our upper Wolfcamp wells much longer to clean up and reach their peak production rate relative to the Lower Wolfcamp Culberson Wells.","The results of this spacing pilot are especially meaningful in light of a recent result to further delineate the Upper Wolfcamp interval in Culberson County. Earlier this year we completed the Kingman 45 State Unit 2H, which is located in the western half of our Culberson acreage. On our presentation, slide 10 identifies the location of the Kingman well.","Before this well, most of our Upper Wolfcamp drilling had been in the southeastern part of our acreage. This 10,000-foot lateral had a 30-day peak average rate of 2,057 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 1,192 barrels, or 58%, was oil. The Kingman was completed with 1,700 pounds of sand per lateral foot and came online in late April. In its first 180 days, the well has cumulative production of 308,000 barrels of oil equivalent, including 169,000 barrels of oil. This excellent delineation result opens up our acreage on the western half of Culberson County, where we plan to do further testing in 2017.","We also just finished drilling an Upper Wolfcamp well north of the Kingman well in Eddy County, which, depending on results, could open up even more acreage for development in the Upper Wolfcamp. Completion of that will is planned to begin in mid-January.","We've completed 17 gross, 10 net wells in the Permian during the third quarter. Fourth quarter capital in the basin will be focused on completion activities and acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. We currently have five rigs running in the Delaware Basin.","Now on to the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford development project on the east side of the Canaccord in the fourth quarter of 2015. This development covers six sections, of which Cimarex operates two sections. Completion of the wells began in mid-September, with all the Cimarex operated wells now completed and beginning early stages of flow back. These wells, along with partner operated wells, should be coming on production over the next two quarters.","We also completed the Leon Gundy wells, our stacked\/staggered Meramec-Woodford spacing pilot. These wells were brought on production in mid-October, thus it is too early to discuss any results. We look forward to discussing these wells in more detail on our next call.","We also continue to both delineate and hold our Meramec acreage, with our most recent well results in this play performing as expected relative to our pre-drill expectations. Of the four rigs we plan to operate in the Anadarko Basin next year, three of them will be dedicated to holding our Meramec acreage.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll start first with our third quarter production results, then go into some detail on our revised Q4 2016 forecast and the resulting 2016 production outlook, and then, with an underneath-the-hood look at our forecasted late Q4 ramp up in production, I'll give you a glimpse of our preliminary 2017 production outlook. I'll then finish up with just a few comments on LOE and service costs.","As Tom mentioned, with reported net equivalent daily volume of 947 million cfe a day, our third quarter production came in just shy of our guidance range of 950 million to 980 million cfe. Two main factors came into play when comparing our actual results to our guidance. First, we saw an unanticipated net volume reduction of approximately 7 million a day as a result of ethane rejection associated with the processing of our share of outside-operated Mid-Continent gas during the quarter. And secondly, we experienced approximately 13 million a day of production downtime due to slightly longer than anticipated completion times and the shut-in of the wells associated with those completions. These two factors alone pulled us away from the midpoint of our guidance.","If we look at Q3 by region, with the pickup of our Permian completion activity in mid-Q2, our third quarter Permian volume of 517 million cfe a day was up 2% from Q2 2016, while our third quarter Mid-Continent volume of 427 million cfe a day was down 2% from the second quarter, a result of our beginning-of-the-year slowdown in Mid-Continent completion activity, which we just recently picked up, as John mentioned, up here in late Q3.","Looking forward, before touching on our fourth quarter guidance, I want to provide a little color on our frac fleet utilization strategy. To provide consistency in our frac fleet utilization and operational results, and to maintain full control of the timing and scheduling of our frac operations, we've opted to retain a consistent number of fleets to complete our wells. With a fluctuating rig schedule and a good mix of multiple and individual well completion projects, we carefully plan our inventory so as to minimize adding and dropping crews.","If we did add and drop crews, we'd risk the ability to pick up the crews (13:35) with which we've worked so hard to develop our operational efficiencies. Which means that when any completion operation takes longer than expected, either due to an operational or weather issue, or as a result of changing completion design on the fly to pump a larger, more time-consuming job, there's a domino effect on the timing of all completion operations following in queue.","Our Wood State completion is a great example. When we provided Q3 guidance, the then-planned job size required an 18-day time period to complete each three-well pad. Subsequent to providing guidance, we changed the job design, which required a 30-day time period to pump, and pushed back other wells and projects in queue. We saw this in the Mid-Continent as well, and as a result we pushed out first production for some significant wells and projects that were previously forecasted to add production in early Q4, now to come on later in Q4, and pushed others out into 2017.","So in a nutshell, at the total company level, we've moved a number of our significant completions into late Q4, and a total of 10 net wells previously slated for late Q4 into early 2017. With large anticipated production increases from our pilot and infill projects, simply sliding first production two to four weeks has a big impact when projecting volumes for 12-week quarterly time period, and as a result, our Q4 production forecast dropped from our last quarter estimate.","We have a number of significant infill projects forecasted for Q4 in both the Permian and in the Mid-Continent. In the Permian, we revised our first production timing for our Wood State project in Reeves County, with first production now forecasted for late November\/ early December, versus our last quarter estimate of October. With the revised completion timing, we've also moved first production for five net Permian wells, including production from our Tim Tam project, into early 2017.","Similarly in the Mid-Continent, revised timing for frac operations has pushed out the timing for first production from our East Cana infill project, with our operated Nancy Condrey (16:49) sections now scheduled to come online in November and December, and our non-operated project sections now forecasted to come on in the December to early 2017 timeframe. As a result, five projected net Mid-Continent wells have also moved into 2017.","So when the dust settled, our updated Q4 production guidance now sits at 945 million to 985 million cfe a day, with a fast production ramp forecasted for the latter half of the quarter. With the increase, we are projecting December total company net equivalent volumes to be in excess of a Bcf a day.","As Tom mentioned, we have put together a preliminary nine-rig plan for 2017, funded comfortably with projected 2017 cash flow projections using our current strip. With the carryover of our Q4 '16 completion activity, and the anticipated ramp-up in associated production into 2017, we're projecting a preliminary estimate of 1.05 to 1.1 Bcfe a day for our full-year 2017 production. As compared to the midpoint of our current 2016 full-year production guidance, this represents a 9% to 14% increase in production during 2017.","As Tom did, I want to again emphasize as well, this is a very preliminary plan. The plan can change as a result of many factors, including changes in commodity prices and\/or changes in any of our activity levels, our project selection, and the timing of our capital deployment.","Shifting gears to OpEx, we posted another nice guidance beat with our third quarter LOE, and we owe it all again to our production groups' continued efforts to reduce our operating cost structure. We commend their efforts, and with their focus we continued to realize significant cost reductions during the quarter, seeing some nice reductions in equipment and maintenance, contract labor, and rentals in particular.","As a result, our Q3 lifting cost came in at $0.61 per Mcfe, at the low end of our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.75, down 6% from Q2 and down 27% from the $0.83 we posted for an average in 2015. After incorporating our continued cost control efforts and the fluctuating nature of workover expenses, we're projecting our remaining year lifting cost to be in the $0.60 to $0.70 range.","And finally, some comments on drilling and completion costs. We continue to see our drilling cost components remain relatively in check, and have seen our completion cost components for the most part level off. That said, we're beginning to feel upward pressure on completion costs, with any increase most likely to occur after the beginning of the year. With that, we continue to focus on efficiencies on the drilling side by cutting down drilling days, and on the completion side by optimizing our completion design, optimizing our water sourcing, and optimizing our pumping operations.","With our costs in check, our generic well AFEs are flat to last quarter in the Permian. Our current Bone Spring 1-mile lateral AFEs are ranging $4.7 million to $5.1 million. That's flat to last quarter, but down 6% from earlier in the year. In the Wolfcamp, with larger completions, our current generic 2-mile lateral Culberson Wolfcamp AFE continues to run in the $10.2 million to $11.2 million range. That again is flat to last call, but down 5% from Q4 2015 and down 23% from late 2014.","With our larger frac design, our Cana core 1-mile lateral Woodford AFE continues to run in the range of $7.1 million to $7.5 million. That's up from the $6.6 million to $7 million range we quoted with smaller fracs earlier in the year, but we're still down 10% from late 2014.","And finally, as we continue to experiment with frac design, our current 2-mile lateral Meramec AFEs are running in the range of $10.5 million to $12 million, with frac design really being the largest cost variable in the total well costs for our Meramec wells.","So in closing, we had another good quarter. We continued to make strides to reduce our operating cost structure, we stayed focused on efficiencies to reduce and optimize total well cost, and we continue to make progress maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells. Although we've seen our completion timing push out first production for a number of our bigger projects, due primarily to pumping bigger and bigger jobs, we're very pleased about our well results, and for that matter, we're very pleased about our entire program.","So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.","Our first question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. My first question, Tom, is just thinking about the 2017, call it preliminary outlook. A couple of questions around that. One is, if I look at your spending in the quarter, you spent $175 million, and if you annualize that you'd be at $700 million, and your rig activity is ramping. So I'm just trying to put that into context relative to an initial D&C spend of $600 million? Because it does like you are accelerating from that $175 million that you spent in Q3?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. Arun, I'm going to give you an overview answer and then I'm going to turn it over to Mark for the detail. The quarterly spending is really a function of drilling rigs but also completion timing. And it's driven not only by the pad development timing, but there's also a fair amount of non-operated timing. That preliminary $600 million is an annualized rate if we kept those nine rigs running throughout the course of the year. Quarterly spending can fluctuate depending on how that gets bunched up. Mark, do you want to add to that?","Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah, Arun, we have a little choppiness in our capital spend levels with the amount of completion dollars we have in any one quarter. Actually you'll see in the fourth quarter, applied guidance has quite a uplift in capital costs for completions, of which we will have a number of completions occurring in the fourth quarter, a lot of them later in the quarter. But you'll see an upward kick into 2017. And as Tom said, it's a nine-rig program timed out with the capital and completion dollars with that program.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Arun, just to finish that thought, we're feeling really solid about the quality of our returns, the quality of our program, and the things we want to accomplish. So even though I know oil markets are a little nervous here in the last week, we're feeling a little better about some of the fundamentals, and so our bias as we sit today \u2013 and again this is just today \u2013 but our bias is going to be to lean forward on that capital number, and we're looking at a lot of things that we want to get done, and we'd like to get them done sooner rather than later. So I think there's a pretty good chance we'll be giving meaningful updates here in our next call.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And if I could just elaborate on that point, because the initial, and again understanding its initial, but right now if you look at our forecast and consensus, it's between $1 billion to $1.1 billion of EBITDA, so the number that you put out there last night would suggest quite a bit of free cash flow generation. So I'm just trying to understand is if you guys are thinking how you plan to balance growth versus potential free cash flow, and is there an intention, as we think about modeling for next year, to spend your cash flow? As you know, this is a market that is rewarding growth to a decent extent?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, the market will reward what the market rewards. There's a pretty big difference between a spreadsheet and iron deployed on the ground. And we're poised for increased activity. We have lots of things to do, and our bias is going to be \u2013 we don't have a great interest in keeping cash on our balance sheet; our bias is going to be to activity. And we focus on the returns on that investment, and as you know, you all get tired, I sound like a broken record, I think growth is a nice outcome of really good, prudent investments. And we're feeling pretty confident about those investment opportunities. Mark, do you want to comment on that?","Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah, Arun, as we talked in the past, over the last six months, we've been continuing to watch for stabilization in commodity prices. It's been seeming that some more stabilization occurring lately, but obviously even more recently there'[s some more pressure on oil recently, with some of the OPEC discussions. But certainly, with the Street forecast probably embeds a low mid $50 oil price, if that kind of environment starts to play out into 2017 and we feel that's a good price to be working off of as far as capital generation, certainly want to increase our capital level.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes, I will say from my viewpoint, I have a strong bias to spend our cash flow. And if we have any kind of signals of stability \u2013 and we think we are seeing those signals. We've talked a lot about structural reset in the markets, and we feel like we are starting to see that. And so our bias is going to be to spend our cash flow, and possibly \u2013 that cash on our balance sheet is there to be invested. So we're looking at it carefully. It's a good question, and you're right on point with the way we're viewing that.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Hi, Drew.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, Tom. So on the 2017 program, the capital plan indicates to me, at least, a really big uptick in capital efficiency. And I think that's clearly occurred on the well productivity side. Is there an element of cost improvements at the well level for the further efficiencies that Joe talked about? And I did catch that he said costs really haven't gone down at all from 2Q, so was hoping you could provide some color there?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. Mark, why don't you take the capital efficiency, and I know Joe will make some comments on costs.","Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah, right. Drew, there is definitely more of a program going with longer laterals and we also have the efficiency improvements we've seen in our uplifts and our frac design. There is some capital efficiency embedded in it. But certainly there's also some efficiency gained from the fact that we are bringing forward wells from 2016 into 2017, that's a big part of what's happening into this next year's forecast, is the fact that we have carryover, as we mentioned in the release, 10 wells carrying over from 2016 that we previously thought would in the fourth quarter into 2017, so that's helping, getting that front-loaded production into 2017.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","And this is Joe. I'd say that's the primary driver to the capital efficiency calculation there, that you've got our significant East Cana infill projects coming online right at the end of the quarter, you've got the Tim Tam, you've got the Wood stage, you've got big chunks of new production starting off the year in 2017 with the capital deployed in late 2016.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for the color. And then if we can go over to the Culberson Wolfcamp A, I think is one of the highest rate of return assets in your portfolio, if not the highest. And so given the successful delineation you've had across a lot of that position there, do you expect to move into more of a development mode in 2017?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. This is John. Yes. I mean, there is both a combination, we still have some acreage obligation we need to do, and I need to point out what's really, really nice about that Kingman result is it gives us great encouragement to, quite frankly, put more wells over there on that west side, which further helps us secure our acreage across the entire Culberson position. So that was a really significant outcome for us, we're really pleased with that well.","Likewise, as we continue to monitor our current spacing pilot, the Sunny-Gato pilot, we're already in plans for the next development phase of Upper Wolfcamp. We have a couple of sections in mind, and really the thing we're debating it just how tight do we want to put the wells. And again, a little bit of time here as we continue to watch the flow back of our current spacing pilot.","And I just want to make another comment, as much as I can't talk a lot about it because we haven't gotten our \"peak rate,\" I would still consider a very encouraging sign that we're still seeing continued improvement, that is, the wells are continuing to clean up. I think we're encouraged by that, and hopefully by next call we'll be able to give you a lot of color on those actual results of those wells.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, John. And I guess with that in mind, does that give you comfort that you'll be able to incorporate the results of that spacing pilot in time for budgeting for 2017? Or would it still be kind of, prior learnings would be the basis for your capital plans in Wolfcamp A?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I think the only thing I would say is, within our budgeting for 2017, we've incorporated some development in Upper Wolfcamp. What might change, again, is maybe a well count on a section where we'll maybe add an additional well or two. But the full scale of the budget, I don't think that will have a huge impact on it. But, no, our intention is to incorporate the results from that pilot to then help dictate how we go forward with our future development in the Upper Wolfcamp. But those Upper Wolfcamp developments currently on the schedule, I believe, aren't really start drilling until late second, early third quarter, last time I looked at it.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah, Drew. the word development doesn't mean what it used to mean. Everything we do, we're testing something. The beauty of our assets is that we're making really good returns while we test it. But there's some great innovative thinking going on in our organization on stimulations and well spacing, and we've got some significant tests to look at that could have meaningful implications for our overall inventory. So we can use the word development, but everything we do has learnings that impact future operations.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Tameron of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. I'm going to go back to 2017 again. If I just think about the big pad completion coming online in the first quarter, how should we think about your quarterly kind of production run rate through the year? Should it be flattish to a slight incline drought the year, or how should we \u2013 any guidance you can give me there? Any color you can give me there?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes, this is Joe. As modeled, with the larger projects coming on at the first part of the year, and then as we look out through the remainder of 2017, the placeholders that we currently have in place are more single-well project in nature. You'll probably see a ramp in the first two quarters of 2017, and then relatively flat for Q3 and Q4. But again, this is just a preliminary plan that we put together based on capital assumptions for 2017.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks for that color. And then I guess Tom, if I look at \u2013 I'm looking at slide 13 of the new deck, which is those Upper Wolfcamp completion design, those four Wells in Culbertson. And I look at that and then I look at the prior \u2013 same slide from a couple months prior, and it looks like the blue and the red line are \u2013 that increase is decreasing over time, so that gap's narrowing over time?. And I'm just getting back to this, there's this debate a couple years ago that's kind of got lost lately, but are you pulling more value forward? Are you really increasing the EUR? What exactly \u2013 what's the endgame as far as these higher completions? Can you \u2013 can I look at these four wells and make a determination based on that? Or can you give me more color, what you think, as far as ultimately what the \u2013 is the sand really driving higher EURs, or are you just accelerating that value, I guess?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I'm going to just set the stage, and then John will take it from there. The devil's in the details, and one of the things that completion and optimization really allows you to focus on is rate of return. So we don't really judge it by production uplift nor EUR uplift. We look at the return, and that's usually defined by certainly your first 18 to 24 months of production.","And there's a raging debate as to at what point we end up accelerating and at what point we're having a new reserves. But as long as we focus on the return on an incremental completion investment, and we use really good, well-grounded data in doing that, that's not really a first order of concern. It's something that we will learn over time.","Now, again, the devil is in the details when you compare this blue to the red curve. There's lots of optimization in the Wolfcamp that we haven't experimented with, and I'm going to let John take it from there.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, the first thing I would say is I would again emphasize what Tom just said. When we look at these additional costs on our frac uplifts or optimization, we are always looking at it from the standpoint of the incremental cost relative to the rate of return that that well achieves, and that is our first and foremost measure. We certainly also look at \u2013 we debate a lot internally over, yes, how much of this \u2013 is there a component of acceleration versus how much of this is new reserves? And honestly, there's still a lot of that to be determined as these wells continue to perform, and we'll watch that very carefully.","As far as innovation, yeah, I don't \u2013 I do not believe, for either the Upper or Lower Wolfcamp, that we still have achieved the optimal frac for an individual well. And we talk about that all the time internally. And we have a lot of experimentation, in fact a well in particular coming up that we're going to test a lot of concepts and ideas, where we still think there's possibilities to achieve \u2013 or recover more reserves out of that rock.","So I guess all I could tell you is, we watch it carefully. We monitor it carefully as far as the incremental cost to make sure it's a good decision, and we're going to keep trying to innovate on it.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","I might just finish with one point, I'm not \u2013 we wouldn't look at slide 13 as necessarily the guiding light to make this decision. There are lots of things that are second-order advancements or innovations, and that would include cluster spacing, it would include pounds of sand and fluid per cluster. And so it could be that the blue and the red curve may lie on top of one another, but if we can get more wells per section, that's a huge, huge advance for us. So again, the devil is in the details on this.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. I appreciate the color though, helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next call comes from Pearce Hammond of Simmons Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Color on 2017. My first question is, when you look at well cost per lateral foot, do you think that's starting to level out, and maybe even start to move up as the intensity of the completions increases, as well as just service costs moving up?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes, this is Joe. I'd say the general answer to that is yes, but it's, like we've been talking about, here too, the types of design of your frac, the pounds of sand, the amount of fluid, your cluster spacing, your science projects, what have you; I tend to look at it more on the basis of cost components, because they're the variables we can measure. And what we're seeing on the drilling side are relatively flat cost components. On the completion side, it's no secret, you've heard the likes of Halliburton talking about increasing their service costs, we anticipate that it's entirely possible we may see somewhere, 5% to 7% some-odd increase in our completion service costs as we move forward.","But overall, when you put it in the blender and turn it on, there is so many variables. How efficient can we be at sourcing our water, and we're spending a heck of a lot of time on that. And again, optimizing the cost-benefits of the different frac designs, so that whatever the cost is we see the optimal side of it on the production side. These are all things that we're constantly scrutinizing and studying, and the end result is what Tom and John have both alluded to, what's our best rate of return? So I kind of danced around your question, but I think I left you with some flavor.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","No, that's helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-on just sort of grows from that, but when you put out your preliminary 2017 capital budget, have you done those services to kind of lock them in, so that you don't have the incremental service cost inflation on top of the guidance that you've already put out?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","No. We've got just wonderful relationships with our service providers, and I think we know well in advance about what our cost structure is going to be looking like the next three to six months out. We have strong confidence that we'll be able to manage our cost, particularly on the completion side, through the duration of 2017.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Thank you for taking my...","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","I just want to follow-up on that. We typically don't prefer to do long-term service contracts. And I know there's lots of people that see that problem differently. Locking in, that's \u2013 works on both sides, and I'm not sure who is locked in. We like flexibility. We like the ability to adapt our program up and down depending on changing conditions. So we're typically market takers. We look for good relationships, as Joe said, we look for high quality service companies, we look for safe, responsible service companies, and our history as a company has steered us away from long-term contracts.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, Tom, and great detail so far. Say, Tom, just when I was looking up at slide 10 of yours particularly that talks about the Culberson and Wolfcamp details, and you guys have certainly added just a large amount of new oil gathering. And so some of your peers mentioned maybe being constrained next year, or having the infrastructure limit what they can grow. Is that going to be any sort of issue for you all, particularly in the Delaware Basin, that would limit your growth in any regard?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","We don't see that as a constraint over the next couple of years. We always model that out, both on a local and a basin-wide level. And certainly we've got a good relationship in Culberson, Plains is our gatherer and they've got good takeaway capacity and we're in very good shape there. There's been a tremendous amount of processing capacity built out in the Delaware Basin.","We look at not only that, we look at gathering, and we also look at basin takeaway, and we're typically looking two to three years out, because that is usually the window in which if you have to lock up firm or do some kind of contractual obligation with a midstream Company you can build in advance, but we currently don't see that as an intermediate-term constraint. Do you want to comment on that, Joe?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","I agree entirely. We've \u2013 when we put our project together with Plains, we had done a number of multiyear models on targeted drilling programs \u2013 or projected drilling programs and the resulting throughput. And we have a high degree of confidence in the capacity of the oil pipeline system that's currently in place in Culberson. And then likewise on the gas side, adequate processing and at least, given where we are today with the number of projects that are out there, two, three years' worth of capacity on the processing side and also on the takeaway side. So we feel very comfortable about both the gas side and the oil and NGL side \u2013 all three of them, I guess.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So, guys, does that just \u2013 again, it seems like others have to use a lot of their capital to do some of this build-out themselves. But you all, certainly \u2013 is it because of your great relationships and looking this far out with some of these third-party partners that you don't have to use the capital, and you have more than needed?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, we do spend midstream capital. And in Culberson, in particular, we do own and operate our gathering system, and that's been a great benefit to us, as our Permian production manager reminds me every chance he can get. It's been a really, really smart thing for us, and we reached out and did some risk in doing that.","And \u2013 but we have capital discipline. We really look at our midstream investments carefully. We want to make sure they're balanced against our drilling and completion capital and not get ahead of ourselves. And that's been important to us. So I think Cimarex probably does view midstream a little differently than some of our peers, and we like just-in-time midstream investments.","I'm going to finish by saying that both those outlets in Culberson, the Plains and the MarkWest plant that was built, that was a really great outcome through the partnership we have with Chevron \u2013 the joint development agreement with Chevron. And I think it's been well crafted, and it's a great benefit for both companies.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then just lastly, really quick, Tom, just on bolt-on opportunities, either Permian or Mid-Con, what's your thoughts as you look into 2017?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Just for general opportunities?","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes, sir. Just for bolt-ons there for either one, just to sort of block up either of those -continue to block up those positions?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, we look at every asset on the market. And I get asked from time to time, do we just count our money differently? And maybe we do. We have a very difficult time with some of the acreage prices that are becoming commonplace. But we look, and we would love to do bolt-ons. We're also seeing a lot of operators come together now and have a greater willingness to swap acreage, so we can drill 10,000-foot laterals. John, do you want to comment on that?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, yeah. I think over the last year or two \u2013 and I'm proud to say, I think we led that way with our long lateral results, you had a number of other Wolfcamp operators who were kind of stranded with their sections with only 5,000-foot laterals. And now we're starting to see more and more other companies willing to talk about trading acreage, section for section, such that they as well as us can leverage long laterals. And we're getting a few more of those deals done with a couple of different companies out there.","And I would not be surprised you'll see more of that happening where each company tries to kind of block of their own acreage. So then you get those capital efficiencies, with the long laterals as well as the midstream assets and disposal. So we'll see more of that. Would I love to get more bolt-on acreage? Absolutely. And as Tom said, we look at every deal possible, especially adjoining to our position. And we just can't seem to come to the same valuations that others are able to in this current market.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the details, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Morning, Tom and everyone, thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping just to go back to \u2013 I know you guys gave a lot of information around the discussions and the delays in Cana. I just wanted to clarify little bit, the increased time \u2013 you talked about the impact obviously of the ethane rejection, but the increased time, was a created from having to shut in wells? Was the time itself just related to the frac job itself? And is there an expectation of significantly longer time for these wells to be cleaning up once they're on line?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is Joe. The answer is not embedded and it's taking longer for the wells to clean out. It's entirely tied to the timing of the frac itself and the duration of the operation of the frac. And the loss, I guess if you want to call it that, as compared to the previous forecast in production with a longer timeframe for a given well that is newly completed. But also in conjunction with that, we are offsetting wells in and around the wells that we're fracking. And the delays that we see there is going to get a little bit multiplied, if you will, by some number based on the number of wells that are offset.","So it's a combination of both. It is entirely due to when we anticipated a frac to start in our Q3 guidance, and end, and the wells that would be associated with that frac that were shut in and the volumes that would have been deferred.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So the shut-ins were anticipated, just the duration of it was not?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Correct.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that. And then...","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","David, I just want to add to that. One of the challenges is, with these pads, the shut-ins are longer in duration than we're typically used to, and it's more significant than it's been to us historically. Some of these shut-ins, if you are on some of these significant pads, you might be shutting in offset wells for a couple of months while you complete them. And that's a little different issue.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. Especially I would say operationally in the Permian. I think we're more used to it in the Woodford because that's how we've been developing our acreage. We do multi-section development, so we anticipate the significant shut-ins. Honestly, up until this year in the Permian most of our shut-ins were always associated with a one-off parent well, and typically then we'd only experience a week of shut-in. Now when you go to major six-well developments like Wood, and then you incur a little bit longer time because of the frac design change, that certainly then led to far longer shut-ins than we typically had been used to. Obviously now we're adjusting, and we will plan for it accordingly, going forward. But that's really what, hit us pretty hard in the Permian here, in this last few quarters.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","And gaining a better understanding of the wells that will most likely be associated with that operation, to be shut-in.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I appreciate that. And my last one was just, you talked about the three rigs, I guess, running in Meramec next year to HBP, and I guess want to delineate. Can you just remind us how much of your acreage will be held, then, with the three rigs? And then I guess with the one delineation well, I guess you're testing various pilots. What area of your acreage do you think there's sort of the most debate about that you'd like to do some density tests on, and to which zones?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Let me be clear in terms of my statement. The three rigs that I referred to will be holding acreage while delineating Meramec acreage, it's kind of a combination of two things. Those three rigs through the end of the year will pretty much ensure that we keep all of our Meramec acreage intact, with those three rigs throughout the rest \u2013 all of 2017. The fourth rig that will run in Anadarko will more \u2013 most of the time be dedicated to more Woodford drilling in areas where we're testing other Woodford concepts. Again, the three rigs will be both holding acreage but also delineating, in a sense, because we still have areas in the Meramec that we'd like to get results in and get a good idea of how well it will perform.","I will say that a lot of our acreage holding in the Meramec will be in more of that northwest part of the map, that's where we got out ahead a couple years ago, that's where a lot of our term acreage is. And so that area where I think previously we announced the Peterson well, as well as the People's well. We have a lot of acreage to hold up in that area, so we have a lot of rigs headed \u2013 a lot of drilling to do next year in that area.","And so far, both ourselves as well as some of our competitors have announced some very impressive wells in that area. So inasmuch as we're holding acreage, we're holding acreage with what appears to be some really good rate-of-return opportunities with the rigs we'll be running there.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much for that color, John. I appreciate the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jason Smith - Bank of America","Hi, good morning, everyone. Tom, just coming back again to the 2017 guidance \u2013 and I wanted to touch on slide six really quickly \u2013 can you help clarify what oil growth looks like, relative to total growth in MBOEs next year?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","No. We didn't give specifics on oil growth, Jason, but if \u2013 what I said is, we're talking about a top-line growth number, and oil growth that underpins that that will be substantially larger than that top-line number. We'll give some color on that on our next call. But I will go ahead and tell you we're pleased with what we're seeing in oil growth for 2017, but I think I'd like to defer specifics until we can come back at you with much more detail on our capital program. Was I sufficiently evasive there, Jason?","Jason Smith - Bank of America","No, I appreciate that and I appreciate. It's a bit of a moving target right now. But \u2013 and maybe sticking on that front, in the Cana, your partner yesterday led out a pretty optimistic picture with a nice step-up in oil yields relative to legacy production. So as you move beyond your current set of completions, can you just talk about how the Cana-Woodford fits from a capital allocation standpoint into next year, and maybe just the timing around your next set of completions?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I'll start and John will still add on to this. Certainly a lot of what we're looking at in the Woodford next year is on that eastern corridor, which is much oilier. It's offering outstanding returns, and I think you will see a joint project along that eastern corridor in 2017. And we're in the process of formulating that, but yeah, it'd be an oilier project. John?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yes. It's an exciting project because, as our partner elaborated \u2013 I saw their write-up on it \u2013 it is a long lateral development project. It's 10,000 foot laterals in an area where we get very good condensate yield, with very good rate of returns. I will tell you, the biggest questions we have regarding that, quite frankly, is how many wells per section do we want to put? Based on our previous results in what we call Row 4, Armacost Phillips, where we pushed the spacing even tighter, we've been very pleased with those results. Likewise the current developed section, the eastern core infill, our partner has a number of sections were they again are testing tighter spacing.","Those results, as well as perhaps even some other things we want to test, might lead to even more wells per section within that development, which even makes it more appealing to us. So there's a lot of discussions with our partner about that, and we fully anticipate, certainly in the second half of next year, that we will be deploying rigs on that development project in the Cana area.","Jason Smith - Bank of America","Thanks, guys. Appreciate the answers.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I guess one more follow-up on the 2017 outlook. Certainly sounds, like you've said, your current view is preliminary and the bias is towards more activity. I am just curious on what sort of timing is required, in terms of how quickly you need to lean into that budget to really impact 2017 growth?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah, Michael, that's a great question. Certainly these projects have fairly significant legs to executing and before you see production. I will tell you that our bias is sooner rather than later. I think that one of the lessons we've learned is these projects that are second-half projects that roll into the following year, it just adds noise to our reporting that is artificial. It has nothing to do with the quality of our assets, the quality of the program, but it's just noise. And so if we had a choice between getting something done early in the year or later in the year, I think you know where we're going to land there is earlier in the year. So between now and our next quarter we're going to be hard at work trying to line some things out. We would like to get it done so that we are not having these fourth-quarter discussions.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Makes a lot of sense. And then I guess a follow up on my end, you've talked a bit about exploration in the prepared remarks, just curious kind of how you think about the exploration announcement that we all got regarding the area to the south of you in Culberson County, and potentially missing that opportunity? And then second question within that, is there a Woodford or Barnett possibility underlying your Culberson block?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, I'll just say that we studied that play for a while, we've been watching the activity. As far as missing an opportunity, we could probably have a museum full of plays we've missed; that's just part of our business. We have a lot of respect for Apache and we root for them. I think it's an interesting concept, obviously they have some challenges between now and commerciality, but they've talked about that and they know how to do that. As far as other opportunities, I will let John handle that.","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","We \u2013 internally we have quite a number of step-out exploration ideas that we're churning, and some quite \u2013 in fact, one that we're drilling on right now. These are \u2013 this is what we do as a company. We have tasked our regions and our groups to come up with new ideas, new exploration opportunities where quite frankly we could get ahead of the crowd and get reasonable leasing opportunities at reasonable cost and then take the risk on the drilling side. And we are doing that. And we have a number of those that we will be doing over the coming year. As typical for us, you won't hear a peep out of us about it until we ourselves have convinced ourself that we have something that is material to the company, and then only then will we talk about it.","But rest assured, we are pursuing a number of exploration ideas, and we will always be doing that because, quite frankly, that's where we find we get the biggest bang for our buck from a value creation standpoint for this company.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Very good. Make sense. Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Allman of FBR. Please go ahead.","Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thank you. Hi, everybody.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Hi, Joe.","Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Sorry if I missed this, but what is your preliminary guidance on other spending besides the $600 million for D&C? So in 2016 you're spending about $175 million on infrastructure and leasehold and capitalized interest and capitalized G&A and other. So what's the guidance for that for the same items for 2017?","Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.","Hi Joe, it's Mark. We'll give out guidance to the other components in the February call, but you're on the point as far as what we're incurring for other capital for this year. So it's \u2013 we still have to make some assumptions on, some leasehold assumptions as far as what leasehold acquisitions we want to build into our budget and so those components and production capital will have to be settled out as well. But we'll make those guidance figures when we give our February guidance.","And also to make a point on the runway to $600 million, which we did give guidance for was drilling and completion capital only, and actually, as Arun actually asked earlier, that $175 million is total capital, which is not comparable to the $600 million of drilling and completion capital. We actually incurred $125 million of drilling and completion capital in the third quarter. That's the comparable number to the $600 million. So the run rate is for drilling and completion only of $600 million, and that's on a nine rig program.","Joseph Allman - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. That's helpful, Mark. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning. Not to put a damper on wanting to spend more, but I actually thought 9% to 13% 2017 growth on a flat spend was rather impressive. Can you characterize what portion of the growth is completion carryover from 2016? Maybe improved year-over-year well performance, or other factors like more efficient D&C?","Mark Burford - Cimarex Energy Co.","That's a hard number to dissect, which is the component of carryover completion capital. We will be having a nice ramp into the fourth quarter from the wells we're completing by December, as Joe mentioned; by exit rate would be over a Bcf a day, so we're going to have a nice ramp going into next year, but dissect what component of next year is volume contributions from carryover activity versus improved performance, it's hard to dissect that.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","I mean, there are some. Clearly we borrowed a little from 2016 into 2017 in our capital spending level, but it's not a bunch. We just haven't calculated that.","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is Joe. What I would say there is that Q3 of 947 Mmcfe, and I mentioned December at over 1 Bcfe, so there's 50 million cfe a day of brand-new production just entering 2017, and there's still a climb (61:24) into the first quarter with the other carryover that I mentioned of the ten wells coming into 2017. So I wouldn't be surprised, if we dissect it, that there's a fair percentage that it is carryover.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Maybe another way to think of it, this may be getting out over our skis too early, but based on what you are thinking about now, if you did do a nine-rig program, if that's what it ultimately ended up being, could you create similar growth in 2018?","Joseph R. Albi - Cimarex Energy Co.","On a nine-rig program, a similar type growth into 2018 I think would be difficult.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","But again, that's \u2013 we haven't really gone into detail there. The thing that we like where we sit right now, as we look at our assets, at current conditions, we're in an environment where spending within cash flow, we can generate growth and great profitability. And that's something that a couple of years ago, if you had said, in a $50 oil environment, was that a possibility, we'd have been pretty challenged to say yes. But it's really a testament to the quality of our assets and what our organization's done in innovation on our stimulations, but also getting our cost structure down, that LOE decrease is significant to us in what it does to our margins. So just leading into your opening question, we are pretty pleased with what the landscape looks to us as we model out-years.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","It sounds like you've got great flexibility and we'll look forward to see how it \u2013 how the next couple of months unwind. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Grigel of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, good morning. Just on the 2017, to hit one last item, on the non-op spend, some of your partners have talked about what could be a pretty material ramp in 2017 in a rig count. How do you guys think about that, and how much of that has been factored into that $600 million?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","This is John. First off, I'll just simply say in the Permian we don't have a lot of non-op that necessarily drives our program. We're basically 100% operators on most of our acreage besides the Culberson JDA with Chevron, but in Culberson we are the operator since we dictate the budget there. The bigger issue clearly is in Anadarko. First off, of course, we have an AMI partnership with Devon, and we work hand in hand; we are constantly feeding each other exactly our plans. And so we are able to easily put that into our budget forecasting.","The area where it gets a little more cloudy, especially in the Meramec is, yes, there's a lot of \u2013 all of a sudden we are getting hit with a lot of outside-operated wells scattered throughout that play. A lot of activity. That has caused probably little bit more capital what we originally planned, but it's not a huge component. But we'll certainly \u2013 we will be accounting for that going into next year, as well. I will point out again, just like I said early in the Permian, what you will see shake out in Anadarko is once everybody gets to the position of holding their acreage, then you get into where people start doing acreage swaps, or trying to block up, and then that gives you big greater control again over your capital plans.","So in the short, we do account for it. We recognize it, but I don't see it as being a major component, or something that's going to completely lead to a large outspend for us.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, no, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the Permian side. You guys make a note in the presentation that you're revaluating 28,000 acres in Ward County. Could you provide some more color about what the revaluation process is?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, this is Tom. We've talked about that. We do have some new ideas, and Ward \u2013 Ward again is looking very interesting to us. And all I can say there is, stay tuned.","We had said in past years that Ward was challenged for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is some of the prior development, and that it would take a new idea in order for Ward to again be at the front of our plate, front burner, and right now it's front burner.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And is that driven by new completion techniques, or is it more on drilling or something else?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well it's kind of all of the above. And we're having to tests some things. So we will be commenting on that in future calls.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from John Nelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess just on the 2017, I know we will get more color in February, but there is $700 million of cash on the balance sheet, so we think about your potential desire \u2013 assuming we do see some stability \u2013 to lean in, is all that on the table, or how should we think about the magnitude of potential outspend?","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Well, It's all on the table. We raise that capital to bring our net asset value forward, and that's still what it's sitting there waiting to do. Now we'll probably deploy that over a couple of years; I don't think you see us say, hey, Katy bar the doors we're going to run through that money in one year. But I think that is certainly there, poised for meaningful acceleration, and that's our bias. I mean, that's what we want to do. We have no interest in keeping cash on our balance sheet.","John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, very clear. Thanks guys. Take care.","Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Hanson of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Mark Hanson - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just inking about the mix there of long versus \"short\" laterals as we head into 2017, I guess all else equal your preference is for long laterals, I think you said that in the past. But as we think about the 2017 plan, one versus 1.5 versus two-mile laterals, if you could comment on that, that would be great?","John Lambuth - Cimarex Energy Co.","Yeah. This is John. It's very simple; if the acreage is there and allows us to, we always plan to go two miles. It's just that simple. We are that convinced that our best rate of returns that we can achieve is by drilling a two-mile lateral.","Quite frankly, some of the drilling want to go longer than 2 miles, and we talk about doing even that, and we may eventually test a longer than a two-mile lateral. But the simple answer is, if the acreage allows us \u2013 and fortunately the majority, the vast majority of our acreage allows us \u2013 then it is our preference to go long. The only time you're going to us consciously choose not to drill a long lateral is like some of these spacing pilot tests, where we're trying to get vital information on how tight to put the wells next to each other. And quite frankly, the length of the lateral doesn't really dictate that result. And so in that regard, we kind of see that as an efficient way to spend our capital, is just to do it is a 5,000 and get the result, and then leverage that quickly to 10,000-foot laterals in development.","So I guess the simplest answer is yes, our bias in any opportunity or any chance is to go long with our wells. And almost \u2013 the vast majority of all the wells that we'll drill in 2017 will be extended laterals, in both basins.","Mark Hanson - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Karen Acierno for any closing remarks.","Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.","Thank you, Nan, and thanks everybody for joining us.

We're pretty excited about the landscape ahead of us, and we really do look forward to our next call. We're going to be hard at work between now and then. Given I know there's been a lot of questions about 2017, we kind of opened a can of worms with what we have said today, and hopefully you've gotten a flavor of just the quality of our program, and we'll come back with a lot more detail here on our next call.

Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Burford","Thank you very much, Denise, and welcome, everyone, to the Cimarex second quarter 2014 conference call. Speaking today here in Denver will be Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; John Lambuth, VP of Exploration; and also here in Denver represented, Paul Korus, our CFO; and Karen Acierno, our Director of Investor Relations. We did issue our financial operating results financial release yesterday after the close. A copy of the release can be found on our website. We also posted our latest presentation, which we may make some references today on today's call. I need to remind you today that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we've discussed. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K and other filings and news releases for the risk factors associated with our business.","With that, I'll go ahead and turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden","Thank you, Mark, and thanks to all of you participating in today's conference. We appreciate your interest in Cimarex as always. I'd like to take a few minutes to touch on some of the highlights for the quarter before turning it over to John and Joe for a more detailed update.","The second quarter of 2014 were strong in many fronts. Production of 839 million cubic feet equivalent per day led the day and was up 22% year-over-year, 13% sequentially and above the upper end of our guidance. This, coupled with strong product prices, led to revenues of $623 million. Cash flow from operations of $443 million came close to covering the 488 -- $498 million we invested in exploration and development during the quarter. We closed our $238 million acquisition of properties in the Cana-Woodford area and raised $750 million of high-yield debt at the low price of 4 3\/8% interest. Cimarex ended the quarter with $129 million in cash. And on July 31, we closed on the sale of our Kansas properties for an additional $136 million of cash.","As always, we're happy to report our quarterly results and look forward to a detailed discussion and question-and-answer session, but as you've heard us say time and again, we do not manage around quarterly goals. We're looking to maximize the rate of return of our projects over the long haul. We're looking to maintain a focus on solid execution and innovation and keep a disciplined approach as we do that. We're going to be giving you a number of updates on a number of fronts and we look forward to some good questions. But I will say that a lot of it is work in progress. We're wholly encouraged across many fronts. But one of the things we've learned in our history is that you have to keep that discipline and focus, don't make early calls, stick to your knitting and make sure that you understand before you proceed. So we'll give you all the detail we can.","Our progress continues in the Permian Basin. 3 of the 4 pilot programs begun earlier this year are now producing and generating good returns, while providing valuable information for use in our future development. We've seen markedly improved results with long laterals in Culberson County and improved results in Reeves County with changes to our frac design. And we have successfully applied larger completions to Bone Spring wells, which should generate higher returns. In the Mid-Continent, our new completion is allowing us to redefine the core of the Cana-Woodford shale, and we're intrigued by the early results in the Merrimack formation. We sit in an enviable position in that we have 2 premiere basins on which to balance our portfolio. Both the Mid-Continent and the Permian are generating top-tier returns, and that's giving us tremendous flexibility in investing our cash flow for the highest rates of return.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John and Joe to discuss the details of our progress and look forward to any questions you may have following their comments.","John A. Lambuth","Thanks, Tom. I'd like to quickly cover some of the highlights of our overall program before getting into the Permian region. I'll then finish with our Mid-Continent region and the results in Cana.","Cimarex drilled and completed 85 gross, 51 net wells during the quarter, investing $498 million. 71% was invested in the Permian region, and the rest went toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. Of those 85 wells, 47 were in the Permian region where we continued to be focused on the Bone Spring, Avalon and Wolfcamp formations in the Delaware Basin. Bone Spring activity in the second quarter included 12 net wells in New Mexico and Texas. Results continue to be good, generating some of the highest -- some of the company's highest rate of returns, with oil volumes representing up to 84% of first 30-day production. Cimarex has drilled some exceptional Bone Spring wells in the White City area, which is located in Southern Eddy County, New Mexico, just north of our Culberson County, Texas acreage. In particular, the Marquardt 12-H was completed in the 2nd Bone Spring sand and had a 30-day average IP of 1,620 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 1,047 barrels of oil. The Bone Spring in White City is similar to what we see to the south in Culberson County, a fixed section with more gas and higher rates. The Marquardt well was completed with a 15-stage frac, a larger completion than we've traditionally used in the Bone Spring. We have now completed several Bone Spring wells using upsized frac jobs and are pleased with the results so far.","As you know, about half of the Permian drilling capital this year, approximately $685 million, will go toward further delineation of the company's Wolfcamp opportunities in the Delaware Basin. This includes downspacing pilots, wells drilled to hold acreage, testing long laterals and delineation wells designed to help us understand this vast resource. We have increased our acreage position to 235,000 net acreage in our Wolfcamp fairway, up from 225,000 acres the last time we spoke. This is the result of the acquisition of about 4,000 additional acres in Reeves County and an increase of 6,000 acres in Culberson County. We are currently producing from 6 distinct Wolfcamp zones across this Wolfcamp fairway.","One of Cimarex's innovations during the first quarter was proof of concept with regards to long laterals in the Wolfcamp. We define a long or extended lateral as anything over 5,000 feet. We now have 11 extended laterals producing across our acreage, 6 of which are in Culberson County. Between now and year end, we have 14 long laterals planned in the Culberson area, with 8 being in 10,000-foot laterals, while the remaining 6 are 7,500-foot laterals. 3 of those 3,500-foot tests will be located in the Wolfcamp A interval. We also have 8 long laterals planned in Reeves County, all located in the Wolfcamp A. One of those wells is being completed as we speak with you today. That well is a 10,000-foot lateral, which is an offset to the RUBY well which we announced on our earnings call a year ago. The RUBY was the first 10,000-foot lateral Cimarex drilled in the Wolfcamp and has accumed [ph] 190,000 barrels of oil in its first year of production, a very good well.","To more fully understand our excitement about long laterals, I'll refer you to Slide 13 in our presentation. This chart updates our previous chart, which illustrated the increased returns we have experienced from upsized fracs. You'll see we've added a new line in green, which plots the performance of the Gallant Fox, a 10,000-foot Wolfcamp D well that was completed using 43 stages. Simply put, the result is amazing. Even at a downside chase of $75 oil and $3 gas, this well generates a before-tax internal rate of return of over 100%.","We continue to work on an optimization of our completions in Reeves County. When we started using the larger fracs in Reeves, we saw uplift but less than we experienced in our Culberson wells. We've been able to improve that result and recently completed the LIVINGSTON well, a 5,000-foot lateral, which had a peak 30-day IP of 1,368 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 30% uplift to our previous Wolfcamp A completions. When we started in Ward County, we tried a landing zone and a completion style similar to Reeves County. Just like Reeves was different than Culberson, Ward has proven to be different than Reeves. We do see a large resource in place in Ward, but are slowing down our activity to 1 rig while we work on the proper completions and landing zone for this area.","Lastly, in the Delaware Basin, I'd like to give you an update on the status of the spacing pilots we currently have underway. Please refer to Pages 16 and 17 of our presentation for an illustration of the designs. I'll speak to them by area, starting first with Culberson County where the 2 pilots drilled earlier this year are now producing. The stacked lateral tests did confirm that the Wolfcamp C and D are separate benches, with the wells exhibiting different initial yields and flowback pressures. We are still evaluating the performance of the wells in order to determine our next step. The same can be said of the 4-well, 80-acre downspacing pilot in Culberson County. We have preliminary production data, with the 4 wells having a 30-day average IP of over 1,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. While generating good economics, this is not enough production data from which to draw any conclusions on spacing yet. That said, we do have plans in place to drill another 80-acre downspacing pilot in Culberson later this year, where we'll be making some adjustments to the initial design, such as staggering the landing zones vertically between wells within the deep edge.","Our 4-well, 80-acre downspacing pilot in Reeves County is now producing, although it's too early for 30-day rigs. And like the Culberson pilot, more data will be needed before we can draw any type of conclusions. The fourth pilot is our stacked and staggered pilot in Wolfcamp A and Reeves, which will test for the downspacing and the viability of landing more than 1 lateral in the fifth Wolfcamp A section. The sixth and final well for this pilot is drilling now, with the completion of all the wells planned for September.","Now on to the Mid-Continent area. We are pleased to report that our ongoing efforts to introduce upsized completions in our Cana program continues to provide good results. In addition to applying the larger frac to development wells, we are also testing the concept on acreage outside of the core development area. Success outside of the core means additional acreage and locations available for development. We are pleased with the results we've had so far. We drilled and completed a delineation well called the Leota 1-19H in an area up dip to the Cana core area. The Leota is a 5,000-foot lateral completed with a 20-stage frac. It achieved a peak 30-day average IP of 11.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 662 barrels of oil. The 8 offsetting wells had an average 30-day IP of 3.9 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Those 8 wells, of course, have the older-style frac, thus, the Leota's IP is a threefold uplift to that to the surrounding wells.","We have 5 more Woodford delineation wells planned for later this year, with one of them being a nearby offset to the Leota designed to confirm this excellent result. We've also completed our first long lateral in the Woodford. The Bomhoff 1H-11X was a 2-mile lateral completed using 41 stages. This well has been on production for over 70 days and has an average 30-day IP of 12.9 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 436 barrels of oil per day. Another outstanding result.","Finally, we drilled our first Merrimack test, located in the same section as the Woodford long lateral, the Bomhoff 2-11H had a peak 30-day average IP of 9.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 306 barrels of oil per day. Our preliminary mapping of this interval would suggest that we have between 50,000 to 100,000 of perspective acreage for the Merrimack, although further delineation wells will need to be drilled in order to confirm this. We currently have plans to drill 4 additional Merrimack wells this year. Inasmuch that we are encouraged by this first well, we are a long way from determining the ultimate potential for this geologic interval.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi.","Joseph R. Albi","Well, thank you, John, and thank you, all, for joining our call today. I'll touch on the usual suspects, first, hitting on our second quarter production. I'll discuss our revised 2014 production outlook, and then follow up with a brief discussion on where we see our operating and service costs.","Our second quarter net equivalent daily production came in at 839 million equivalents per day. As Tom mentioned, that is 9 million a day, above the upper end of our guidance range, which was 810 million to 830 million. And in doing so, we set a new record, once again, for the company. We had a great quarter from a production standpoint, with very nice production contributions from both our new well completions, as well as solid performance from our base properties. At the total company level, our second quarter production was up 6% from our Q1 reported volume of 740 million cubic feet a day and 22% from our Q2 '13 production level of 687 million a day. We saw production gains in both the Mid-Continent and the Permian, wherein both programs, we set new records in all product categories, whether it be gas, oil, NGLs, total liquids or equivalent volumes.","In the Mid-Continent, our Q2 '14 volume of 426 million a day was up a healthy 15% for Q1 and 24% from second quarter last year. Cana continued to be the driver here, with our second quarter Cana volumes coming in at 309 million a day. That's up 21% or 54 million a day from where we were in the first quarter in Cana. In the Permian, our second quarter equivalent volumes of 393 million a day were up 13% or 46 million a day from the prior quarter and 23% or 74 million a day from our Q2 '13 volume of 320 million a day. Permian oil production continued its growth trend during Q2 coming in at 33,317 barrels per day, and that was up 5% from Q1 '14, or the first quarter, at 11% over where we were in the second quarter last year.","So looking forward. With solid production during Q1 and Q2 and strong momentum going into Q3 and Q4, we've upped our full year total company guidance range to 860 million to 875 million a day. That's reflecting a 24% to 26% growth over our 2013 average of 692 million a day. To get there, our model is projecting our Q3 production to fall in the range of 920 million to 945 million a day. That's a forecasted increase of 28% to 32% from Q3 '13 where we averaged 717 million a day.","A couple of things to talk about with regard to what's happening underneath the hood with our guidance. Built into our projection is anticipated production acceleration from our Permian program during Q3 and Q4. Through June, we completed 51 net wells in the Permian, that's approximately 40% of the total wells that we plan to drill for the year. As such, our model incorporates 80-plus new Permian wells to come on during Q3 and Q4. That's a 60% increase in the number of Permian wells in the latter half of the year as compared to what we completed in the first half of the year. Also, with the larger mix of our higher oil-producing Reeves County-Wolfcamp wells and our Avalon completions coming on in Q3 and Q4, we're modeling our Permian oil production to accelerate as we close out the year. As an example, we completed 7 of our Reeves County-Wolfcamp wells in the first half of the year and we have plans to complete 20 more additional wells in the second half of the year. Likewise, we had 2 Avalon completions in Q1 and Q2 and we're planning to have 11 more in Q3 and Q4. And that's what's really driving our accelerated oil production growth as we close out the year.","Our revised full year guidance is up from our previous 2014 production update, which projected an average of 835 million to 860 million a day when incorporating the Cana acquisition. That's a midpoint increase with a revised guidance of 20 million a day, and I want to emphasize that our latest increase in guidance to 860 million to 875 million a day is entirely due to our new well and base property results, not the inclusion of our Cana acquisition, which has been incorporated into both our current estimates and obviously, our prior update.","The drivers to our full year guidance increase are coming from multiple fronts, strong new well performance in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent, our focused attention on our base property production, focusing on reducing downtime, accelerating -- enhancing our compression run time, our reworks, our cleanups, et cetera. That's all having an impact. And in addition -- on top of that, excuse me, we also have seen some improved recoveries in the Permian. So all these factors are coming into play. The improved recoveries in the Permian are particularly due to us obtaining 2 new takeaways off the Triple Crown system. Those takeaways are providing higher netbacks in their processing than we've seen on the system and have impacted our NGLs in the second quarter, and I anticipate for that to continue as we close out the year. In addition to gas takeaway out of Triple Crown, we've got a good focus on a long-term solution, to move oil out of Culberson County by lane, are planting the seeds now for the addition of an oil-gathering system, along and around the vast project area.","Shifting gears to OpEx. Our Q2 lifting cost came in at $1.13 per Mcf, that's flat with Q1 and at the low end of our full year guidance range of $1.12 to $1.18. Although we're seeing cost pressure in areas such as labor, compression, rentals and SWD, our strong production levels and the continued focus on controlling cost have kept our lifting costs in line. So with Q1 and Q2 coming in at $1.13, as well as a good number of our liquid-rich Permian wells yet to come online by the end of the year, we did pull down the top end of our lifting cost guidance range down to $1.17, which then gave us a projected range for the year of $1.12 to $1 17.","A few comments on service costs on the drilling side. Top drive rigs continue to be in short supply, with the delivery dates for newbuilds now extending into 2015. Despite the pressure for rigs, all other drilling component costs continue to seem to remain in check and has been that way for the last few quarters. And with the service cost relatively flat, our drilling team continues its focus to reduce total well cost via operating efficiencies. And a good example is in our Culberson-Wolfcamp program, where our average days between spud and rig release have dropped from 57 days when they first started the program in 2010 to 32 days in 2013, to 29 days here in the first half of 2014.","On the completion side, we've seen some slight cost pressure in the market for services and materials, primarily associated with the transportation of crop, not the raw material cost from crop. Any significant cost increases that we've seen on the completion side are directly associated with pumping bigger jobs, more stages, more fluid, more crop. And as a result, completion costs are now making up 60% to 70% of our total well cost in programs like Cana in the Mid-Continent, and Avalon, Bone Spring and Wolfcamp in the Permian. With the larger jobs, our total well costs have increased. However, our well results and totals to incremental benefits are definitely worth the additional cost.","As we continue to experiment with our upsized frac design, our current Cana total well costs are now in the $7.2 million to $7.6 million range. And that's up from the $6.3 million to $6.5 million levels we saw in early Q1 when we were employing the smaller fracs. The increase in Cana is entirely attributable to our upsized frac. Our initial AFEs for a 2-mile Woodford well in Cana, with an upsized frac, are now coming in the range of about $11 million to $12 million.","In the Permian, our current AFEs for 4,500-foot second and third New Mexico Bone Spring well is running in the range of $5.9 million to $7 million depending on depth and frac size now as we begin to experiment with more frac stages in the Bone Spring. And our shallower White City in Culberson's 2nd Bone Spring program, our AFEs with the larger fracs are running in the $5.7 million to $5.9 million range. And our current Avalon wells are running in the $7.3 million to $7.6 million range, also incorporating these larger fracs.","As we continue to experiment with upsized fracs in our Wolfcamp program, our current AFEs for a 4,500-foot lateral remain in the $8.5 million to $9 million range depending on the geographical area that we're drilling and the size of a frac. And our 2-mile Wolfcamp lateral AFE is running in the neighborhood of $13.2 million to $14.2 million range, again, highly dependent on frac design.","So in closing, we had a great second quarter. A strong new well, production adds and solid production performance from our base properties resulted in us exceeding our guidance. With strong wind in our sails, we've raised our full year production guidance. We're keeping our LOE and service cost in check and we're making good progress fine-tuning our completion design to optimize our new well production. We're extremely proud of our entire organization for hitting on all cylinders.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to question-and-answer.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Brian Gamble of Simmons & Company.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","I think, first, let's start with that Slide 13 and that wonderful green line. Maybe you could talk about how you plan to replicate that through all of your locations? I know that you're planning another 20 10,000-foots or -- excuse me, 20 long laterals by the end of the year. How much variability do you think you're going to see in the rest of those wells, as well as how many 10,000-foots do you think you have in both counties, in Culberson and Reeves, if you've thought about that ultimate number yet?","John A. Lambuth","This is John. I guess I'll take the first stab at your question. Obviously, we're very pleased with the Gallant Fox result, but I will just point out that the Gallant Fox itself is just a confirmation of the Montrose, which we talked about earlier. So it's a nice confirmation that these 10,000-foot results in Culberson are repeatable so far. But now I must caution you that, obviously, we need to duplicate this over the broad acreage position we have in Culberson. So it's hard for me to sit here and tell you that every 10,000-foot lateral is going to be a Gallant Fox throughout that whole area. But so far, obviously, we've been very pleased with what we've seen there. As far as the total number of 10,000-foot laterals, I don't have that number right off the top of my head. I mean, obviously, the beauty of the shares on JDA is that entire acreage position is entirely set up for 10,000-foot laterals, and that's why it's such a wonderful acreage position to have with Chevron there. In regards to Reeves County, our ability to drill 10,000-foot laterals is strictly a subject of continuity of acreage. We have quite a few long river tracks, which enable us to drill wells like the RUBY. But I would also point out, we have areas which we call Grisham, which is a nice continuous block that, indeed, we intend to set up with 10,000-foot laterals there as well.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, Brian, this is Tom. I'll just chime in here. When you look at Culberson County, the entire acreage block is available for long laterals, and that's because of their joint development agreement. A block in Eddy County where we're also getting outstanding results is mostly available for long laterals. I wouldn't quite say all, but close to all of those available for long laterals. And then our working land model in Reeves County, so it's about half of it is going to be available for long laterals. And that's 7,500 feet to 10,000-foot long laterals. So we have tremendous runway ahead of us to exploit that green curve.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. That's perfect, Tom. And then switching gears, first, Merrimack well. That number sounds pretty good to me as far as having the first test down. 4 more wells this year. I guess how far apart are you planning on drilling these wells? I mean, you mentioned 50,000 to 100,000 potential net acres. How spaced out of the remaining 4 are going to be as far as trying to delineate that to some degree?","John A. Lambuth","Well, this is John again. Clearly, these additional wells we're drilling are designed both to step out in the range of 5 to 10 miles away in some cases. I mean, they're designed to do many things. They're designed to test different yield expectations within the rock itself. There's even 1 design just to reconfirm the results we've had right there. So we've given a lot of thought as to where these delineation wells will go, all of it geared towards just getting a better handle over what ultimately decides the price here. And I would just point out, inasmuch as we say there's 4 wells now, there will be many more depending on the early results. If we get any encouragement from those initial wells, you're going to see us then layering even more wells to further delineate this position. Let me just finally say that the acreage number we quoted, which is a wide range, the 50,000 is kind of what we see based on this well, and how we map it is something that we feel pretty good about. But we need those delineation wells to even carry that out even further to possibly up to the 100,000-acre number that we quoted.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes. And then the other issue with the Merrimack, as John pointed out, is yield. We think we're in a window of that play that's quite thick and has excellent deliverability. And the deliverability may be increasing as you go from the liquids into the gas. So we need to test that deliverability. There will more likely be an economic limit where it goes to dry gas. We're rather suspecting that the rates will be eye-opening, but the economics will be great because it will lose our liquids contribution. We don't know that until we get down there and drill it. And we're always ready for surprises and we'll react when we get them.","Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And just to that point real quick, Tom. The NGL and gas cut, if you could, of that well you gave the oil cut, and can you give the other breakdown?","Thomas E. Jorden","John is looking for that. I don't have that committed to memory.","John A. Lambuth","I don't have it either. I can calculator it.","Thomas E. Jorden","Why don't we go on? Why don't we go to the next question, and we'll come back in with that answer while we look for it.","Operator","The next question will come from Matt Portillo of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 questions for me on the Delaware side. I continue to hear a lot of positive industry commentary around the Avalon, and I was wondering if you could provide a little bit of context on some of the delineation work you're doing, kind of further south of your lead position. And then I guess the second question in regards to the inventory depth that you provided. I think that's based on a 4-well per section downspacing. But curious how you guys are thinking about the downspacing opportunity within the Avalon Shale in and around acreage position given kind of other industry success so far?","Thomas E. Jorden","In regards to the Avalon, a, yes, we are trying to delineate and expand the opportunity for what we consider to be the oil window for the Avalon within the Delaware Basin. As of right now, I don't have any results to talk to you about, but we are definitely looking at ways to expand the opportunity set for the Avalon. As far as spacing, we have noticed a number of operators initially started 4 wells. We now see people going even tighter, spacing 6 wells, even tighter than that. We have a number of pilots that we have planned that will be coming on here later this year where we'll be testing a much tighter spacing. I would just say, let us get those under our belt before we say anything more clear about what we think the ultimate spacing will be there. But without a doubt, what we observed in the trend in this play is too much tighter spacing than the original 4 wells per section that people originally talked about.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just a second follow-up question on the completion front. Kind of 2 different points. I guess, on the first, I know that I think you guys were testing a tighter density stage frac in Culberson County. It was up to 30 stages on a 5,000-foot lateral, and I was wondering if that has been flowing back? Or if there's any color that you can provide on how that well is performing? And then a second question in regards to the profit. I know that you guys have really moved the needle on the Delaware Basin for the amount of profit you're using per well. We're starting to hear about an additional increase on the Midland side of the play as guys move to kind of 1,600, 1,700 pounds per foot. And I was curious if you're looking at potentially even upsizing your fracs from what you've done so far in the play?","Joseph R. Albi","I'll take that. Second question, first. We're studying that hard as to what the optimum pounds per foot is, and it's not always clear to us that more is better. I mean, we're looking at stage spacing. We're looking at cluster design. And then we're also looking at optimizing our fracs, but depending on whether we've got a parent well or an infill well. Our pilot project has given us a lot of data to chew on, and one of the things that we're setting is that the proper frac for an infill well may not be the optimum frac when you go to put them 80 acres apart or 660 feet side-by-side. So that's something we need to seriously test. We also are testing landing zones, and John mentioned that and I just wanted to underscore that, that we are -- our current pilots, with the exception of the one in Reeves County that we're still drilling on, were landed in the same stratigraphic zone, and that Wolfcamp is a very thick zone. So we're looking at a follow-up pilot where we'd still go into that same 8-well per section, but we would stagger the landing zone. So we think that may be an important innovation. So a lot of things still in the works. We're not anywhere close to figuring this out, but we're very pleased with our results. We've got a tremendous resource in place in the acreage position, and it's working.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, in regards to your question about the wells -- a well in Culberson, where we went from 20 stages to 30 stages on a 5,000-foot lateral, I would just say we definitely saw an improvement in the performance of that well. But so far, the economics don't really lead us to believe that that's the optimal design just yet. But I'll also caution you that when you go to 30 stages like that, some of that uplift may be in the longer-life production of the well, that we -- it would be surprise -- it won't surprise me one bit that 6 months from now, we'd look at that well and go that it's a much better design for us. We don't know. But as of right now, it wasn't a tremendous uplift like we've experienced with some of the recent changes.","Joseph R. Albi","But it's a close call. I mean, essentially, that 30-stage job, initially we looked at it, and we said, no, it's probably not giving us the uplift we need. And then a month or 2 down the road, we looked it and said, well, wait a minute, this thing's looking like it's holding in a little stronger. And so it's a close call. And it just underscores that you can make these calls off 30-day data. I mean, you can do an okay job on the parent wells. You go into these infill wells and you don't want to fool yourself. That decline is one of the critical elements that parameterizes success or failure.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jason Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Tom, CapEx this year is still 75% Permian, but you're starting to add a bit of incremental capital to the Cana. So with the confirmation success in the Cana, how should we think about capital allocation now going into '15? And I guess what I'm getting at is where does that rig count go from today?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, in Cana, the rig count's increasing. We have plans to do additional infill drilling starting late this fall and in the first quarter of 2015. So there will be some additional infill drilling. We've committed 2 additional rigs moving in. And we'll be picking up the pace of Cana. The -- we haven't formed our 2015 plans yet, but I will say that every decision we make will be around rate of return. And as we look at some of these recent results in Cana-Woodford, I can say that we're becoming almost indifferent as to whether that capital lands in the Permian or lands in Cana-Woodford. I mean, that's how good our Cana-Woodford returns are. I don't want anybody to mishear me. The Permian, we love as much as ever. But all of a sudden, the Cana-Woodford, with this new completion design and the delineation we're doing, is looking to us like it's delivering heads-up comparable returns. And that gives us tremendous flexibility. The Permian is under a lot of pressure as to a midstream standpoint, from markets, from field availability, from service availability, and it gives us a relief valve on our capital program. So as we look, we'll probably do a little more in Cana, probably a little higher percentage than it was this year as we look into 2015. We haven't figured out yet what that will be, but it's a great problem to have.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And you guys provided some color on gas price sensitivity for the Culberson long laterals. With the upsized fracs in Cana, can you just talk about what gas price you would potentially have to reconsider there?","John A. Lambuth","Well, again, this is John. I would just state that with those summer prices that I quoted, we always run our downside sensitivities, and those wells are still very attractive to us at both the $3 flat and $75 oil, a very good rate of return on that. I don't have it right in front of me, but still, they generate good returns.","Karen Acierno","We ran a case on the Golden Section, just the section that is in the book that we illustrated, and we ran a downside case to 2 50 and still had returns that were close to 50%. So...","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, that may not be the average. I mean, that's a good result. The sensitivity is a judgment call, and we run sensitivities to oil price, we run sensitivities to gas and NGL price, and then you kind of have to lay back and say, all right, are they going to all fall together? Or is one going to fall and the other not? So I'll say this. If we have a Cana play that can stand $3 or $2.50 gas, that looks pretty good to us. And so we're quite happy with these results in Cana from a top line rate of return standpoint.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And if I can throw maybe one more quick one in on Ward County. I know water has been an issue there. I mean, so I might have missed this in the prepared remarks, but are you guys looking at altering the completion design? And as you kind of go down to 1 rig, are there still delineation tests planned for the B\/C?","John A. Lambuth","Yes and yes. We are definitely altering our completion design. Again, as I stated in our remarks, we definitely recognize that what works well in Reeves doesn't necessarily work well in Ward. We've made some significant changes to our completion design and we have several wells that are in the process of either flowing back or have been stimulated with these new designs. And we're monitoring those wells very carefully. Likewise, yes, we are currently drilling a lateral testing the B\/C zone, as well, within there. This, I would just say, is no different than what we experienced, and as I said earlier on in Culberson and what we experienced early on in Reeves, and that you don't get it right the first time. What's important and what we recognize is, again, there is a tremendously thick resource in place there, and it's just a matter of us finding the right recipe in order to capture good economics out of it. And that's exactly what we're doing. I will also point out though, again, that we have the luxury of going down the 1 rig, essentially the 2 rigs that we moved out, one went to Reeves, one went to Culberson, because of the breadth of opportunity we have, we can do it right in Ward. We're not in hurry, we're going to get it right.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","The first question I wanted to ask was what percentage of your Cana liquids production is condensate?","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, on average, it's 5% over the bulk of...","Joseph R. Albi","Condensate. It's all condensate.","Thomas E. Jorden","I'm sorry. What percentage is condensate? Yes, it's all condensate. Thank you. I was giving you a percentage of the total stream.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","What did we end up with, what percentage?","John A. Lambuth","Cana will be -- we call it oil in Cana. It is the condensate in Cana, what we produce there.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. So I was just wondering, I mean, is it -- are the volumes significant enough now, or are they going to get significant enough with your growth that you could consider taking advantage of any of the recent Department of Commerce decisions to allow stabilized condensate exports without license? We've heard from some other operators say that they're getting a significant price uplift by trying to reach the export market.","John A. Lambuth","Yes, Jeffrey, we are obviously marketing our condensate barrels through purchasers, and they might be working on applications to export those condensate barrels which hopefully translate to better realization to us. But no, we're not looking to make applications to export directly.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And the other thing I wanted to ask about today is, I just want to confirm that I thought this -- you seem to outline that there is going to be an increase in Permian completions in the second half. And I was wondering is that -- was that just due to faster drilling than you had planned? And if so, what were the primary drivers of the faster drilling, or was it something else?","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe. That was basically nothing more than how we scheduled our rig lines. And most of our early-year development activity was focused particularly on the Wolfcamp because it generate -- takes up such a good chunk of our budget. Our Wolfcamp was really focused on Culberson in the first half of the year and teeing up our Reeves County projects really culminated, and then coming online here at the end of the year. So it's nothing more than a product mix and rig timing, and so forth and so on, how it all played out.","Thomas E. Jorden","This is Tom. As much as you'd like to think that if you have 18 or 30 rigs running, it ought to be smooth, it tends to be lumpy and it just works out that way. And our program is going to be lumpy in the second half. It will be lumpy for a while.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And if I could ask one last one real quick. You said you're going to drill 4 more Merrimacks in 2014. But do you know how many you'll likely complete? And I mean, how many more results we might hear before the end of the year?","John A. Lambuth","This is John. We just now have spudded and are drilling the first of those 4 that I mentioned. And again, I say 4. It could even expand. But we're on the first one now, which to me implies we won't get completion for another 2- to 3-months production. You probably won't hear from us until probably sometime in early '15 on any additional Merrimack results, now because we're just now getting started on those delineation wells.","Operator","Our next question will come from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the stacked lateral tests in Culberson. It sounds like you had positive results versus what you're hoping to test, the independence of the zones producing from one another, but you mentioned you want to see similar of the performance. Can you speak to us specifically what you're looking for?","John A. Lambuth","Yes, this is John. There are several things that we want to monitor closely in order to ultimately determine how much communication, if any, is between those laterals. We, quite frankly, even have a lot of science that we haven't fully evaluated for that stacked lateral, whether it's microseismic or tracer data. And so there's a lot of outstanding data that we're still looking at, accumulating, that we want to look at before we can really set -- put a marker down as to what truly was the outcome for that stacked lateral. We at least wanted to give you a little bit of flavor of what we saw initially, which is, as I've described, different yields, different flowing pressures. But again, time will tell what that stacked lateral and what its implication would mean for us.","Thomas E. Jorden","Another test that we have yet to do is we have a tremendous amount of work to do on landing zones. We've already done a lot, but those 2 laterals are pretty close together, and we have a lot of flexibility to lower that detest. We haven't determined yet whether they are in pressure communication. It looks to us like they're most likely not. They're producing different yields as we had to expect and hope. But yes, as John said, we have a lot of science to do, and we just have to be disciplined and focused on making sure we get it right.","Joseph R. Albi","This is Joe. I'd just comment one other thing. It's not, and you hit on this, Tom, it's not those first 30 days. It's what happens to that well 30, 60, 90. How does your decline rate change? How does your yield change, if it does? And what is that really telling you about communication and landing zones and then resource recovery?","John A. Lambuth","I'll just -- a final follow-up. I mean, Joe is right. From these wells, we have an expectation of what a parent well decline should look like. So 30 days out, 60, 90, we have an idea, we put our tight curve on it, what it should do. That's what we're looking for. We're looking for that they perform along that same type of a profile.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And Tom and Joe, just to go back within -- you mentioned the landing zone. How much experimentation have you done to date with different landing zones within the D?","Thomas E. Jorden","We've done a small amount of experimentation. We're looking now -- the pilot, for example. If we do a follow-up pilot, one thing that's being discussed is landing those little deeper and staggering them. So we can put -- we have latitude in the D to put wells 80 to 100 feet apart in vertical separation, and it would still be D wells. So we've been all over with landing zone. We haven't really tried it, though, side-by-side, stacked with staggered. So we have a lot of data yet to collect on that.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's really helpful. And one last one just on the marketing side. Have you any efforts underway to get your crude to the coast, either Gulf Coast or West Coast?","Joseph R. Albi","Yes, this is Joe. What we're -- we have been focused on and will continue to be focused on is direct purchase to a purchaser off the lease. Where we see some potential relief is, come early 2015 when there are -- there's new infrastructure between the Delaware Basin and Colorado City and then alternatives to the Coast, and we're hoping that we'll see that reflected in the pricing, which would take into account the Midland [indiscernible] differential. Our project, and I can't elaborate too much on it, in Culberson would consist of not only just the gathering of that oil off the Culberson system, but hopefully, a good long-term takeaway solution out of the Delaware.","Operator","The next question will come from Ipsit Mohanty of GMP Securities.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities L.P., Research Division","You introduced the upsides to Delaware in the quarter before. Last quarter, you did that in Cana. I just wonder, as you stand right now, what's the extent of your application of upside across Bone Spring, Wolfcamp and the Delaware and then in the Cana, are all wells, going forward, going to be all upsized fracs?","John A. Lambuth","This is John. I'll try to answer your question. Upsize is a phrase we throw out fairly common. I want to be clear. With each play, we're constantly asking ourselves, is our frac optimal for that particular well. And what we have experienced over the last year is in the areas like you mentioned, in Wolfcamp and Avalon and Cana, that clearly, no, that our previous frac design wasn't optimal. We've made changes. With each play, those changes are different. There is no one recipe within -- in each play. So if anything, I would say that every play is kind of upsize for us now. I mean, we're always looking to say what is the right recipe to get the most hydrocarbons out of that well. We've been a little bit, I would argue, slower in the Bone Spring. Here, recently, we made changes in the Bone Spring and we're very pleased with what we're seeing. That will probably not be the last change we make, and we'll probably test something else there. And I think that's probably the message you should take, is that in all of our plays, we're going to always be constantly asking ourselves, are we optimal and should we be trying something else? And that's really the message you should take from us in regards to these frac designs.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then just a slightly broader question on your development strategy into Delaware. Look, it sounds like as you -- there's a lot of data to do before you can declare a win in the stacked concept. So as you get -- as you develop the great wells in Wolfcamp D and some of the other ventures like A, what's your base of trying to delineate the various stacks? Or what's your motivation for trying to go ahead with the stacked concept versus just drilling some of these highly profitable wells in the separate ventures going to be?","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, well, I'll take a stab at that. A year ago, we talked about getting teed up and ready to go to development in the Delaware Basin. And these pilots initially were designed for us to make decisions that will allow us to go in the full development mode into 2015. Now if we had to do that, we would do that. And I think that our results have been very good, and if we had to make decisions today to proceed based on what we know today, we would achieve very nice rates of return if we were to go into full development. But then something wonderful happened to us. The innovations that we've been experimenting with in the Permian Basin, we applied to Cana, and we had an absolute game-changing result at Cana. So today, we have the flexibility of taking that capital, redirecting it to Cana and doing additional science in Permian. So we don't have a schedule today for when I would say we'll be going into full development mode in the Delaware Basin. I will say that our top line capital will be growing, assuming that prices hold up and our cash flow holds up. And we have outstanding places to invest in out of the Permian or Cana. But we'd like to do a little more science and get it right. Because you only get one chance to get it right. If you're in development mode and experimenting as you go, you really run the risk of wasting capital, and we want to get the best returns we can. And right now, we think that's probably deferring full development for a while, and the nice thing is we don't sacrifice an iota of rate of return because of what we're seeing in Cana.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities L.P., Research Division","Got you. And then one last on acreage. You mentioned you added some acreage in the Culberson. Do we assume it's going to bolt on to where you were already? In other words, is that something you can leverage to extended lateral, as well?","Thomas E. Jorden","We're always looking to add acreage. The Culberson was really a recounting. I mean, we -- as silly as it sounds, you always circle up. You want to make sure you understand your ownership, you understand your right, and that was just kind of truing up on accounting of our acreage, not necessarily leasing new acreage. We do always look for new opportunities. We've recently leased new acreage. And I will say we recently chose not to lease new acreage because it's gotten highly competitive, and we think our returns -- it has to compete for returns.","Operator","The next question will come from Cameron Horwitz of U.S. Capital Advisors.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","You guys have obviously been at the forefront of the upsized frac phenomenon in the Permian. And I was hoping you could just give us some comment about some of the steps you may be taking to secure the sand supply that you're obviously going to need and just the logistics of getting all that sand to the well site?","Joseph R. Albi","Yes, this is Joe. We have not procured any long-term relationship with the sand mines, what-have-you, but we are working hand-in-hand with the 2 majors, Schlumberger and Halliburton, laying out our frac schedule, if you will, 2-year out. We've got a well-to-well cruise assigned and lined up and we're trying to stay well out ahead of our frac schedule with our materials and getting them in place. We have had absolutely no indication, at least from our end, that there's a shortage of getting this stuff. We're trying to procure it. The only -- we've seen a very modest increase in service cost, but we've offset that with our optimal performance in getting our stages done quicker. The materials have remained relatively in check. The cost of crop has stayed somewhat flat, but it's the transportational profit is where we've seen any kind of cost increase. And most of that is due to the trucking. And you're up in more sand, you got to truck more sand, and that's kind of the supply\/demand relationship that happened there. It's maybe, in start, white sand cost up from about $0.08 of a pound a year ago to $0.11 now. So where I'm heading with all this is although about a year back, we did look at a potential relationship with an outfit to provide the sand and then we transport it to our wells. It's a heck of a lot easier for us just to work with our service provider to arrange for that.","Thomas E. Jorden","We've talked in the past about as we're putting a lot more effort in the planning, and that effort is an ongoing and ever-going process. We've got an active 5-year plan where we look ahead to our rig schedule and we're scheduling all the resources that we think will be required to execute our program. That includes sand, as you've mentioned, it also includes rigs, it includes water, water disposal, electrification, includes services, field services, materials, and most importantly, people. And we're ahead of the game. We've met with vendors and midstream companies. We think we have a good plan. We think we have an execution and path forward. And we're putting a lot of energy into it. We typically try to avoid long-term commitments, if we can. We're generally market-takers, and the markets are very efficient at adjusting to supply and demand.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Great. I appreciate that color. And then I just had one more quick one, and moving over to Cana, I'm realizing it's obviously very early, but are you detecting any evidence from the longer laterals there that you're going to see a better decline profile? I think you said maybe you had 70 days under your belt, and just maybe remind us about how the acreage is set up over there in terms of if you were to go to a longer lateral program and what the dynamic is from a lease standpoint there?","John A. Lambuth","This is John. While we're 70 days in, that well has taken quite a while to clean up. So -- and quite frankly, we have yet to even reach our peak 30-day average. What we gave you was a trailing 30-day average. So the well, I mean, we're very pleased with the well, but we're long ways from making any comment about what the decline profile will look from that well.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, I mean, the rate is still increasing, still playing out.","John A. Lambuth","It is. We drilled that well specifically in an area where we have a great acreage position to leverage that toward long laterals. If we choose to do that in the future, there's upwards of around at least 8 contiguous sections, which lend themselves -- operator sections, lend themselves to long laterals. But that's something that we just have to wait and see how this well performs, and then possibly even follow up with another one before we get comfortable, looking at that from a development standpoint. But yes, our position, our acreage position is well-suited for this if we decide to go that route.","Operator","Our final question today will come from Irene Haas of Wunderlich Securities.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","A question on the Merrimack. Just trying to get my head around the whole exploration process. So you have an area towards the north that's probably more liquid-rich, and as you go to the southwest, you got a little gassier. How many wells do you think you would need to get comfortable with how continuous the trend is? And are you targeting different zones? How continuous is your reservoir? And really, ultimately, what kind of reservoir is it? Does it have a lot of water issue? These are my questions on the Merrimack.","John A. Lambuth","Well, my first comment is you ought to come work on our exploration test. Maybe you can help us answer those questions. Yes, as we've said about the Merrimack, there's a lot still -- believe it or not, we don't understand about the Merrimack. Although, we are actively acquiring data with the core data, logs, and so on. Some of the things that we are recognizing that is similar to the Woodford, we believe, there will be a variation in yield as you go, let's say, from immature up-dip various, to more mature down-dip various. And so that's one thing that these delineation wells are going to try to test, is the boundaries of essentially that yield expectation. As Tom alluded to earlier, we -- I think we kind of know where dry gas is going to be. We certainly know, as you get very far up dip, where some of our competitors are, we kind of think we know where the oil window is. What we're still trying to figure out is just what is the true sweet spot. Obviously, we're very pleased with the first well, but that doesn't mean we're in the right spot yet. The other thing I would say is, yes, it's very thick. And we happen to choose this one particular landing zone, quite frankly, based on where a lot of competitors were landing. I will tell you that if we're drilling our next well right now, we had a very healthy debate internally as to where we should land that well. Again, we're learning as we go along here. I would argue, a good -- we talked about 4 wells, probably in the range of 8 to 10 wells under our belt before we really start getting a good handle over what the true opportunity set is here that we have in front of us, is the way I would think about it.","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, Irene, one of the challenges that we see is it's not a reservoir that just jumps out on longer slots and you say, wow, look at that, let's go drill it. It's a combination of core data, month-long shows. But there are also empirical results from ours and competitors' wells, and we look at those carefully. So we don't know what the thickness cutoffs are, we've got a ream of maps, but until we get out there and test it, we are forging new ground. And one of the challenges to Cimarex is most of our competition is north and east of us in an oilier part. So we're in a little different maturity fairway, and we're very encouraged by that based on our well and 1 or 2 competitor wells, but it means that we don't have a tremendous amount of analogs. The competitor wells are generally drilled in a little different oil\/gas mix. So we're going to have to sample the reservoir. It does appear to produce less water than we were expecting. I will answer your question there. Production tends to dry up a little faster than what we observed in the Woodford, for example.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","And is it a true shale or is it a mixture? Is it really deposit on base in offsetting, or is it a slope kind of thing?","John A. Lambuth","This is John. I think it kind of a -- the answer to your question depends on how you define a shale. How's that? We debate that a lot even internally, in terms of that -- if you show shale could be a matter of grain size or the fizzled nature of it. Depending upon who you ask, some would say this is a shale. Some would say, no, it's more of a dirty silt stone. Again, it depends on who you ask. What we care more about is just how do we measure it, how do we map it, and how do we prosecute it? Whatever you want to call it, that's what we're concentrating on.","Thomas E. Jorden","And Irene, I want to just trend along with John. The rock type is different, and so we don't look at this rock and just make automatic arm-waiting facing assumptions to what downspacing there may now look like. We are really early time here. We are wholly encouraged by what we've seen thus far, and we just need to keep our focus and do the work.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session.

Please go ahead.","Karen Acierno","Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2019 conference call. An updated presentation was posted to our website yesterday afternoon, and we may reference that presentation on our call today. Just as a reminder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements, a number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed.","You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements on our news release and in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today, also available is our latest 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, all those will have the risk factors associated with our business.","We will begin our prepared remarks with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden. And then Joe Albi, our COO, will update you on operations, including production and well costs. EVP of Exploration, John Lambuth, and Cimarex\u2019s CFO, Mark Burford, are here to help answer any questions.","As always and so that we can accommodate more of your questions during the hour we have allotted for the call we'd like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Feel free to get back in the queue if you like.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Jorden","Thank you, Karen, and thank you to all for joining us on the call this morning. I will briefly discuss our operational highlights and focus followed by our COO, Joe Albi, who will provide a more detailed breakdown on our quarterly details.","Cimarex had a solid third quarter in a challenging macro environment. Our oil production came in above the midpoint of our guidance range. Total oil grew 8% sequentially with Permian oil growing 6% sequentially. Permian oil growth is projected to continue.","While we plan on continuous sequential growth, occasionally we find that projects are ready to come online sooner than planned. In all cases we bring our wells online as soon as they are ready.","We lowered our capital guidance full-year by $50 million at the mid-point, while keeping our production guidance and well count unchanged, commodity prices continue to be a challenging headwind, particularly for natural gas and natural gas liquid. In spite, of these headwinds, we expect to exit the year without incremental borrowings.","Furthermore, we are pleased to be returning cash to shareholders in the form of our dividend, which we intend to continue to grow over time. We continued to deliver excellent, fully burdened returns. As we have described in the past, we measure ourselves on a fully burdened basis, which includes all drilling completion facilities, midstream land, science, and G&A.","Our well productivity and cost improvements for the past few years have resulted in robust and repeatable investment return. Our current returns are also more resilient to drops in commodity prices than they were five or six years ago. As an example, we have stress tested our total program returns for each of the three prior years, 2016, 2017 and 2018 by modeling all future cash flows as if the flat SEC prices in effect at the end of Q3 lasted forever.","Even with these low prices on a go forward basis, our total program returns are robust. Our investment performance has become repeatable, robust, and better defendable against commodity price swings. With this knowledge and confidence we're doing a better job of planning our future. We also continue to benefit from the tremendous work in science that we've put into understanding resource play development.","Our program was almost entirely development at this point. We still have a surprise or two, but we continue to gain operational confidence in our development in space and decision. We also continue to make a mistake or two along the way. This is the nature of progress. We are laser focused on all elements of our cost structure, capital expenditures and lease operating expenses.","As, we look into 2020 our plan is to generate free cash in a $50 WTI oil, $2.50 NYMEX gas environment. We will remain disciplined, cautious and flexible. We're not burdened by service contracts or undue lease expiration issues and can grow our business at the right pace for the current environment.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Joe to discuss our operations in more detail.","Joe Albi","Thank you, Tom. And thank you all for joining our call today. I'll touch on usual items, our third quarter production, our fourth quarter and full-year production guidance and then I'll finish up with a few comments on LOE and service costs.","As far as Q3 production volumes go with continued strong execution, we achieved another nice jump in our production during Q3. Our third quarter posting for net equivalent production came in at a Company record 287,000 BOEs per day, 3% above the top end of our guidance range of 265,000 to 279,000 and up 4% and 31% over Q2 2019 and Q3 2018 respectively.","The guidance beat was driven by continued strong Permian production growth and higher than forecasted NGL recoveries during the quarter","On the oil side, we posted another company record for production. Our Q3 oil volume came in at 89,700 barrels of oil per day, beating the midpoint of our guidance by 1,700 barrels a day and putting us up 8% and 40% over Q2 2019 and Q3 2018 respective postings.","Although we saw quarter to quarter oil production increases in both the Permian and the mid-continent, the Permian drove the increase with our Q3 Permian oil volume at 74,800 barrels a day up 6% over Q2 2019 and 53% over Q3 2018. With the posting the Permian now accounts for 83% of our total company oil production.","Shifting gears to capital and our full year production guidance. As Tom mentioned, through efficiency gains and cost savings, we've lowered our full year 2019 E&D capital guidance to $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. It's down $50 million or 4% at the midpoint of our previously issued guidance.","That said, we've kept our forecasted full year net completion count at 80 net wells. With our revised completion scheduling, our updated model projects our Q4 net equivalent volume to range from 272,000 to 292,000 BOEs per day, with the midpoint down just slightly from Q3 due primarily to uncertainties we have surrounding the extent of any ethane rejection that may occur during Q4.","On the oil side, we're modeling a range of 86,000 to 92,000 barrels a day with the midpoint virtually flat to Q3 and that's a byproduct of our projected 11.2 net wells coming online during in Q4, comparing to the 21.4 that we had online in Q3 and 39.5 in Q2.","So with our strong execution over the past three quarters, we're increasing our full year guidance ranges for both equivalent and oil production. We bumped our full year net equivalent production guidance to 273,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. That's up 3% at the midpoint from our guidance last call and with a range of 84,500 to 86,500 barrels of oil per day for full year net oil production. We've raised the midpoint of our guidance, our oil guidance by 500 barrels a day or approximately 1% from the range that we quoted last call.","Jumping to OpEx, we had a strong quarter for our lifting costs, our Q3 posting of $3.34 per equivalent barrel, was down 5% from Q2 and put our year-to-date lifting costs of $3.39 per BOE just slightly above the low end of our full year guidance range that we've quoted last call at $3.30 to $3.65 and represented a drop of 6% from our 2018 average of $3.62 per BOE. With the posting, we've tightened our full year lifting cost guidance to a range of $3.30 to $3.55 per BOE, lowering our midpoint by $0.05 per BOE from the range that we quoted last call.","And lastly some comments on drilling and completion costs. With the slowdown in industry activity, we're seeing cost reductions on both the drilling and completion sides. Current drilling day rates are down 5% to 9% from last call and with service cost reductions and our continued focus on frac design, we've dropped our completion AFEs by 11% to 12% from last call, which translates to a 17% to 19% drop from completion AFEs earlier in this year.","As such, we've realized sizable drops in our projected total well costs during the quarter. In our Wolfcamp program, as an example, cost reductions have dropped our generic Reeves County 2-mile Wolfcamp A AFE to $9.3 million to $11.8 million, again depending on facility design and frac logistics. That range is down $700,000 from our estimate last call, $1.1 million from earlier this year and down $1.6 million from our estimate late last year. Our shallower Wolfcamp A wells in Culberson County are running about $500,000 less than this range with an AFE range of $8.8 million to $11.1 million, efficiency gains that we derived through our multi-well development drilling projects, as we've talked about before put our average development well, total well costs at the low end of these ranges.","And in the Mid-Continent, our refined completion design, improved operating efficiencies and service cost reductions, combined have reduced our AFEs in both our Woodford and our Meramec programs. For example, our current 2-mile Meramec AFE is running $8.5 million to $10 million. That's down $1 million from last call, $1.5 million from earlier this year and $3 million from the cost that we quoted in early 2008.","So as Tom mentioned, we've made tremendous strides in our cost structure, particularly on the total well cost side and it really is showing up in our statistics. Through operation efficiencies, realized cost reductions and by drilling longer laterals, our 2019 Permian program total well cost per lateral foot metric is estimated at $1,150 to $1,200. Now this estimate includes all necessary costs to bring well online, drilling, stimulation, facility and flow-back cost, and it implies a 20% reduction over that same metric that we saw in 2018.","So in closing, we had a great Q3. We executed on the strong production ramp, we promised and forecasted with equivalent and oil production guidance speaks along the way. We've raised the midpoint of both our full year net oil and equivalent production ranges with resulting year-over-year growth of 26% and 24% for net oil and net equivalent volumes respectively.","Our cost structure is strong. Our Q3 lifting cost was down 5% from Q2 and we've lowered the midpoint of our full year guidance by $0.05 per BOE. We've lowered our total well costs significantly with our average Permian total well cost metric in the $1,150 to $1,200 per lateral foot range, down 20% from 2018 levels. We're executing on all cylinders and we're well positioned to deliver on the capital, the activity and production plan that we put in place at the beginning of the year.","So with that, I'll open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gabe Daoud with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Gabe Daoud","Hey, good morning everyone. Appreciate all the prepared remarks and the high level framework on 2020. I guess, wondering if you could just give us a sense on assumed Permian activity levels for the range of oil prices that you give, whether that's in terms of rigs, crews or turn-in-lines. And then I guess, what kind of overall growth do you see for corporate oil production next year?","Mark Burford","Yes. Hi, Gabe, this is Mark. Yes. For 2020, we're still working on our plans and we don't have a lot of \u2013 we want to give a lot of detail on the plan in the 2020. Recurring eight rigs in the Permian, we have some plans that we'd actually increase from that rig count in the 2020 in our current forecasting the scenarios we're running. And in turn-in-lines with the cycle time for seeing our turn-in-lines have improved with the compressed cycle times. So the different scenarios we're working on at 2020, we are seeing activity, that\u2019s a good pace activity into 2020 and we're focused on that Permian oil growth and we're forecasting growth into 2020.","Gabe Daoud","Understood. Thanks Mark. And I guess as a follow-up, I think this year you had some exploration spend in the budget and just I guess as a way to maximize free cash flow next year. Do you think that comes out of the budget and then I guess, if you could maybe even just quantify that number of exploration spend that was in the budget for this year? Thanks guys.","John Lambuth","Yes, this is John Lambuth. We did have some exploration spend, but again, it's not that much money in regards to 2019. When we do have a land effort, usually we're very early entrant, thus our entry costs are extremely low. So you really don't even see it within the overall capital framework. So it's not something \u2013 and I think one needs to worry too much about in terms of our capital plans for the following year.","Tom Jorden","We track that very closely, as a percentage of our total capital. That's a metric, with our focus on fully-burdened returns that we've watched from the inception of Cimarex. We haven't budgeted tremendous amount for exploration. I'm hoping that we're going to find some things that we love and we should have plenty of room there.","Gabe Daoud","Great. Thanks Tom. Thanks everyone.","Operator","The next question is from Arun Jayaram with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","Yes, good morning. Tom, I was wondering if you could comment your thoughts around risk associated with your federal acreage position as we approach an election year. And have you had any conversations with the governor of New Mexico and just general thoughts around that risk of which has been evident since some tweets in early September?","Operator","Pardon me. It appears that we may have lost connection with the main speaker line. I'm going to put the call on hold and try and reconnect. One moment please.","Pardon me. This is the conference operator. We have reconnected with the main speaker location and I'm going to join Arun in backend for his question as well. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","Tom, can you hear me?","Tom Jorden","I can. Thank you.","Arun Jayaram","Okay. Did you hear my question on federal acreage, if not, I could restate it?","Tom Jorden","Yes. No, we did not. We lost the connection, but can you please restate?","Arun Jayaram","Okay, great. Tom, I wanted to get your thoughts on potential risk around Cimarex\u2019s state federal \u2013 pardon me, your federal acreage position in the Permian as we approach the election year. Have you had any conversations with the governor or officials in New Mexico and how do you think about that risk on a go-forward basis?","Tom Jorden","Well, a lot of questions there, Arun but certainly, Cimarex has been engaged with the governor and such. I have not personally discussed this issue with the governor. Here's how I think about the risk. We're in a primary season and as always in the primary season, some ideas get floated that are a bit extreme. I mean, if you go back four years and watch either the democratic or the Republican debates, I think you'll make that observation. We are certainly exposed to New Mexico. I mean, we've been very forthcoming on that.","We don't think that there is going to be a ban on fracking on federal lands. We are nicely positioned for Texas as well. So even if it were to happen or there to be some discussion around that, we've got plenty of places to adjust and move to. But I'll just close by saying federal royalties are such a huge part of the state of New Mexico's total revenue stream that I cannot imagine a situation where the federal government would close that door on New Mexico. But we will be prepared either way with flexibility in our program.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And just my follow-up, Tom, going back to Gabe\u2019s question, Slide 19, you've highlighted different free cash flow yields in a 2020 program from 50 to 60. I was wondering is at the lower end of that band, would you still anticipate growing some oil next year or would that resemble more of a maintenance program based on the initial forecast?","Tom Jorden","No. We grow oil under all those scenarios.","Arun Jayaram","Great. Thanks a lot, Tom.","Operator","The next question is from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning. First question I had was just pertaining to, can you talk about a little bit just on your Delaware plans by county? It looks like most continued to be for 2019 in Culberson. I'm just wondering, I know fully understand you don't have the detailed 2020 out yet. Maybe just talk a little bit about if the area of focus would be relatively similar.","Tom Jorden","Well, I would say, it will be relatively similar. We're always going to have a very healthy level of activity in Culberson with our joint development agreement with Chevron. We've a lot of projects we like in Eddy County, lot of projects in Lea County. But Reeves County also has a lot of activity. We're getting after that resolute acreage in addition to the acreage we brought to the table and we're going to be active really across our portfolio.","Neal Dingmann","Okay, and then one just follow-up. Thanks Tom. Just look like for 2019, you had about $70 million budget for midstream. Again, knowing for a while you don't have detailed 2020. Just on average do you think the spend for, I would just say non-D&C will continue to be about the same or will that start to trickle down a bit?","Tom Jorden","Well, this year anticipated to be 70 or maybe slightly below and then as we move into 2020, our focus is going to be on trying to capitalize on the infrastructure that we have and minimize any midstream associated costs that would be tied to our development programs.","Neal Dingmann","Pretty good. Thank you all.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Scialla with Stifel. Please go ahead","Mike Scialla","Hey, good morning everybody and congrats on the quarter. Tom, you said that $50 a case with the 2% free cash flow yield that you still grow oil. I just want to see if you could provide maintenance capital level that you need to spend to keep your oil flat, say with the projected fourth quarter rate?","Tom Jorden","Yes, I'm going to bounce pass that to Mark. We \u2013 I don't know if we've calculated that fresh.","Mark Burford","Yes. Mike, we know we haven't calculated that fresh. We're working on 2020 plan right now, which does anticipate growth in our oil. And we're working in allocation, we\u2019re allocating into 2020, as we\u2019re currently looking at it, even a greater portion of our capital going to the Permian, but we don't have \u2013 I don't have a maintenance capital associated with that. But that yield that we're talking is solely under 2% and nearly 10% is a scenario there. Some of the scenarios that we're working on with these \u2013 steady to slightly down, D&C capital. It derives that type of yield and it's basically kind of anticipating budgeting of that 50 and 250 type NYMEX oil and gas price with this \u2013 and again as steady slide down capital, holding that flat and running that through the year.","Mike Scialla","No problem. Okay. And then the 250 gas price because we're looking at Waha price is still below a dollar. Even with the Gulf Coast Express online. I assume that's what you had mentioned earlier in your prepared remarks, that you're using the kind of the current price is so flat. How does that I guess impact your thinking about your plans for 2020 or does it?","Tom Jorden","Well, those NYMEX prices are always, we quote that because that's the index marker, but we bring that back to our actual received price at the wellhead. So we're accounting for all of those basis differentials only in our go-forward plans. Mark, you want to touch on that?","Mark Burford","Yes, that's right, Mike. So Mike, we learn different flat cases or even price it \u2013 the current forward strip for 2020 is right around 250, I think its 252 last Friday. So it's fairly close to the flat price NYMEX price we're using. But to the extent, we adjust from a \u2013 to a flat case from the strip case, we keep it fortunately reduced the realized prices in areas where the local market differentials based on the forward curve of those differential. So we bake \u2013 fully bake in all those differential.","Tom Jorden","So our cash flow fully incorporates the local pricing for all products.","Mark Burford","Yes, for gas and NGL. That's right.","Mike Scialla","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. Slide 8 illustrated that the second quarter of 2019 contained half of the entire 2019 timelines. And then activity trailed off in the second half. Since 2020 becomes a year of potentially meaningful free cash generation. I was wondering if you're going to follow us somewhere operational plan as you did in 2019 or would you prefer to make the free cash generation more level-loaded throughout the year?","Tom Jorden","Well, I'll start this off and then let Mark comment. Ideally, we would love if it were level-loaded across the platform, but with eight rigs running and these development projects, there is a certain structure to when we bring these wells online. And this is just our business. We are making a good attempt to try to smooth out these field operations to try to have a more even field cadence. But I want to just be clear, our primary goal is to generate outstanding returns on invested capital, stress tests those returns for the downside and make sure that we account for every single cost incurred in bringing that production online.","The production timing is a consequence of good decisions and not a primary driver. Yes, we'd love for this to be smooth and even but the world doesn\u2019t always behave that way with these development projects. Mark, you want to touch on that?","Mark Burford","Yes, absolutely, Tom. Just echo what you're saying and the fact that the number of wells brought on into production in any particular quarter can be varied by size of pads we\u2019re drilling in a different development. The pace of development that we're drilling for wells, I don't see completed per quarter is much more consistent. And our operational cadence is what we are focused on is operational cadence of our activities in drilling or completing our laterals and drilling our wells.","And then the timing of these well productivity that we brought on, bring any quarter will be vary depending on, again, the size of the pad. The areas that we're drilling and even can vary somewhat that the working interest that we have in the areas we're bringing on since this is a net well completion per quarter. We are definitely focused on our operational cadence and our well lateral feet drilled per quarter and again, the quarterly production cadence of wells brought online can be more - look more erratic than what the underlying operations represent.","Tom Jorden","Yes. And I want to make one other comment. We're focused on costs. I said in my opening remarks, that is a laser focus of ours. And to smooth out that could be done, but it could involve significant costs, mobilization costs, getting enough water on pad as you need it. And so there are a lot of other considerations but we are \u2013 that sound like a broken record here. We are driven by returns on invested capital. Joe, you want to comment on that?","Joe Albi","Yes, I do. I wanted to use this year as an example of this completion cadence that both Mark and Tom were talking about. If you look back over the year and I'm going to talk about multi-well projects in the Permian. In Q2, we had two multi-well projects on a gross basis and there only were two wells per project and that was four net wells \u2013 four total gross wells for the quarter. In Q2, we had six multi-well projects that range anywhere from two to seven wells per project and on the average, there were five wells for every one of those projects.","So in Q2, these six projects brought on 30 wells, in Q3 five projects brought on 21 wells. And as we go into Q4, two of these projects are bringing on 12 wells. As I mentioned in my opening statements, that's really the byproduct of our flat oil production here in Q4. So we're always going to have some semblance of that completion cadence and our production growth.","Jeffrey Campbell","I really appreciate the color and I think your points are fair and then probably what we should end up doing is thing you have free cash on an annualized basis rather than getting to hung up on sequential. But I thought it was fair question to ask.","Tom Jorden","It\u2019s a totally fair question. And we look at this, I was on a call early this morning on just this topic. And I was convinced that by spreading it out further, we get better returns and lower cost structure so that it's a really fair question. We welcome the question. But some of this is just details that ironing a program out, sometimes the chips fall in a non-ideal way. I'll just leave it there.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay. As my follow-up on Slide 28, it references Cimarex\u2019s two gas gathering systems and Slide 29 illustrates the water management system. I was just wondering, is the longer term view to keep these assets in-house for cost control since you guys mentioned, you're very focused on costs or could you sell them and still have an advantaged cost structure.","Tom Jorden","That's a very pertinent question to us because as we've discussed in prior calls, this is something that is an active subject of investigation. We've done a lot of work over the last quarter on this. We certainly have a very valuable gas gathering system and a very valuable water gathering system. I will tell you that we have and continue to explore monetization options, but it really is a trade-off between a quick hit of cash when you monetize versus the longer term increased operating expenses.","If I were surprised by anything, even at today's multiples, it's not an obvious decision. You can sell them, take the cash now, which you're going to pay for it in perpetuity with higher operating costs. We think we've got one of the lowest cost structures around. We realized that that cost structure is a real asset of ours. Gathering system, both for gas and water provides us tremendous operational flexibility.","So although, we continue to explore that, we have conversations on this every day. I will say that for now, we have not made a commitment to monetize these assets. It's an active argument at Cimarex. It's a healthy argument. But it's pay me now or pay me later type choice.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, great. I appreciate that color. And again, congratulations on the quarter.","Tom Jorden","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Noel Parks with Coker Palmer. Please go ahead.","Noel Parks","Good morning. I just had a couple of questions. Thinking about Culberson County and the economics out there, also thinking about gas and NGL issues that the whole industry has had. How sensitive do you consider the Culberson County economics to sort of the uncertainty around the takeaway and processing part of the equation? Just sort of thinking, there's that piece of \u2013 and of course, the demand piece for the products that also it fluctuate for a while with NGL.","Tom Jorden","Well, we don't see uncertainty in takeaway of processing. We've got that system with multiple outlets for takeaway. We have multiple outlets for processing. And I\u2019ll let Joe comment on this, but our operations and marketing group had done a tremendous job when we've had occasional interruptions with our processors or gatherers, transporters. We've been able to very adeptly redirect that flow because we do control that asset from a gathering standpoint and we have multiple outlets.","Oil is the dominant phase, dominant revenue phase of Culberson County. I wish gas and NGLs were stronger revenue component, but even at current pricing with this hostile price environment, the economics of Culberson County are supremely attractive to us. And, we just see upside to pricing. If, we can make the kind of returns we're making now, it's just only going to get better if we see any kind of recovery in gas and NGL pricing.","I mean, those economics \u2013 I appreciate your question because I think the economics of Culberson County are under appreciated. Not only is Culberson County as we demonstrate in our slide, one of the premier counties for cumulative oil production, but we deliver that oil at a basin wide low operating costs because of the nature of that reservoir and the low operating cost of our system. So we're pretty pleased with that asset.","Joe, you want to comment on that?","Joe Albi","As far as takeaway goes, Tom hit it right on the head as far as the value to the infrastructure kind of leads into the prior question. A Triple Crown is an example we have a large system for gas gathering, which can offload to four or five different processors at any point in time.","We see adequate processing capacity in the Delaware to handle not only our gas but majority of the basins gas in the near term. As far as NGL takeaways concern, we're linking our sales to those owners of the production facilities who have pipe out of the basin.","On the oil side, we're doing the same thing. 85% of our oils on pipe or we\u2019re signed to purchasers who can get us out of the basin. And on the gas side, as we've talked about the residue gas side, we\u2019ve secured sales of gas, our gas through 2020 a 100% through the first quarter, which is committed to be sold and we've got 75% on the average over the remainder of 2020 that's committed to purchasers. All the while we secured a takeaway on WhiteWater to get to WAHA. And also I think in our earnings presentation you'll see that we've committed to Whistler. So we're, long-term thinking and it's all about getting that base and getting that product out of basin.","Noel Parks","Great. Thanks. And my other question, I was just curious have you seen any significant change in the leasing environment in the Woodford Meramec over the past few months or so?","John Lambuth","This is John. Well certainly there's a lot less activity within the whole stack play and then yes, I think it's fair to say not as much in terms of competition if one's looking for that incremental acreage. So yes, thanks, that slowed down definitely in that pace current day.","Tom Jorden","One change I've observed is because so many of our competitors are tasked with living within their cash flow. There are a lot of operators that are looking to sell non-operated interest, a number of operators because they're sticking to that discipline of living within their cash flow, find that they only have the cash flow to participate in their own operator properties.","So, we've had some pretty good opportunities in the Anadarko and in the Delaware basin to pick up additional interest in some of our projects at costs that quite frankly we haven't seen in years.","Noel Parks","Terrific. And just to clarify, are those things that are people actively approaching you or you're just aware as you see people going on consent that there might be an issue?","John Lambuth","It runs the gamut. Mainly it's just they make it aware that they are looking to get out of the wells if we're operating at something that we make an offer. Sometimes it is at poolings where we get it through the pooling. It varies but as Tom alluded to, there is quite a few operators who to stay within that budget, they are getting out from a non-op perspective. So we've gone very well in picking out some of the additional interests.","Tom Jorden","As an interesting aside and a statement of how free markets function, private equity has come out of the woodwork on this subject. Private equity is highly attuned to this opportunity and the number of private equity players are actively soliciting relationships where they will pick up this non-operated interest if operators don't want to participate. So there's a little market that's developing for this. But it's, it's a change in our business. We wouldn't have seen this a few years ago.","Noel Parks","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question is from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Drew Venker","Good morning. Tom, you've talked a lot about maximizing NPV and rates return and clearly as you talked about 2020, free cash flow is another important aspect. Can you talk about how spacing might play into your optimization of returns versus NPV in the current commodity price backdrop as you said, it's kind of harsh at this point. But I think especially given that you have probably as good of an understanding of spacing and downhole well geometries as anybody.","Tom Jorden","Well, I appreciate that question Drew. We've talked about this at length and we love talking about it because we live it every day. We see the spacing decision as a trade-off and a natural interplay between rate of return and net present value. And we have these discussions every day. In fact, I had a discussion this morning on a spacing project where we made it clear to one another and to our operating group that we will not spend money to bring on non-economic production.","At least I'll say we won't do it on purpose. And so studying these projects and understanding where your break over point is and when you should stop down spacing is really an important element. So we seek to not be wasteful by having our wells too coarsely spaced and we seek to not be wasteful by having our wells too tightly spaced. And they are a waste of both sides of that. It's not a one size fits all. It changes from area to area. It changes from reservoir to reservoir. And I'll just say I've tremendous confidence in our team in our approach in understanding the science behind this.","John leads that effort and as I said in my opening remarks, we make mistakes. We're not perfect on this subject and yet I really am confident in saying that we are continuously getting better. You want to comment on this, John?","John Lambuth","Well, just as a follow up, I would emphasize what Tom said, not one size fits all. We definitely see variations in our spacing thoughts, even within the Wolfcamp as we fill across our acreage from Culberson to Reeves to Lea and on it. And, there's so many dynamics in there, but we have a very good understanding of it that we're able to adjust on a section level basis to come up with the proper spacing. So, I feel very good about what we'll be able to do in 2020, in terms of development projects we currently have planned and the appropriate spacing for it ","Drew Venker","Thanks for the detail was just thinking just as a follow-up to that, if you're using 2019 as a starting point and point of comparison, if you're, if we end-up being at the lower end of this $50 to $60 price range you laid out for 2020 does that generally bias you towards wider spacing? And then conversely, if we're at 60 tighter spacing?","Tom Jorden","We've run those models and we've looked at not only commodity pricing but also net revenue interest and I will say that our experience is that the boundary on over spacing can be so punitive that it's not really going to change within the price file that you just quoted that I would not see us at a $60 or even $70 oil price making different spacing decisions.","Drew Venker","Thanks Tom.","Operator","The next question is from Betty Jiang with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Betty Jiang","Good morning. I have two questions on cost. First on CapEx. There has just been tremendous progress this year cutting the Permian well cost by a 20% year-on-year. Just wanting to understand are there additional levers to move that 1,150 to 1,200 per foot cost even lower as we look out to 2020. And are there any of that being reflected in the preliminary free cash flow outlook?","Joe Albi","Hi, Betty, this is Joe. We're constantly looking at how we can become more and more efficient. A lot of the recent drop that we've seen has come as a result of service cost reductions on the completion side. We're pushing hard to optimize efficiencies and combine some of our midstream efforts and contractors into laying the flow lines for our wells to the midstream systems. As an example, we're looking at our battery design so that we could produce more wells into a battery and potentially apply a drill to fill type of strategy to optimize our completion costs.","So it's hard for me to give you, hey we can reduce it by X, but I will tell you that it is a strong emphasis around his company right now that costs are relevant in this price environment and in order for us to really be a top performer. So it's our focus.","Mark Burford","Yes, Betty as far as it being forecasted into 2020 our typical practice is to kind of use the current AFE that we have in hand, kind of our current cost structure and not to make assumptions on better \u2013 further improvements from there even though there's potential for that.","Tom Jorden","Let me join the chorus here. We want to fairly and transparently report our costs. We think the focus on cost for lateral foot is a good focus. That said Cimarex operates over a fairly wide geographic range within the basin and our costs will vary significantly across the basin. We have some development projects in Culberson County that all in are below $1,000 a foot. And we're averaging that with some projects in the deep basin where you have a little more pressure and a little more drilling and completion challenges that that average that number up.","We also have some one mile wells in our portfolio, although on average we're certainly going to longer and longer laterals as shown in our deck. But I don't want to discourage our teams from bringing forward one mile projects that have outstanding returns. And so, you know, we're going to continue to report a transparent average, but within that average there's a lot of structure.","Betty Jiang","Got it. Now, that's really helpful color. Thank you for that. And then similarly on the other costs item LOEs ease, I mean historically oilier production growth typically put upward pressure on cost, but that has not been the case for you guys this year, going forward how should we expect LOE to evolve as your growing oil production in the Permian by seeing declining gas production out of Mid-Con? So do you think there is a bit more room on the LOE to come down on the per unit basis?","Joe Albi","This is Joe again. This quarter we saw a nice reduction in our overall absolute LOE. I even with the resolute assets, coming on board tail end of Q1 we were down on the LOE side, but our work over expense was up and that's a result of converting to live. So there's a lot of wells to live. So, there's a lot of variables in that number because they've got the day to day LOE costs to operate the wells and then you've got the work over expenses that slide into that category as well.","Our focus is going to remain on the same items we are now, the bigger emphasis is going to be on SWD or salt water disposal. That's where the majority of our cost reductions have been achieved and it's we\u2019re going forward. We\u2019re going to be able to take advantage of them.","That's where that infrastructure that keeps popping its head up comes into play. The optionality and the cost optimization of the systems provide us, allow us to swing water to use for our fracs. And at the same time we're using that water for a fracs we're not having to incur in and kind of electrical charges to the SWD wells to dispose it and although that sounds like a small item that can add up, so that's where those efficiencies have been coming from and that's where our focus is going to be going forward.","Tom Jorden","Yes. Betty, I'll just add on, we kind of highlight some are Culberson County, lease operating expense per barrel. In that County we\u2019re close to $2 a barrel on production spend. In the total Permian we\u2019re only about $3.50, in this quarter reported $3.34 cents per barrel on our production expense per barrel equivalent. As we look into 2020 a blending of the Permian Anadarko, we still expect to have a very competitive cost structure even with the Permian growing more rapidly.","Betty Jiang","Got it. Now this is really helpful.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Downey with Citi Group. Please go ahead.","Brian Downey","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one for me. I believe you had recently tried an e-frac completion, just wanted to confirm that that was correct. And any color you could provide on cost-saving uptime versus conventional or stage efficiencies, I realized that maybe a small sample size of any \u2013 curious on any comments and if you have future plans to continue using them when available.","Tom Jorden","Yes, we did just finish one trial completion on two wells and we have not finalized all the costs associated with it. So we\u2019re \u2013 early for me to tell you the efficiencies that we may or may not have achieved with that operation. But we tried it because we want to learn more and we are working with our main service provider to see how we may be able to better utilize the infrastructure and the electrical infrastructure that we have in particular in Triple Crown in the near to distant future. Transition ourselves into that realm, not only for cost savings but also from an emission standpoint. We see tremendous benefit to cut in any kind of emissions that would be associated with fracs","Brian Downey","Now. So does that mean you're using the electric infrastructure within the field or are you still using the field gas or I guess what would be the plan going forward?","Tom Jorden","In this case the frac that we tried was using fuel source not coming from our transmission lines a CMG, but going forward, what we're really seeing that the true economic benefit where, where we see at the end is being able to provide our own power off our own grid and that could substantially, we believe lower the cost to do the new frac.","John Lambuth","We own our own electrical distribution systems at Culberson County and in our Reeves County and like many others have used that's probably where electrification will ultimately go rather than towing a power plant around the oil field, it probably makes more sense to have a power source that\u2019s stationary and just equipment that's mobile. We're studying this problem hard. We have a team digging into it. We're looking for some long range solutions and like so many things that we study hard, they look a lot simpler to us. The less we know about it. And as we learn more and more it becomes more complex. But we're convinced that this is a long-term direction that we want to go in and we're hard at work just understanding the problem.","Brian Downey","That's helpful. I appreciate the color. Thanks everyone.","Operator","The next question is from Nitin Kumar with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Nitin Kumar","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one. I was looking at the Reeves County acreage in your latest presentation on Slide 12, it seems to be a slight drop of about 13,000 acres. Could you help us understand what happened there?","Tom Jorden","Yes. if you look at our Reeves County map, there's some acreage in the far south of the County that was an exploration play that we embarked upon a few years ago. It's actually off the map on slide 12. We don't carry any locations on that acre currently, we never have. And some of it was due to expire and we let it expire. We just couldn't make economic wells there. You want to add to that, John?","John Lambuth","We couldn't make a payment.","Nitin Kumar","So suffice it to say it didn't meet the cost threshold. I guess a broader question Tom, in the past you've talked about the optionality and kind of having two basins, as I look at the initial guidance, clearly you're favoring the Permian and I get it why, but how far is the Mid-Con today for competing within your capital program?","Tom Jorden","Well, there we could easily put 30% or more of our capital in the Mid-Con next year and that would be opportunities that compete heads up. We have a lot of things in the Midcontinent that are competitive in today's environment. That said, as we've discussed in the past, we are in a, let's pull back and see what we can accomplish from an asset growth standpoint in the Midcontinent. John and his team are hard at work looking for new areas and new landing zones and we'd like to just beef-up that asset and have it compete longer term. Do you want to comment on that, John?","John Lambuth","The only thing I'd add is it is just what we're looking for is more depth to that inventory. So there's more sustainability to it. So we're putting a lot of effort to not just looking across our existing acres positions that we have. And then furthermore, looking beyond that because as someone said earlier in a call there are opportunities now and we're just looking for where are those opportunities where we think we have maybe an advantage to get at and maybe at a reasonable and bring forth things that would compete for capital. So that's kind of where we're at right now with the Anadarko base.","Nitin Kumar","Thank you. Gentlemen.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Jorden for any closing remarks.","Tom Jorden","Yes, I want to thank everybody for participating.

My name is Tony, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter Earnings and Operation Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Burford, you may begin your conference.","Mark Burford","Thank you very much, Tony, and welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today on our second quarter conference call. Here in Denver, we have Tom Jorden, President and CEO; Joe Albi, EVP and COO; Paul Korus, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Jim Shonsey, Vice President and Controller.","We did issue our financial and operating results and news release this morning, a copy of which can be found on our website. I need to remind you that today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. However, a number of factors could cause the actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosure on the forward-looking statements in our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases for risk factors associated with our business.","Thank you very much for joining us, and I'll just go ahead and turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Jorden","Thanks, Mark, and welcome, everyone. We had a solid second quarter even with falling commodity prices. As you saw from our release, we reported net income of $64.3 million or $0.74 per diluted share. Our adjusted cash flow from operations this quarter was $240 million, and that's down from $340 million last year.","Our second quarter 2012 production volumes averaged 590 million cubic feet equivalent per day, that's up slightly from a year ago of 585.7 million cubic feet equivalent. We continue to see strong growth in the Permian and Mid-Continent, which, combined, averaged 547.7 million cubic feet per day -- cubic feet equivalent per day, growing 17% over last year. And that includes a 37% increase from Permian Basin oil volumes, which averaged 21,694 barrels of oil per day this quarter. Our total company oil production grew 8% to 28,000, 686,000 -- 28,686 barrels per day. Liquids accounted for 46% of our equivalent volumes and 80% of our 343 million of oil, gas and NGL revenue.","We saw a decrease in oil, gas and NGL prices this quarter compared to last year, and that didn't surprise anybody. Oil price realizations decreased 12% to $87.81 per barrel. Natural gas prices fell 49%, averaging $2.42 per Mcf. And NGL prices fell $0.36 to average $29.02 per barrel.","What we can control is going very well. We're seeing excellent results in our Permian drilling program, and our Cana team is doing a fantastic job, making returns in a difficult natural gas and NGL environment.","And I just want to say to underscore that, for those of you who have seen our production table and our area-by-area break down, we've had a tremendous headwind to overcome this year with our Gulf Coast decline, and we've talked about that, ad infinitum in past calls. And I just want to tell you how deeply proud we are here in the executive team of our organization, that's picked up the pace, and the fact that we've overcome that decline in the Gulf Coast is really a testament to our engine of growth we have in that Permian and Mid-Continent program, both our exploration team, our operations team working together, our marketing team. We've had a lot of very difficult challenges so far this year with plant downtimes, and Joe will get into that in some detail. Our core focus is on execution, being good at the business and working our way through the cycles.  And we're very proud to report the way this organization has responded to the cycle we're in so far this year.","In the first half of this year, we've drilled 160 gross, 91 net wells, investing $782 million on exploration development. Of our total expenditures, 52% were invested in projects located in the Permian, 44% in the Mid-Continent and 4% in the Gulf Coast and other.","And now, we'll move on and give a region-by-region summary, and I'll start with the Permian, which of course is our largest area. We drilled and completed 94 gross or 64 net Permian Basin wells during the first 6 months of 2012, completing 95% of those as producers.","Permian E&D capital for the first half was $409 million or 52% of our total capital. Year-to-date, 2012, in our New Mexico Bone Spring program, we drilled and completed 31 gross, 16 net wells, and we're continuing to see outstanding results in that play. Per well, 30-day gross production from the 2012 Bone Spring wells averaged over 600 barrels equivalent per day, 87% of which was oil. We're drilling some of the best wells we've ever seen.  Not only are we drilling some very nice wells, we're certainly in the process of, I think, demonstrating to people that we've overcome some of the challenges we had in the last year with high water cuts. A lot of these wells are in extensional new areas, and we're very, very pleased with the results we're seeing out of that program.","Our team has done a great job in this program, maximizing well performance and stepping out in some of these new areas.","Moving onto the Texas Third Bone Spring. Our Texas Third Bone spring drilling this year has totaled 19 gross and 12 net wells. The per well 30-day gross production rate in this year's wells have averaged 850 barrels equivalent per day, 79% of that being oil. Really nice results out of that program.","And then finally, in the Permian, I'd like to update you on where we are in our Wolfcamp play. We're continuing to see strong results from our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp shale drilling. And as we've outlined in the past, our Wolfcamp play is focused in Southern Eddy County, New Mexico, we call that our White City program, and Northern Culberson County, Texas, where we have approximately 80,000 net acres. Year-to-date, we have drilled and completed 6 gross or 5.9 net horizontal Wolfcamp wells, bringing our total wells in the play since inception to 24 gross or 22.7 net.","Our per well first 30-day production from the wells brought on this quarter averaged 6.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 1,120 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That stream out of the Wolfcamp is comprised of 2.6 million cubic feet a day of gas and, of course, I'm quoting the 30-day averages of our first quarter. So the average is 2.6 million cubic feet a day gas, 345 barrels per day of oil and 335 barrels per day of natural gas liquids, or that's 39% gas, 31% oil and 30% NGL.","We've done a lot of experimenting, both regional and stratigraphically, to see if we can increase that oil yield. I will say that our most recent wells are seeing a fairly significant increase in our oil yield. Our play average is about 55 barrels per million. Our recent wells are coming in at about 70 barrels per million. We're still de-risking our acreage. We've yet to fully define on that play. We're still drilling one well per section, and so there's a lot we don't know about that play.  We don't know the full regional extent. We don't know the yield breakdown once we have our acreage entirely de-risked. We also don't know how many wells per section ultimately this play will generate for us. But what we do know is we're seeing very nice results, we're getting reasonable returns even at today's costs and commodity pricing environment and we're very excited about this play for what it will be for us in 2012, 2013 and as a legacy project for Cimarex.","Our per well first 30-day production rates in all the wells we've drilled to date, and that's from soup to nuts, short laterals, long laterals, high costs, bad completions, good completions, 30-day average for everything, no holds barred, 6.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day. And again, that's comprised of 2.8 million cubic feet equivalent gas, 270 barrels per day of oil and 350 barrels per day of natural gas liquids. So that's 43% gas, 25% oil and 32% natural gas liquids.","So again, we don't know the scope of this play. We certainly think it has many, many years of drilling potential for us as we de-risk our acreage. And then, we need to ultimately determine our spacing, whether it will be 80-acre spacing, 160-acre spacing or some other number, as yet, we don't know. But certainly, that play has earned a slot in our highlights reel.","Moving on to the Mid-Continent. In the first half of 2012, we drilled and completed 64 gross or 26 net Mid-Continent wells, and our Mid-Continent first half exploration development capital was $345 million or 44% of our total capital. And essentially, all of that activity year-to-date has been in our Cana-Woodford, where we've drilled and completed 60 gross or 25 net wells. At quarter end, there were 57 gross and 24 net Cana wells waiting on completion, and that compares with 13 gross or 4.9 net wells waiting on completion at year-end 2011.","So we're building a little bit of a backlog in Cana, and that's purely a function of our infill development program, and that our drilling is outpacing our completion. That increase on waiting on completions as compared to year end is something that will be with us for a while as we're completing these wells. Frac-ing in our infill row started on May 23, flowback of the first well began in late June and first sale started mid-July. So we don't yet have 30 days of a flowback on our infill program.","So we're now in the manufacturing process in Cana. We have a frac crew working continuously, working their way down the 7-section infill row that we're currently completing and we're completing a frac job every 3 to 4 days. It's a great project. We've put a lot of energy into infrastructure, both from gathering systems, water, water disposal. And I'm sure Joe will talk about that in some detail. And we're still seeing reasonable returns. At current costs and current strip pricing, our returns -- when we quote returns on an infill project, it's an east-west row. All of these infill rows will be east-west, and so east-west in the core Cana goes from a more liquids rich to a drier portion. So the liquids rich has the higher rates return, the drier portion has a lower rates return. And in that row, those rates return vary from 18% to 40% after tax on our drilling dollars, current cost, current pricing.","So we're still seeing successful rates of return at Cana. It's turning into a manufacturing project. We currently have 7 rigs running in Cana. As we've talked in the past, we're planning on redirecting some of those rigs to some other oilier or Mid-Continent plays that we're testing. We're still in a bit of a state of flux. We moved some of our Cana rigs to the Permian as we redirected our capital. Our current plan, if things unfold as the way we currently see them, is we would ramp down our Cana fleet to 4 rigs and exit the year with 4 rigs, working on that infill row in Cana or additional infill drilling in Cana.","We also are experimenting with long laterals in Cana. There have been a number of long laterals drilled by the industry in the Cana core. We have a history of -- there are currently 3 laterals by other operators they are currently producing. There's one flowing back, and then there are spattering of others. We have drilled our first long lateral. We are waiting on completion there. We didn't get the entire lateral length down, so we're still -- don't have anything definitive to say in our opinion of the role of long laterals in Cana, but we are experimenting with them.","Elsewhere in the Mid-Continent, we're quite pleased. We've talked in the past about some emerging plays in the Mid-Continent. We'll be testing some ideas. We've got some ideas that we are in process of testing and in a talk going on in Cleveland. We have some other ideas we haven't talked about and we'll be testing them soon. And hopefully, in the next call or 2, we'll be able to give you some results and what kind of exposure those may have for us going forward.","In the Gulf Coast, we began prospecting on a new 3D shoot that we recently got off the field. We have some new data in our processing. We're trying to see what kind of inventory we'll build. We don't have a definitive look at that yet, so that will be an update for further calls.","So just in conclusion, as we look at our results today, where we are, where we're going, it's been a solid first half. We focused on execution. We're very pleased with where we are. We're right on target to deliver the guidance that we've promised. And I just want to reiterate again that we're very proud of the operational and overall performance of our organization as they've had to overcome a fair amount of headwind this year.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph R. Albi","Thank you, Tom, and thank you all of you for joining our call today. I'll quickly touch on our second quarter production, hit on our remaining year guidance and then I'll finish up with a few comments on where we see service costs.","Despite seeing higher pipeline and facility shut-in volumes than we expected, our second quarter average net daily equivalent production came in at 590.1 million a day. That's about as expected and right at the midpoint of our guidance that we issued of 580 million to 680 million a day. As you may recall from our last call, our Q2 guidance incorporated a reduction of approximately 10 million to 12 million a day for what we saw as anticipated Permian and Mid-Continent pipeline and facility shut-ins, as well as the likely ethane rejection during May and June for our processed gas out in Cana.","When the dust settled after we closed the quarter, our plus or minus 3-million-a-day estimate for the Q2 impact for ethane rejection was right in line, but our facility shut-ins ended up being slightly higher than we anticipated, primarily in the Permian. And as a result, our production was negatively impacted to the tune of 17 million to 19 million a day during the quarter versus the 10 million to 12 million that we have predicted. Nonetheless, we came in right at our midpoint. And when accounting for those shut-ins, we're about flat or possibly even a little bit higher than where we would have been in Q1.","We continued to set new records in the Permian, although 12 million to 13 million a day of our second quarter shut-ins did happen in the Permian. Our reported net equivalent Permian production of 247 million a day is a new high mark for the region, as is our 28,011 barrels per day of total liquid production.","As compared to Q1 '12, our second quarter combined Permian and Mid-Continent equivalent production of 547.7 million a day was down slightly, 1%, and this is due to the pipeline and facility shut-ins that I mentioned, the ethane rejection and our planned deferred completion of our Cana infill wells.","All the while, our Gulf Coast production of 42.4 million a day came in a little bit better than we had expected, down just 6.8 million a day or 14% in Q1.","But despite the shut-ins, we continued to demonstrate significant year-over-year production growth in the Permian and the Mid-Continent. As we compare ourselves to Q2 '11, our combined Q2 '12 Permian and Mid-Continent equivalent net production was up 80.7 million a day. That's up 17% from Q2 '11, with the Permian up 65 million a day and Cana up 41 million a day, both of which are 36% increases.  And both are directly related to where the focus of our capital has been over the last year.","Outside of the ethane rejection and larger-than-expected facility shut-ins during the first half of the year, our 2012 production has really been performing quite well, and in essence, hitting our plan. As we mentioned when we first issued our 2012 guidance and we reiterated again last call, the significant portion of our anticipated 2012 production adds were projected to occur in the latter half of this year, And that's driven primarily by our Cana infill well frac schedule. As we mentioned last call, as of March 31, we have 39 gross or 18 net Cana wells waiting on completion. And as Tom mentioned, at June 30, this figure had grown to 57 gross and 24 net wells waiting on completion just in Cana.","Although we initiated our infill frac operations in late May and in essence completed 6 of those gross wells, 2.4 net, by the end of the quarter, our production adds from these wells were really not anticipated to be seen until the Q3 timeframe.","So really, nothing has changed in that regard. The only items that have played a significant role in our year-to-date production as compared to our beginning year guidance really have been just the facility shut-ins and the ethane rejection that we've experienced. The impact of these 2 items were more pronounced in Q2 than Q1. But over the first half of the year, they've averaged about 11 million to 13 million a day that didn't show up on the scoreboard.","So looking forward, our current full year guidance model does incorporate the Q1 and Q2 impact of the shut-ins and ethane rejection. And we also incorporated an estimated 8-million- to 9-million-a-day reduction during Q3 for a projected ethane rejection from Cana during the quarter. With continued anticipated production growth from the Permian and Cana, our modeling continues to support the full year guidance projection we issued last quarter, which was 612 million to 632 million a day, and our Q3 volumes are projected to average 610 million to 640 million a day, a significant jump-up from Q2.","Our projected third quarter combined Permian and Mid-Continent volumes of 575 million to 590 million a day reflect a continued year-over-year increase in production with an estimated 18% to 21% increase from where we were in Q3 '11. And again, that's simply a direct result of our activity in those 2 areas.","With our focus on oil and liquids rich gas, we anticipate that we'll close the year with liquids averaging approximately 48% of our 2012 total company production, and that's up from 44% that we reported in 2011.","And another note I want to point out, as implied by our guidance, we're also projecting a strong exit rate for 2012, which certainly will springboard us into 2013.","Shifting gears to OpEx. With the overall cost increases the industry has seen over the last year, LOE has become an even more important focus for our production group. Our immediate focus has been on reducing SWD costs, primarily in the Permian, and to implement measures to reduce workover costs company-wide.","In conjunction with that, we've put some capital into infrastructure costs that Tom briefly touched on future benefits of those, and our LOE really will never be seen. And that's some of the benefits that we'll get out of putting in our own saltwater disposal facilities, our own trunk lines, our high-pressure and low-pressure gas service for gas lifts, central delivery points, common points of compression, getting out ahead of the infrastructure for power to reduce our power generator costs and so forth and so on.","So a lot of those will show up down the road. We won't see it yet, but overall, when we look at the lifting cost figure from this point forward, we are anticipating to see future improvements.","So as a result, our Q2 lifting costs came in at $1.16 per Mcfe. That's down $0.07 or 5.7% from Q1. With our continued focus on cost controls, like I've measured, and as well as the reduction we saw in Q2, we've slightly revised our full year LOE guidance down to $1.15 to $1.30 per Mcfe simply by just lowering the upper end of the range that we issued last quarter.","Finally, on the service cost side, we've seen the majority of service costs, such as rigs, mud, directional, cementing, bids, et cetera, stay fairly flat over the quarter. And for that matter, over the last few quarters, as far as the rig market is concerned, 1,500 horsepower top drives continue to appear to be in demand, but we see the market showing some signs of softening.","A rig may become available and may be available for a short while, and then it gets picked up, but it's not as tight as we saw the market a quarter ago.","In Cana, we continue to see the benefits of our program drilling efficiencies with the average days to TD for our Cana core wells now running about 40 days as compared to 50 days in 2011 and the 64 days we saw when we first began the program in 2007 and 2008. And that's a real testimony to the improvements we've been able to make where the efficiencies are associated with program drilling.","Despite slightly larger fracs, our current Cana core AFEs are running about $7.5 million. That's down about $100,000 from the number we gave you last quarter and it's at or below the levels that we saw over a year ago.","With our infill efficiencies that we're just starting to see, we're projecting that some of our recent faster drilled Cana infill wells may come in well below $7 million once we've finished our completion work.","So we're seeing tremendous improvements through efficiencies in Cana. As far as the Permian is concerned, although availability for nearly all tools, services and equipment can be a challenge and require a good planning. Really outside of trucking for heavy equipment, we haven't noted any significant changes in cost components. And as such, our Permian well costs remain relatively unchanged from last quarter.","Our 8,000- and 9,000-foot TVD Second Bone Spring New Mexico well with a 4,700-foot lateral are still running around $5.8 million to $6.5 million. That's flat with our Q1 estimates. And as we've talked about before, as TVDs approach 11,000 feet going deeper into the basin, that generic well will run closer to $6.8 million to $7.1 million.","Our generic West Texas Third Bone Spring AFEs are running about $7.5 million to $8 million. That's down $1 million to $1.5 million from where we were at the end of last year and the beginning part of this year due primarily to the program efficiencies we mentioned and also our completion design changes that we've made in that program by going to cemented liners, fewer stages and using white sand in our completions.","In our current Wolfcamp, AFEs continue to come in around $8 million to $8.5 million. That's right on track with the estimates that we provided last call.","So in summary, we had another good quarter. Our Q2 production came in as planned. Our full year guidance remains unchanged and our Q2 LOE reduction is certainly headed in the right direction, with our drilling and completion costs remaining in check. So as we move in to the second half of the year, our teams simply will just keep their focus on maximizing production and improving our LOE and well costs where we can.","So with that, I think now I turn the call back over to the operator for any questions that you all may have.","Thomas E. Jorden","That's right.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Brian Lively.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to start just by clarifying the ethane commentary. I'm not sure if I missed this, but for your Q3 guidance, how much ethane have you backed out for potential curtailment there?","Joseph R. Albi","Brian, this is Joe Albi. The modeling that we're using is approximating about an average of 8 million a day of a reduction for specifically ethane rejection. And the only place we're seeing it is at our Cana processed gas that is tied to a Conway price.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's understandable. On the Permian side, I think you guys have given 600,000-barrel recoveries for the New Mexico Bone Spring and something like 730,000 for the Third Bone Spring. Can you update, based on the new well data, what you're seeing from an EUR standpoint and maybe add some commentary on the Wolfcamp?","Mark Burford","Brian, you're right. We have given those numbers in the investor presentation. Those numbers are reflecting some of the wells in the second quarter, and we are incorporating some of those, Brian. So I don't think our averages will change materially from what we have described in those averages there.","Thomas E. Jorden","Brian, this is Tom. We are you seeing an increase on our EURs in both plays based on, I think, better geological targeting, better stratigraphic targeting and better completions. So our recent wells, depends on the average, I'm looking at a table here, that's in our investor material. But if you look at our average from 2009 to the third quarter 2011, in the Second Bone Spring, we've increased our average 50%. I mean, we're currently at a tight curve that's 600 or better Mboe in the Second Bone Spring. And then, likewise, if you look at a period of time from 2006 to the third quarter of 2011 and you compare that with the third quarter 2011 to current, we've had a 60% increase on our Third Bone Spring EURs. And there's a fair amount of variance in those EURs, as you know. But we're certainly seeing, I would say, 700 to 800 Mboe in the Third Bone Spring play per well.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","That's great. And then I think that you guys had some commentary in the past about possibly targeting some of the oilier Avalon intervals. Can you provide an update on that? I mean, have you all tested any of those wells yet?","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes. We've drilled a few Avalon wells. We brought a few Avalon wells online this year in Southern Lea County, and they're okay wells. I mean, we're not talking about specific wells there. We have a great exposure to the Avalon play, but we currently don't see us competing for capital with some of our other opportunities. We have a fairly tremendous inventory of Avalon opportunities. Again, we know probably less about it than some of the experienced operators, but we have some pretty good exposure. We just don't model it right now competing with capital with some of our other opportunities.","Operator","The next question comes from line of Ryan Todd.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions for you. On the -- as you ramp down to a 4-rig run rate in Cana, which I'm assuming is that 4 rigs and 1 frac crew on your infill pads, what's the right way to think about the run rate on CapEx of that level in Cana?","Thomas E. Jorden","This is Tom. We're -- right now, of course, Cana is not just Cimarex. And so with 4 rigs, there's a pretty good chance that we may have as much or more non-op capital as we do operating capital. Right now, we're carrying as a placeholder for 2013. If we exit with 4 rigs and we stay with 4 rigs, it looks like we'll be at about $350 million for Cana. It could be as low as $250 million, so I'd give you a range of $250 million to $350 million. And the swing there is how much outside operating capital we're exposed to. We certainly like what we're seeing at Cana, so we're staying in everything. And we're not setting in stone that we'll be exiting with 4 rigs. It's just what we're looking at as we look to the remainder of 2012 going into 2013. I think you can expect us to be much closer to cash flow next year than we have been this year. This year, we spread a little to really, quite frankly, overcome that Gulf Coast headwind, which was a decline both in gas and oil production. One of those Gulf Coast wells were pretty oily. So we're in an outspend situation this year to try to catch that, and we've done a nice job. And so next year, we're still putting our plans together. But if we go with that 4-rig program in Cana, the direct answer to your question is we we'd be between $250 million and $350 million bold net exposure, and that swing is on outside operated.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great, I appreciate that clarity. I mean, is it right to think of it, from a completion level, the fact you alluded to completion program that you started in late May will continue at a fairly steady pace for the 12 months following that through...","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, so we will be completing wells through May of 2013 on our current infill program, completing continuously.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just broadly, if we look at the Permian, you obviously have --  I mean, you've spoken and given some good color in terms of downtime that you had in some of the facilities in the Permian in the quarter. More broadly on your infrastructure in the Permian Basin, what are you seeing right now across your areas on infrastructure? Potential bottlenecks or sources of concern over the next 18 months?","Joseph R. Albi","Well, this is Joe. We do have concerns about takeaway issues and it's not so much the immediate capacity or processing availability of that. As much as there's NGL takeaway capacity, we're aware of the certain infrastructure that's contemplated by the industry to remedy that. But that's like 2013 and into '14, and then downstream of that, you've got the petrochem side of it. So we can't control any of that. What we can do is what we have been doing, and that is to put in our own infrastructure, process our own gas if we have to at the same time that we're working with other processors out there to try to firm up capacity where we can. That's kind of a vague answer, but the bottom line is there is short-term capacity that we see. The disruptions that we have seen have not necessarily been due to us not having a market as much as it has been due to the patchwork on the processors and gather site to increase capacity where they can.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Mario Barraza.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Just want to dig a little deeper on the Wolfcamp shale wells on the Delaware Basin. I know you've only drilled a few, but the oil cut looks to be significantly higher. Do you have any idea on what percentage of your acreage here might be perspective for this higher oil cut?","Thomas E. Jorden","Yes, this is Tom. We haven't de-risked enough our acreage to say. I mean, one of the things we do know is, in general, it's getting oilier as we go to the east on our acreage, and yet there are some other factors in the play there. I wouldn't just simply say east is good. East is also a little deeper, maybe a little higher water. So there's a lot of factors in play. I don't have, and I would -- I don't have an answer to your question on how many -- our perspective for high oil cut. But I will say with all the wells we've drilled, our average has been about 55 barrels per million. So we're seeing good oil cuts throughout much of the play. And then there are a lot of things we're experimenting with. This is a section that's 600- to 800-feet thick, so oil cut varies east to west, but it also varies with depth. It varies with stratigraphy, and we're playing around with that. And I will say some of our higher oil cuts are functions of, I think, some real creative success our teams have with addressing those questions. But how it's going to average out to all of our acreage, it would be foolish for me to try to even answer that question, and we're too early to know.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And then on the cost side, I appreciate all the color you guys gave. I guess, where do you think in the Delaware Basin kind of on the Wolfcamp where you -- I know we're early here, where ultimately would you like to get your well costs to?","Thomas E. Jorden","Again, this is Tom. We're very optimistic on the cost side, and our drilling completion group has really been focusing on that lately. Some of the lessons, learnings from Cana where we replicate the same wells over and over. It's all about efficiency, running new ideas, sharing information on any advance. A lot of our learnings in Cana, we're directly applying to the Wolfcamp. We've put that infrastructure in place. We're ready to roll to drill the same type of well over and over. And that when we give our operations group that opportunity, every time they'd have that opportunity, they've shined. And I'm very optimistic. One of the things we have seen over the last quarter is our well costs are holding flat and in the Permian, that's a wonderful thing to say. They had been increasing, creeping up over time. So to answer where do I want them to be, we're currently at, a, in some change on the Wolfcamp. I would certainly look for a 10% or better reduction on that. Joe, you're going to want to be the one to make that happen, what's your answer?","Joseph R. Albi","Well, I certainly agree with what Tom is saying, and I think the best model is Cana by itself. When we started that project in 2007, 2008, when they really kicked it off, we have data that we prepared back then saying, \"Hey, here's this program, 4 years from now, where do we think it can be from just a drill-time standpoint?\" And we had projected that we could get our time to TD down by 60% or 40% to 60% of the days that it was taken. [indiscernible] numbers there that basically did just that. So 4 years later, we were successful in reducing our drilling time by 40%. That alone, on the drilling cost side, gives you an idea, a ballpark of the cost reduction, I guess, that could come out of that, especially when you take our total well costs and you say about half of them are on the completion side. So maybe 40% of the drilling cost side will get you right about to the number Tom's talking about.","Thomas E. Jorden","If you look at it, and we're seeing these improvements now, they're showing up in performance first, and then from that will come costs. Same thing we saw on Cana. In Cana, we saw tremendous improvements with our days drilling, and those improvements lead cost improvements. But if you look at our Wolfcamp drilling from inception to date and you line up our wells, you had a 40% reduction in drilling days. So we're absolutely moving in the right direction. I think, as Joe has talked, this infrastructure we put in, in the Culberson County has been exactly the right move for us. We have a nice consolidated asset and we are well positioned to do what our operations group does well. And then you give them something that's repeatable, concentrated and let it rip. And I really do expect these costs to show great improvement over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Cameron Horwitz.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Can you just remind me how much acreage do you have in Reeves County? And do you guys have any plans to drill any Wolfcamp test here over the next year or so?","Thomas E. Jorden","We do have a fair amount of acreage in Reeves County, I don't know the answer.","Mark Burford","Cameron, this is Mark. I think we talked about Third Bone Spring acreage, which is a lot of it being at Reeves County. It's about 35,000 net acres in the Third Bone Spring position we have there.","Thomas E. Jorden","We also have some acreage aside from that that's in more of the Wolfcamp Fairway, and we're talking about that now. There are some drilling by others out there that we don't have to always do the first tear [ph] on the campaign. So there's a fair amount of activity out there that hopefully we'll be able to leverage. But we have drilled some initial wells, kind of in the Central Reeves County that produced a little more water than we were expecting. And again, this is a fixed section, so there's a lot of variables that you can fix that. And so that's a long winded way to say I don't have any acreage and what we're going to do with it. But we do have a position in Reeves County.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","No, that works.","Thomas E. Jorden","We're focused on Culberson, but I will say that just, parenthetically, we have a lot of opportunity. We talked about moving this organization to cash flow, that's going to be a bit of a shock to a lot of our teams because we have a lot of opportunity. And so one of the things that I'm asking you to one of our operating groups to present is what's your minimum capital, the whole acreage and not let things we like expire. And so they've been sending me that list as we look at the years ahead. And that was the first thing Permian said. And some of this Central Reeves acreage, it may change because we may want to get out there and drill it and save it and then they may look really good to us. So it really is a debated point here that's influx.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Okay. And also staying on the Wolfcamp, is the longest lateral you drilled that 4,500-foot or if you guys tried some longer laterals there yet?","Thomas E. Jorden","We've not tried a 2-section lateral. I think our actual longest lateral is a little longer than that because those are big sections. Those are not 640-acre sections. They're -- I forget how many acres they are. I don't think they're quite 700, but they're larger sections so you can get a little longer lateral. We've not yet drilled a multi-section lateral. We have a couple of them on the books. I think we'll probably get 1 or 2 done this year. And right now, they look expensive, but they also look like they may be exactly what this play needs.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Sure. So there's no reason why you couldn't extend those in terms of looking at -- I guess in the Bone Spring, you got some geologic risk when you extend. But here, you could see this going up to maybe 8,000-foot laterals?","Thomas E. Jorden","We could. It becomes a land challenge at that point. You certainly have to control enough of the adjacent sections to make that worth a headache, but that's absolutely on our shortlist of play development ideas.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just last one for me, jumping on the Bone Spring. I mean, you said in the past, you guys have been pretty aggressive or at least trying to be aggressive in terms of adding to your position. How do you think your inventory trends from here? I mean, can we expect any kind of upgrade to that 200-plus locations that you guys have been put out there over the next year or so?","Thomas E. Jorden","Well, again, this is Tom. Of course, we've had that number for about 5 years running. We continue to recharge. I will say, it's getting extremely competitive land-wise. At the most recent federal sale, we had a block or 2 where we thought -- we really like them and we thought we were putting extremely aggressive bids on, which we were, and we were not the high bidder. People are paying prices for this acreage, and I would consider everything goes well money. If everything goes well, you get exactly the model that you're predicting, which is a fairly aggressive model. You have no operational issues, no cost overruns, no production delays. If everything goes well, you'd get a reasonable return. But that's a very difficult bill to foot for us because we've got enough experience in the business to know you'd better offer a little windage [ph] if you're looking for a return on your investment. Not everything goes well. So we have a lot of ways to acquire acreage in that trend. We have a very aggressive team in Midland that is a great set of dealmakers. They do section-by-section deals. Part of that land is controlled by people that don't have the stomach for a deep horizontal well. They may control the land because of shallow production and they're amenable to a conversation about market. So we're continuing to work it. We're continuing to add opportunity. Will we have a material change in our 200- to 300-well inventory? I can't promise that. All I can say is that we get up every morning and work on it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] There seemed to be no further questions at this time.","Mark Burford","Great. Thank you, Tony, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate the team for joining us, and maybe Tom and I can see you down in Houston at the Tudor, Pickering Conference or Paul might see you in New York at the Tuohy Brothers Conference next week. So again, thank you for participating in the conference call today, and we look forward to continue reporting to you as we run in the future. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
