[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Mark Kroeger, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Mark W. Kroeger","Thank you, Collin, and good morning, all. Thanks for joining us. We'll start the conference call today with comments from Ken Lowe, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Joe NeCastro, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. Our prepared remarks should take about 20 minutes, then we'll open it up for questions. Also on the call this morning is John Lansing, President of the Scripps Networks' Operating Division; and Lori Hickok, Executive Vice President of Finance. ","Let me remind you, if you prefer to listen in via the Internet, go to our website, click on Investor Relations and find the microphone icon on the landing page. Additionally on the page, under the microphone icon, you'll find our fourth quarter earnings presentation materials that we'll be referring to during the prepared remarks portion of our call. An audio archive will be available on the site later today and we'll leave it there for 2 weeks so you can access it at your convenience. ","Our discussion this morning will contain certain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from those predicted, and some of the factors that may cause results to differ are set forth in our publicly filed documents, including our Form 10-K. With that, I'll turn it over to Ken.","Kenneth W. Lowe","All right, Mark, thank you, and good morning, everyone. As always, we appreciate your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. 2011 was a truly outstanding year for the company and we ended up with very strong fourth quarter results due to double-digit increases in revenues, segment profit and earnings growth, which you're going to hear more about on the call a little later. I have to say I was extremely proud of our business leaders across all our brands and various businesses.","Our focus on building world-class brands in the categories of home, food and travel is just one reason for Scripps Networks Interactive's solid performance in 2011. Our strong growth is also a direct result of our expertise in engaging audiences, particularly upscale female viewers that our advertisers value. Fans incorporate our brands into their everyday lives. We influence the foods they eat, the homes they live in and the places they want to travel. Now, this level of engagement is rare for television networks and advertisers know it. That's why our networks are must buys for advertisers and also must carries with our distributors. There's no doubt that Scripps Networks Interactive is a rapidly growing, multi-platform media company and we're doing all we can to perpetuate and sustain the company's success in 2012 and for years to come. ","At the Food Network, we're building on the excellent momentum generated in the fourth quarter, which was its highest-rated quarter ever, solidifying its status as a top 10 network. The success of programs like Next Iron Chef America, Restaurant: Impossible and Rachael vs. Guy contributed to the network's outstanding results. Rachael vs. Guy debuted as the #1 show in the 9 p.m. time slot and #2 on cable for the night overall. In fact, Food Network was the highest-rated, most-watched cable network that evening.","With results like these, it's no surprise that the Daily Meal, which is a popular website about all things food, recently named Brooke Johnson, President of the Food Network, as the most powerful person in all of food. So congratulations to Brooke and the talented team at Food Network for this recognition and for their many achievements this past year. They have truly defined the food genre for television and they're on their way to claiming a unique competitive advantage in publishing and digital worlds as well. ","Food Network Magazine maintained its rank as the #1 culinary magazine on newsstands. It's also the sixth-ranked magazine overall based on newsstand sales. Online, foodnetwork.com generated more than 120 million page views during Thanksgiving week alone. And on Facebook, Food Network can claim more than 2.3 million friends, more than double that at the end of 2010. We're also seeing consumer engagement in the mobile app space. To date, we had more than 450,000 paid downloads of Food Network's In The Kitchen app, making it the #1 paid culinary app in the iTunes Store.","The terrific brand equity extends to our branded products as well. We now have more than 1,000 Food Network licensed products at Kohl's Department Stores. And our branded wine collection, called Entwine, by the way, continued to exceed all expectations, ranking 34th in the premium wine category out of almost 400 labels. ","For 2012, not only do we want to maintain our top 10 network ranking, but we hope to push this power brand even higher to a top 5 status within the next few years. Now, to support this goal, we're investing in more special events, more premieres and more new series. We're also exploring new programming formats and new ways to enhance the viewer experience. And we're also evolving existing successful franchises, like Food Network Star, Extreme Chef and Chopped, and finding new roles for existing talent and increasing convergence across platforms. ","We have an ambitious strategy for success over at HGTV as well. We forged a strong bond at HGTV between the love media consumers have for their homes and the entertaining and informative quality of our programming. Being consistently faithful to that core concept is why nearly 1 million U.S. households tune in to HGTV during prime time every night and really why HGTV is the #1 network for upscale women. HGTV finished 2011 on a very high note, with the highest-rated December ever in total day for adults 25 to 54. HGTV also tied for the highest ever fourth quarter total day rating for the network. Fourth quarter success at HGTV was driven, in particular, by Selling Spelling Manor. For the night, more than 4.2 million people tuned in to watch Candy Spelling, wife of the late TV producer Aaron Spelling, give a tour of the 56,000 square foot Hollywood mansion. The special anchored a night during which HGTV ranked #3 in all of cable for that coveted audience of upscale women. ","Now in 2012, we plan to adjust programming for more vertical stacking of successful shows on individual nights like Holmes on Homes, which worked very well for us in December. And we'll have more new premieres of popular franchises, like House Hunters and other fan favorites, and we'll have more spinoffs of HGTV hit titles. ","Like Food Network, audience engagement with HGTV extends beyond the television. The new HGTV Magazine is already off to an amazing start. In just its second publishing, the magazine has surpassed our expectations and those of our partner, Hearst Publishing (sic) [Hearst Magazines], with newsstand sales of several hundred thousand copies. We have a lot to look forward to as we invest to grow HGTV into a top 10 network during the next few years. ","Now turning to the Travel Channel, we're building momentum as we work to redefine and own the travel genre, just as we've done successfully with the food and home categories. The fourth quarter premiere of The Layover with Anthony Bourdain, along with continued strong performance from Ghost Adventures, helped Travel Channel close out 2011 as its second highest-rated year ever. We built a very solid foundation for the brand in 2011, which has enabled us to start this year with triple the number of returning series and more than double the number of talent on the network.","Plus there are more exciting shows and concepts in the pipeline. We developed a new series featuring the popular Adam Richman to replace Man v. Food, and we're leveraging successful formats from our other networks' franchise shows, with new Travel Channel titles like Vacation Hunters, Vacation Crashers and Hotel Impossible. We've also put our unique spin on popular programming formats with a new series called Baggage Battle that follows 3 very savvy auction specialists who travel the world, snatching up unclaimed and lost personal property in an attempt to turn huge profits. We think the series promises to be great fun and we hope you'll get a chance to check it out. ","Travel Channel does remain our single biggest growth opportunity, and with the combination of successful returning series and new programming planned for 2012, we're very optimistic about developing Travel Channel into a leading multi-platform lifestyle brand like HGTV and Food Network. Of course, our optimism goes beyond our fully distributed networks. Our flanker brands, DIY Network and Cooking Channel, finished 2011 as the highest-rated year in their history. And they're off to great starts in 2012, I might add. At DIY, their record-breaking performance in the fourth quarter was bolstered by top performers like Rescue Renovation, I Hate My Bath and Bath Crashers. At Cooking Channel, Good Eats, hosted by Alton Brown, drove strong rating performance in 2011. And Bitchin' Kitchen, the exciting comedy cooking show, hosted by chef comedienne Nadia G, also pushed ratings and created great media buzz around the Cooking Channel brand. ","For Great American Country, December proved to be a hugely successful month thanks in large part to the National Finals Rodeo, which aired live from December 1 through 10. All 10 telecasts ranked among the top 30 most watched prime time telecasts in GAC history, including top 5 slots. The final episode scored the highest rating in GAC's history and the really great news is, the national finals rodeo will be returning to GAC in 2012. We're enthusiastic about GAC's new direction as we shape its Living Country format and focus. ","And turning to international, the highlight during the fourth quarter was the completion of the UKTV transaction. Now we think this is an outstanding opportunity to be part of a thriving, multichannel, dual revenue stream media business in one of the world's largest television markets. We look forward to a long and mutually beneficial partnership with BBC Worldwide on UKTV. ","Now staying in the U.K., our other investment, Food Network U.K., maintained its enviable status as the country's leading food-themed channel. We've launched some new locally developed programs in the U.K. that have proven to be consistent contributors to the success story, with Andy Bates' Street Feast (sic) [Feasts] and Reza Mahammed's Spice Prince of India leading the way.","Elsewhere around the globe, we're exploring a number of opportunities with Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America and Canada as the areas of highest focus. So in summary, 2011 was a great year for Scripps Networks Interactive. And we look forward to building and expanding on these very positive trends across all our networks in 2012 and continuing to create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Joe for the financial review. Joe?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to touch on some of the fourth quarter and full year highlights and provide some color on what drove our positive results. I'll then touch on guidance briefly and we'll open it up for questions.","Starting with a consolidated view, total revenue was up 10% on solid advertising growth, as well as continued increases in affiliate fee revenues. Segment profit was up a healthy 14%, reflecting our effective control of non-programming expenses, while we invested in what media consumers are seeing on the TV screen and on other digital platforms. For the fourth quarter, income from continuing operations attributable to SNI grew about 15% to $0.84 per share.","For the full year 2011, the highlights are revenue up 10%, total segment profit up 17%, and income from continuing operations attributable to SNI up 21% to $2.86 per share. So all in, a great quarter and a great year. ","Looking at the key revenue drivers for the quarter, we finished with advertising sales growing around 11% versus last year. Affiliate fee revenues were up about 6%, which is where we paced throughout the year. ","Our networks benefited from the strength of the ad marketplace with fourth quarter scatter versus scatter pricing up in the high-single to low-double digits year-over-year and up high teens to low 20s over the broadcast upfront. ","In the first quarter of 2012, scatter versus scatter pricing is running up in the mid-single digits and scatter to 2011 broadcast is up in the mid-teens. The general tone among advertisers continues to be very positive. ","Another positive sign for 2012 was the development of a calendar marketplace. Of course, because we sold a little bit more inventory into the broadcast upfront to take advantage of the strong pricing, we sold a little less in the calendar market. As for advertising categories, our top 5 were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, auto and financial, and they've been pretty consistent all year long. Based on these current trends, we're pretty optimistic about advertising in 2012. ","Turning to the distribution side of our business, as expected, affiliate fee revenue grew about 6% in the fourth quarter. We renewed our remaining Food Network affiliate distribution agreement that expired at the end of 2011. This new agreement then moved that remaining distribution to the rate card that we established in the marketplace back in 2009. So looking ahead, the net impact of this agreement will be reflected in our 2012 results and will be incorporated into our full-year guidance. ","Now let's take a more detailed look at our primary operating segment, Lifestyle Media. Total segment costs were up about 6% during the quarter and the segment profit was up 13% from the prior year period. Program amortization was up about 8%. As many of you have noted, our programming spend, as seen on the cash flow statement, was up about 33% for the full year. While there's a timing effect, eventually this increased cash spend flows through to the income statement in the form of higher amortization expense. We increased the number of new program launches starting in December 2011 and the premieres of these shows triggered the amortization expense. These new shows helped drive the higher programming expense in the third and fourth quarters of 2011. That accelerated level of program amortization will continue through the first half of 2012, reflecting the investment we made in order to maintain and build on our competitive advantage. ","Moving to our international initiatives. Ken mentioned the big highlight, our UKTV investment. It's worth noting that because of the ownership structure, income from the UKTV partnership will be reported in \"equity in earnings of affiliates\" line. For the quarter, that line item was up significantly to $20 million, compared with about $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. As you'd expect, that increase is primarily related to the UKTV partnership. ","Now turning to the balance sheet, we successfully issued $500 million of 5-year bonds at a very attractive interest rate during the fourth quarter. We also repurchased 2.4 million shares of our own stock for roughly $100 million. I'd add that we were out of the market for part of the fourth quarter while we were working on the bond offering. So that said, look for our repurchase rate to increase somewhat in the first quarter. As a reminder, as of the end of the year, we had $500 million remaining under the current authorization. We ended 2011 with $760 million in cash, including $184 million we generated from continuing operating activities in the fourth quarter. ","Now looking at our 2012 guidance, we expect total revenue to increase 8% to 10%. This increase reflects expected advertising revenue growth in the mid- to high-single digits, coupled with affiliate fee revenue growth in the low-double digits. Based on current business assumptions, we expect some unevenness or lumpiness in the quarterly ad revenue growth trends, with the first quarter advertising revenue likely -- the growth rate there likely falling below our yearly average. We expect ad growth rates in the second and third quarters to trend above the average. ","Now looking at expenses, as we work to drive viewership growth across all of our networks, we expect the programming cash spend to increase in the high-single digits. As a result of this spending, coupled with the increases we saw in 2011, we expect programming amortization expense to increase 13% to 15% this year. And due to the timing of our programming rollout, the first quarter 2012 programming expense should be in a similar range to what we realized in the latter half of 2011. Most of the growth will show up in the first half of 2012, with a dramatic deceleration in the second half of the year. ","We think it's important to emphasize here our resolve to grow this business. Investing now in these powerful brands is clearly the right thing to do. It's an effective use of the company's free cash flow and will create value for our shareholders over the longer term by building on our competitive advantage. It's been our successful formula that's resulted in nearly 2 decades of year-over-year growth at this company. ","As for non-programming expenses, we're expecting to be up 10% to 12% for the year. Marketing and promotion costs will likely be higher as we work to grow viewership. These expenditures will be focused during the first 6 months of the year to help promote the new program launches that we're planning for that time frame. The growth in non-programming costs also reflects the investments we're making in new business initiatives, with a focus on leveraging our extensive programming archives and expertise on digital media platforms. We're also exploring other interactive opportunities close in to our lifestyle content categories as we continue to build out that growing -- our growing international business as well. ","Past experience tells us that organic development of new business holds the most promise for outsized returns. We believe this is a good time to be making some measured and deliberate investments to create new revenue streams and to build value over the long term on promising new platforms and in new geographies. Naturally, as we build these new businesses, the investments will flow through the P&L. ","Now looking at some other items, we expect depreciation and amortization of $100 million to $110 million, interest expense of between $45 million and $50 million, and effective tax rate of 30% to 32% and net income attributable to non-controlling interests of $170 million to $180 million, and capital expenditures somewhere between $60 million and $70 million. So operator, that's it for our prepared remarks. We're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of John Janedis with UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of questions here. Maybe first, on the non-programming costs, can you talk a little bit more there, meaning are you moving towards a period where maybe there's a multi-year upward trend there? Or do you think it's stabilized to maybe a trend here, going forward, looking into the out years?","Joseph G. NeCastro","John, this is Joe. I'll start off, but John can talk a little bit about marketing as well. That category includes marketing expenses, employee costs, all others. Next year -- or sorry, the year we're in now includes a pretty significant increase in expenses or spending on some development initiatives in new businesses, both internationally and domestically. I'd say, to put a range that number, you're probably around in the $30 million range of that spending increases related to that. I would not expect that, that would be a multi-year kind of increase. We're not starting on a venture to spend that kind of money every year, but we do have some money in there to launch a couple of new businesses. John, do you want to talk about marketing...","John Lansing","Briefly, we're launching several new series across all of our major brands in the first and second quarters, and we're putting some commensurate marketing investment behind that. On the one hand, to continue to strengthen the position of Food Network, which finished up January as the 8th-ranked network in all of cable. And also, to boost and grow Travel Channel so it can aspire to turn in the kind of results that both HDTV and Food are turning in. So it's really about a boost in the first half of the year and I don't anticipate that being a year-in and year-out run rate.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And maybe one on the Food renewal. Joe, I think the last deal you did, you had the gap up in year 1, if you will, and that stepped down in the, I think, it's in the low to mid singles maybe in year 2, going forward. Is that kind of a similar deal, the one you just did, to the prior ones?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes, that's the same pattern, John.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then one other quickie is, can you give us an update on your appetite towards SVOD deals?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Sure, I can touch on that, John. We are in the process of evaluating a number of those deals right now, including some deals that are in partnership with our affiliate partners. We see the value of our library and we think the window is still open for us to do some significant deals over the next -- this year and beyond.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.","Christopher Merwin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is actually Chris Merwin for Anthony. On 2012 guidance, I think the programming expenses of 13% to 15% sort of jumped off the page for a lot of people. Is it fair to say that the bulk of those increases are related to programming for the Travel Channel as you look to boost ratings ahead of the affiliate fee negotiations? And could you also help give us some color on how programming expenses will trend throughout the year?","John Lansing","I'll jump on that, Chris. It's really 3 buckets, if you will, of the programming investment. You're absolutely correct. Number one priority for us is to invest in Travel, because the payoff for improved ratings in Travel are significant. The second is Food Network and HGTV collectively, extremely strong brands. We just -- we wanted to make sure we were investing enough to maintain the growth pattern in Food and to move HGTV up even closer where Food is towards a top 10 network. And then GAC, we've been really looking forward to a programming solution, if you will, for GAC. And a small amount of our investment is going towards developing the lifestyle country programming genre that Ken mentioned in his opening remarks.","Kenneth W. Lowe","And, Anthony, as far as the pattern throughout the year, I think -- I'm sorry, it's not Anthony, is it? It's Chris. What I mentioned in the remarks was that it will fall off dramatically in the back half of the year. What you're seeing through the first half is sort of the continuation of 4 quarters that started in the back half of 2011 and will continue through mid-2012. And then you'll see a significant deceleration on the growth rate on the back half.","Christopher Merwin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just on capital allocation, I was wondering if you could help us think about your current priorities. I know incremental return on capital might be possible potentially through a higher dividend, international expansion you mentioned earlier. And then I know that the Food buy-in is still on the table. If you could just help us think about the order of priorities, that would be helpful.","John Lansing","Well, you did a pretty good job right there, yourself. I'd say our priorities are growth oriented. So to the extent you could acquire the Food Network stake at a reasonable price, absolutely that's a value creator and I think an immediate value creator. But it's dependent on price. So that is always in the back of our minds. It's hard to call it a priority because we can't manage the timeline on that. We just are continuing to let everyone know that we are an interested buyer and we are sort of anxiously awaiting their emergence from bankruptcy. With respect to the other priorities, you're hearing from John some of our most important priorities, which are to make sure that ratings of the big networks continue to grow, but beyond that, international is a huge priority for us, as you know. We're going to continue to invest there. Although as we've said repeatedly, that's not going to be in bet the farm sized chunks. It will be likely operating losses for a while as we ramp up in certain countries. And there could be smaller strategic acquisitions that make sense for us. So you'll see some of that on the international front. And then the digital front is probably the second most important in terms of things that we think will improve growth. We have a couple of new business ideas, things that we're launching. Unfortunately, we can't go into too much depth on both of those at the moment but you should stay tuned for those. And then with respect to return of capital, we don't think that any of those, any of the above will impinge on our ability to continue to return capital to shareholders. We are -- obviously, we evaluate the dividend every year. Both the dividend and the completion of and potential renewal of share repurchase program will be before the board this year. So we're going to continue to be aggressive in returning capital as well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So a couple of questions. What are the losses this year associated with the new digital business launches?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Well, I don't want to get specific to that extent. I threw out a number of about $30 million that would include those, as well as the international losses we're going to generate this year, in excess of the prior year. So growth in expenses year-on-year is in that area.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And that's part of the non-programming cost guidance, right?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, it is.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The new digital businesses part is, but the international is not.","Kenneth W. Lowe","No, they're both -- that's all in there.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","They're both in there, okay. So that was the total company non-programming cost growth guidance.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Correct. That's correct.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Any color behind the seasonality in the advertising growth rates you sort of mentioned for 1Q and 2Q, 3Q? Why 1Q slower and 2Q, 3Q faster?","Kenneth W. Lowe","The seasonality on the growth rates for ad sales, there's really not a great deal of change as I look at this fourth quarter. Is Lori going to...","Lori A. Hickok","Yes, that's usually typical. Our second and fourth quarters are typically stronger, so you would expect your first quarter not to be not quite as strong as your second. So as you ramp in, so that's really just a typical seasonality pattern that you're seeing there.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You're talking about growth rates though, right? Not absolute dollars?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Well, actually in absolute dollars. The second and the fourth are usually the largest for us.","Lori A. Hickok","Which again, your growth rates, too, can kind of follow that pattern, too.","Kenneth W. Lowe","I think what we're calling out is that the first quarter is a little bit -- we just didn't want to make people aware -- we wanted to make people aware that the second quarter is bigger than the first. And to -- so just as you're thinking about your modeling for the quarters, just to sort of get the pattern right.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then sort of 2 esoteric ones. For equity and earnings for affiliates, is the $20 million for the fourth quarter a good run rate to start for 2012, now that your U.K. deal is in there? $20 million would be $80 million for 2012. Does that start to get in the ballpark for JV income?","Lori A. Hickok","I think you need to be a little careful because with JVs, they can be a little lumpy. But I think you would need to look at the impact because the UKTV will be impacting our year-over-year, and there's really not much new other than what you would expect normal growth out of those ventures. So that's really the new piece in there, so...","Kenneth W. Lowe","Right. That is how to think about it. The UKTV will be in there for a full year. It was only in for...","Lori A. Hickok","A quarter, yes.","Kenneth W. Lowe","A quarter this year.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. So I could -- so annualizing the fourth quarter, okay. So...","Lori A. Hickok","That means that's a good basis to use...","Kenneth W. Lowe","The increase was UKTV. So you're not going to annualize all $20 million, I assume.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Not as an increase, but if $20 million as a number for the quarter times 4 would be $80 million, that was the thought. And then the last esoteric one. It seems like the dividends you're paying out to minorities is less than what you're expensing on the income statement. Is that similar in 2012, when we think about the guidance towards $170 million to $180 million of minority interest? What should we think about it on the cash side for that?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Doug, over time those should track exactly. There is some lumpiness because of the way the timing and the distributions on some of these matters you have, especially with respect to Travel. There hasn't been much of a distribution pattern yet at Travel because of some tax issues. So that will be a little bit lumpy. We'll try to give you a little more guidance on that when we get to a point where we're starting to do the distribution side of the Travel partnership.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. So it's fair to say that given the tax issues, it might be less than the expense again this year?","Kenneth W. Lowe","That's there.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","If I could just circle back I think on your answer to the last question, I want to make sure I understand it correctly. The relative weakness in, I guess -- or I guess it's not really weakness, but the ad growth not being as strong in Q1 as the rest of the year. It looks like your comps are actually going to be even a bit easier in Q1 than Q2. Is there something else I'm missing just between -- besides seasonality in terms of looking at year-over-year growth? I mean, is there a pullback? I think we heard from one of your competitors that the CPG segment has maybe pulled back a little bit in the first quarter. I guess, any more color you can give us on the ad market in Q1.","John Lansing","Sure, Alexia, I'll be happy to do that. This is John. I actually spoke to our ad-sales guys this morning in anticipation of the call and they tell me that the market remains strong. With scatter over scatter pricing, as Joe mentioned earlier, is in the high singles, low doubles and the scatter over upfront mid-teens. There's still demand in the marketplace. There's unusually good demand in the digital marketplace, particularly for online video, that we're seeing. And so there's -- our ratings are strong. Our pricing is good. The marketplace is there. We just anticipate that when we get to the second quarter, there may be 1 or 2 more points of growth just based on the improving economy. As we see the economy improving, particularly the housing economy, we think we'll benefit from that particularly in the second quarter and then moving on through the rest of the year.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and then still following up on that topic, I mean, you guys have done such an impressive job on the Food Network rating. Is there, I guess, sort of a similar amount of scatter inventory available maybe in the March quarter that you can monetize that great run you've had? And then if you can also just touch on the cancellations. Have you seen how those trending for the June quarter?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Sure. The answer to the first part of your question is yes, we have plenty of scatter available to take advantage of the ratings and the demand. And in terms of cancellations, we're really at about a normal rate, 2% to 3% on the upfront from last summer. The normal rate for the calendar upfront is a little bit closer to 4% to 5% and we're right at about the 5% range for that, nothing unusual there. And so we're continuing to be optimistic about the ad market and seeing demand, particularly good demand in our categories and among our endemic advertisers. We're seeing some -- a great deal of optimism just based on the slowly improving housing economy.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess 2 questions. One to follow-up to the last one. Are you seeing signs through your ad sales and your partners on the housing side that we've already started to see a pickup? I know some of the sort of macroeconomic statistics have seemed to have maybe bottomed, but it sounds like you guys have seen some actual turn in that area, which I know has been a headwind for you for a couple of years now, and certainly would be a big positive looking forward. And then my second question, maybe for Ken, you talked a lot about the digital opportunity for your programming, specifically lifestyle networks and how they fit into tablets and on-demand usage. Now that you've got Comcast on and I think you've done really all your deals on the big networks now behind you, it would seem like you have a better sense for what sort of those folks, your traditional distributors, want from you on the TV Everywhere front and also maybe what you might be able to do on your own. And I'm wondering how you think about those 2 options. Not that they're necessarily mutually exclusive, but do you think one path is better than the other? Or could you see Scripps taking a more direct-to-consumer approach than maybe other media companies have done so far on the digital front, either a streaming service on your own, outside of an authentication; or something using more video on an ad-supported base? Any comments there, I think, would be really insightful.","Kenneth W. Lowe","The answer, Ben, is yes. Look, I think, and I'll let John follow-up on the ad sales question. We're in a very enviable position, going forward, because, as you've heard us talk about both in our comments and our questions, we see this as a real opportunity for investment in the future of the content that we produce. And first and foremost, our distribution partners are providing us with ample opportunity and -- to look at not only the TV Everywhere model but additional models on multi-platforms. And just the opportunities that have developed over the past few months with some of the deals that have been signed, which really underscore the value of TV Everywhere, we think, long term, really bodes well for the kind of content we have. So we're going to be making investments. We'll be making investments with our partners and we'll continue to do what we've always done and that's take a very aggressive digital strategy. I think you heard me mention the number of page views that we had over Thanksgiving with the Food Network. And back to why second and fourth quarter, well, they're just our bellwether because if not only the Home Improvement category as spring opens up and people start working on their homes, but the entertainment and food aspects of the fourth quarter really bode well for us. And that's pretty much been the pattern since we created and launched these networks back in the '90s. So without getting into too many specifics, and you'll hear more as we go along about some of this money we're investing, we're extremely excited about the future and we see it more opportunistic than we do as challenging. It's just a great place for us to be in the 3 categories we're in: the home, food and travel categories. So as Joe said earlier, stay tuned.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ken, is there -- I didn't see anything, maybe I just missed it, but was there a reason there was not sort of broad TV Everywhere piece to the Comcast renewal? I think it was all fairly quiet, which is always good news anyway, but Comcast is obviously very focused on that, as you can see with their Disney extension. It was just a little surprising to see more from your renewal about expanding rights to different devices and windows. Should we read anything into that? Or is it just...","Kenneth W. Lowe","Let me let John take that because he was front and center with Henry Ahn on the negotiations.","John Lansing","Yes, sure. Listen, we're still fine-tuning some aspects of the deal, including TV Everywhere and other opportunities for us to work jointly to create a digital future, both for our business and the current distribution business. So I'd say, without getting into too much detail as we're discussing it, that it's fair to say that our company is interested in working with our incumbent distributors to build a digital TV Everywhere strategy, and we just want to do so in a manner that is mutually beneficial, and those are the details we're working on today.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Morris with Davenport.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","My questions are on the programming cost side, not just for the coming year, which you gave us some really good insight to, but for the longer term as well. And I guess the questions are, first, when I look at the level of cash programming spend that you had in 2011, how close is that getting you to the number of hours that you ultimately want on your networks? I know that moving from let's say like 400 to maybe like the 700- to 800-hour level's important for Travel. So that level, that 500-plus, how close are we there? And then, when we think about how that spending may increase going forward, what's the importance of the ratings success? And how should we be thinking about, if there is incremental cost coming on, when that will be coming on over the next couple of years?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Let me start and then -- Mike, this is Joe. I'll start and then turn it over to John for the sort of longer-term view of that. We are below the normal level, I'd say, in terms of introducing new hours at Travel Channel relative to the others. And that's a combination of things. One is, since you're introducing a lot of new things, you sort of have to keep other things constant to know the effect of the new stuff you're putting on, otherwise you're not really sure what's moving the needle there. And secondly, the real ramp-up comes later down the road when you actually are -- you have successful series and you have that high-class problem of so many people watching that you have to introduce new hours to make sure that it's always fresh. So we would be delighted if we were able to introduce that many new hours on the Travel Channel. It will mean -- at that point, it will mean we have been successful in sort of cracking the code in terms of series that have a longer life and a following that's large enough to notice that we're -- that the repeat factor is too high. So lots to come on that and lots of work. There's some good early signs, some traction we're finally getting that we feel good about. From a longer-term pattern, we'll talk to -- we'll turn it over to John and he can talk to you about the importance of ratings.","John Lansing","Yes, thanks, Joe. So when you think about when we acquired Travel Channel, it was really reliant on 1 or 2 series. In fact, Man v. Food, one series alone, represented 42% of all of the prime time impressions when we acquired it. And as we thought about building this business, we thought about what we did with Travel -- pardon me, with Food and HGTV, and that is to build a brand, a sturdy brand platform, if you will, for programming to be nurtured and grow and find hits within that context. I'm really optimistic about the slate that the team in Travel is putting together right now. We have a really strong group of programmers there under Laureen Ong that have, I think, found a suitable set of series and specials that I think will manifest the Travel brand in a way that will really resonate with the kind of brand Food and HGTV has become on cable television and in digital. And so you're asking the timeline for that, and so that will first begin to unfold in the second and third quarter, into the fourth quarter of this year and then, when we hit our full stride, by the beginning of 2013, we'll be in that position that Joe is describing to really look at the results of '12 and then make some, hopefully, good decisions on what to double down on and move on from there. So call it an 18-month to 2-year process, going forward, and I'm very optimistic from where we are today looking ahead to do that.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","That's great. That's helpful. One other quick thing, then. When we look at the amortization of the programming costs in the coming year, is there any implicit assumption of, perhaps, some higher programming cost write-offs just due to the fact that you have more new programs? Or is it -- does it just imply sort of that normal level that you've seen in the past? I think you've spoken to about maybe a $5 million a quarter level?","Lori A. Hickok","We don't really expect it to increase. In fact, I'd say it'd moderate downward but it does -- there is a level of assumption there that there will be, as there always is, some shows that you need to write off, so...","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Bank of RBC Capital.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. The first one on the guidance in terms of revenue growth. What kind of -- if you look at what you're expecting in terms of ratings versus pricing and even nontraditional monetization, right -- so you've got pricing on your traditional inventory sales and then you guys are sort of better than almost anyone at integrated marketing and sort of in-programming dollars. How do you kind of think about what the drivers are between those 3 categories in terms of your growth guidance on the ad side, is the first question, for next year. And the second question is, I'm a little bit confused about your commentary around the digital strategy and kind of expense growth there. It sounds like you're kind of saying you're maybe pursuing your own kind of OTT strategy here and I want to make sure I'm understanding that correctly. Is it a subscription strategy? Does it preclude you from doing deals with third-party providers ultimately? Is it kind of an either\/or, if I'm understanding correctly? And lastly, it sounds like we have expenses built in for it. Do we have any revenues associated with this business or these initiatives in 2012? And when are we likely to see incremental revenues?","Kenneth W. Lowe","That's a long path. I'll start off. John and I will tag team some of this stuff. With respect to revenue growth guidance, it's sort of an all of the above answer. Ratings are supreme, right? That's the most important thing you can do in any discussion, in that it enables strong pricing and then it certainly enables these nontraditional deals. So first and foremost, the most important assumption in putting together your revenue model for the following year is ratings. And then secondly, pricing. But a lot of the pricing frankly is baked-in with the upfronts and the nature of the beast, and then we just sort of follow scatter. To the extent you can monetize short-term ratings growth in the scatter market, so much the better. But the revenue growth next year is a combination of all the above. And it's hard for me to parse out exactly right now which is which, which level of growth comes from which of those. With respect to...","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Would your current run rate of ratings support this guidance?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes. With respect to the over-the-top questions, John and I both need to weigh in a little bit here. There's a very modest amount of revenue in some of these launches and, I'd say, to answer the end question there, we're not talking about things that are mutually exclusive. Our first priority is to work with our traditional distributors in a way that preserves the model of TV Everywhere. We're big believers. We're big supporters but beyond that, there are things, there are opportunities, we think, to do things on our own as well. And they can be complementary.","John Lansing","Yes. And this is John. We're currently doing that. That's part of our digital business today. We have upwards of $100 million today in digital advertising. The hottest corner of that, if you will, is the video that we serve off of our websites. But as we look to supercharge our digital businesses, we really believe we can do it in 3 dimensions by continuing to do what we do ourselves, to work with third-party distributors, but most importantly, to build a TV Everywhere strategy and take advantage of what we already have in terms of the ecosystem within the affiliate relationships and revenue that flows through there, which is -- which dwarfs the revenue that would come from a third-party deal.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just have a high-level question. Maybe it's a little bit unfair because it talks about the industry, but most of the earnings beats for a lot of your competitors in the space have come from these SVOD sort of onetime payments. And I think while you guys all look at sort of the target demo where -- for the viewer you're trying to attract, if you just step back and you sort of look at the composite ratings for cable networks, all of them, across all demos, the trends have seemed to have gotten demonstrably worse over the last 8 or 9 months, sort of up low-single digits to sort of down mid-single digit. And I guess my question is, do you sense that we're -- that there's -- that the industry would sort of -- or you would agree with that, that there is some cannibalization going on? And is that just sort of a piece of calculus mathematics that you do that says, \"Well, we're willing to take some hits for the non-demo and the non-prime time area because of the dollars we get from some of these other initiatives are greater\"? Or would you disagree and say, \"There really is no cannibalization. All of this viewing that's going on, on these SVOD deals is really incremental\"?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Jason, let me just take a first stab at it. John might want to jump in as well. I do not want to speak for the industry. I can just relate to where we are. There's been a lot of lumpiness in the ratings but the last few months have been very unusual. The NBA strike has impacted quite a few cable networks for a lot of different reasons. There were some timing issues on some other sporting events and there's also, I think, been a very aggressive retooling on some of the broadcast networks. But we're also seeing some significant rating losses there. If you look at Idol and where it's trending down, a lot of the -- American Idol, a lot of those shows. So I think there's a lot of fluctuation going on. The bottom line though, when you look at it on a quarterly and ongoing basis, is cable networks have continued to eat into the ratings overall of broadcast networks. And I think we're going to continue to see growth in the cable network industry. Some of the hottest shows right now, up and down the dial, are on the cable side. So if you take the lumpiness's side of the past few months, I don't think it's anything more than just the up-and-down nature of ratings and some of the fluctuations. Fragmentation is never going to stop. It never has; it never will. And it'll be -- the best shows will continue to win. I mean if you look at some of the results we've had and we talked about this morning in the Food Network, with Rachael vs. Guy and best fourth quarter we've ever had in the history of the network, I mean you have to factor that into that kind of question. So whilst I think some cable networks have taken some hits, and we do that from time to time, overall the future's very bright. Cable network business is very strong and will continue to be so. John, is there anything you want to add to that?","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Mathanson (sic) [Nathanson] with Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","A couple on advertising trends. So can you just dig in to a bit about the calendar upfront versus the broadcaster front? Can you give us a sense of what the -- how the pricing turned out calendar-wise in the upfront versus the broadcast? Or was it similar types of inflation year versus year?","Kenneth W. Lowe","The calendar upfront was in high singles for the most part, with some churn in there that may have had some individual deals a little higher than that. But generally, mid-to-high singles on calendar.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay and then, the question that people seem to dancing around is volumes. So what were volumes like? And we heard volume -- comments about volumes in the fourth quarter. What are volumes like for you in the calendar upfront? And how are volumes looking in the current first quarter?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Sure. The volumes for us are weighted -- the growth is weighted towards our upfront from last summer, slightly -- a slight increase -- or no, a decent increase in volumes from that upfront deal. And that's taken direct response down as a result. Scatter volumes in the mid-to-high singles, upfront volumes in the mid-teens to high teens.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","But the volume is -- I mean, do you see a drop-off in volume at all in the fourth quarter on -- in scatter markets versus last year's scatter markets?","Kenneth W. Lowe","No, we do not see a drop-off in volume in scatter in the fourth quarter.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, and then last one would be, as I look at our models, and I think you guys are saying that second quarter is historically a faster growing quarter. It may be a larger dollar quarter but I don't think second quarter has historically been faster growing. So we're assuming, I guess, in the acceleration, more scatter volume and better scatter pricing, I would think, to get acceleration from 1Q to 2Q. Is that a fair assumption?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes. No, that's a fair assumption and the acceleration is a couple of points, so I don't want to overstate that. But I think the factor that drives the growth rate versus the actual dollars is the improving economy around some of our endemics, particularly on the home side.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just trying to dig into Travel Channel a little bit and some of the issues there. How much of the ratings decline is a function of Man v. Food versus -- you had a lot of new programming launched in the back half of the year. What type of reception did you get from some of those programs? And then secondly, just a housekeeping question. Your program and program license expense in the fourth quarter, how much was that up year-over-year versus fourth quarter of '10?","Kenneth W. Lowe","On the second part of your question, are you asking just about Travel?","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","No, no, no. Overall, for the company, for program licenses.","Kenneth W. Lowe","I'll let Lori look that up and I'll address your first question. The answer is, as I said earlier, the reliance that Travel Channel's prime time delivery had on Man v. Food at its peak was significant. In fact, it was over 40% of all of the prime time impressions at its peak, and then it fell off. Even after it fell off, it was still in the high 20% range. So you combine that with the success of Anthony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern and then the Ghost Adventures, and we really had a network that was fairly reliant on a small number of hit series. We spent the year last year trying to strengthen those series. Unfortunately, Man v. Food as a format just was not sustainable beyond the 3-year arc. But we still are working with Adam Richman to develop new formats that you'll see coming out this year. So we're excited about that. But mostly, what we're doing today is building out some new formats -- some of those were mentioned in the prepared remarks earlier -- that help us create the brand, if you will, around Travel that both strengthened these existing series, these incumbent series, if you will, and build 2 or 3, perhaps 4 new series so that we can be sitting here at the third, fourth quarter and looking ahead and have as many as 6 to 8 series driving the brand versus 2 to 3 that are driving it today.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","So the new programs that have launched thus far in the back half of 2011, how did that perform on a relative basis to some of the other programming launches from prior years, or historically what you've seen across some of your other networks?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, so Tony Bourdain's new series, The Layover, was a breakout success for us and we're renewing that going into 2012. Bizarre Foods took a turn away from international towards American locations, and that's done very well. The Ghost Adventures guys, there was a counter series to that also did well. And then, so we've had some successes now. On the other hand, we had some -- we took some shots at some other series that did not do so well, unfortunately, and that's just the way it works when you're trying to build up, as Joe mentioned earlier, the first year, the first 1.5 years, first 2 years. You're going to try some things in order to center in and find the voice of the network, if you will, and we're beginning to find that voice now based on the successes that we've had coming out of 2011, but we learned from the ones that did not work as well.","Lori A. Hickok","This is Lori. Can you clarify your question on -- with programming cost licenses...","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","In your income statement, when you look at -- when you break out your costs within the Lifestyle Media segment, your program and program licenses costs versus -- in the fourth quarter versus last year's fourth quarter.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Why don't you let us dig that out and we'll come back on when we get the numbers? All right.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tuna Amobi with Standard & Poor's Equity Group.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","So I've got a couple as well. Perhaps, first wanted to get an update on the international launches of Food Network. I know you talked about Europe, South Africa and Asia. Any updates on those? And perhaps other international markets you might be considering as well. That would be helpful.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Now look, we continue to roll out the network, and we had a launch in Ireland and one or 2 other countries in Western Europe in the past year. We continue to do well in the U.K. and especially in South Africa, believe it or not, on ratings. But that continues. These tend to be smaller launches. We're just sort of building out the footprint. So there's not a lot of news on any of them outside of the U.K. where we continue to enjoy great ratings strength, and it's a large ad market and we're doing very well there. But we do continue to launch the network, especially throughout Europe and the Middle East and Africa.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","Okay. On the UKTV, do you see any path, perhaps, to kind of pulling in the digital rights, which is something you've alluded to in the past, that you would be interested in? Is there any kind of game plan there? Or is it just kind of wait and see? And are those discussions ongoing perhaps or not?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, they are ongoing discussions. We continue to be very interested in pulling the digital rights into the UKTV. We think there's a great upside opportunity there. We're just working with our partners to try and size that.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","Okay, and lastly, how do you feel about potentially -- I know you're doing your buybacks, right? So -- and you've talked about all of your priorities, international expansion, whatnot. But in terms of potentially initiating relatively modest dividends, just perhaps consistent with some of your peers -- as you've I'm sure noticed, a lot of the media companies moving in that direction. So would you -- was this something perhaps the board would be interested or perhaps reticent to consider?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Tuna, this is Joe. You used the word initiate. We've been paying dividends since we spun out. We did and we had sort of a material increase in that dividend last year. It's something the board will continue to look at, depending on cash flow generation of the business and other alternatives. So right now, we're paying a combination of a dividend and we're in the market buying shares back as well. So you can look for us to continue the dividend certainly and look for -- we continue to monitor whether or not it makes sense to increase the dividend as we...","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","I actually meant increase. I perhaps used the wrong word. I meant increase. Time Warner increasing theirs and a few others also on that path. So is this something on the radar? You're saying it's a possibility, it sounds like, right?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Certainly something under active consideration.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Eagan with Collins Stewart.","Thomas W. Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division","I've a follow-up on a couple of questions. On digital rights, is there an opportunity to add digital rights from your pay TV operators outside of your typical renewals, like for example, outside of the Comcast renewal, outside of the -- any renewals that you have with Travel in '13? And then I have a follow-up.","Kenneth W. Lowe","In short, the answer is yes. We're interested in having those conversations and we're doing those or having those outside of the typical renewal discussions that would happen anyway. Yes.","Thomas W. Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then separately, following up on Ken's comments on the cable of -- on the programming and the viewers on cable versus broadcast, is there anything to the thesis that Scripps' channels may not be impacted as much by the competition of viewers to broadcast because the programming is just so different?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Well, look, in a general sense, entertainment-based programming tends to have more fluctuations than our type of programming, which is both informative and entertaining. And because of the targeting nature, upscale women, of what our networks do, there tends to be more stability. But having said that, at the end of the day, if the Super Bowl is on, ratings are going to suffer on everybody else besides NBC in the past weekend. So generally, I think we've had more stability over the years than probably the general entertainment broadcast networks and some of the cable networks. But it's still all ratings driven and we're all about how well we do. And as we documented earlier on this call, to have a network that's almost 18 years old, like the Food Network, have its best quarter ever and have Home & Garden put some big-time numbers on the scoreboard for some of the shows we had in the fourth quarter, I think this bodes well for the continuing interest in our categories that consumers have. And as I mentioned in my remarks, there's this passion that are attached to these brands. So many times, we're people's second punch, if you will. They may go up and down the dial and then come back and rest on Food Channel or HGTV because it's just good, consistent, solid programming that has family values and is watched many times by the entire family. So a long-winded way of saying yes, but at the end of the day, it's still all about ratings.","Thomas W. Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division","Right, and then just lastly, in 2011, in terms of the program payments, they exceeded the program amortization, which kind of reversed the trend we saw in 2010. But following up on Joe's comments about how it remains a higher program amort in the first half of '12, for the full year of '12, should we still see program payments exceeded?","Joseph G. NeCastro","I'm sorry, are you saying -- are you asking whether payments will exceed amortization?","Thomas W. Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes, the answer is yes.","Operator","And our final question for this morning will be from the line of David Joyce with Miller Tabak + Co.","David Carl Joyce - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","If you could just provide some updates on what your path to profitability might be for your international plans. I know you did say that there'd be an increase of $30 million in the operating losses this year. I was just wondering what the mix of using programming that's already in the can or maybe can be easily modified versus new programming might be. And then finally, on the distribution of the smaller networks, at what point do you think you'll be as distributed as you think makes sense for those?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Let me take the international question and John can talk about the smaller networks. David, on international, there are -- it's sort of a mixed bag. The venture with UKTV is immediately profitable because we bought an interest in a profitable network, and that's less of an issue. We will be, we hope, working with them on the programming side on their lifestyle networks. But on a pure launch, I guess, probably the best example and certainly the most sizable was the U.K. launch of the Food Network. And it is a mix of programming there. Mostly it's U.S. and some originations from British-based chefs. So you have those 2 elements, and we launched with those 2 and only those 2. And Ken mentioned a couple of commissions we finally did this year when we thought we had enough momentum and enough eyeballs to justify spending a little money on commissions. We do continue to lose money there as we build the business, but we think the right thing to do is to continue to invest so that we build viewership and build an ad-based business there. We think we're on the path to profitability but we're not there yet. I think in other markets, you'll see us with a similar strategy. Some of the good news is that most of -- a lot of the fastest-growing markets in the world are also the cheapest places to produce programming. So we're not concerned about our ability to find programming because we can create it. One thing we do have is extensive experience with formats that we can export, regardless of the language. We might be able to actually produce them much more cheaply and they'll just be just as effective. So we're very optimistic about our ability to be profitable even in a greenfield launch. John, do you want to talk about the smaller numbers?","John Lansing","Just briefly, the -- it's interesting that you bring up the distribution for the smaller networks. All 3 of them had some growth, in fact, sizable growth in subs over the last month. DIY added 5%, GAC 4% and Cooking added 1%. So we're still seeing growth. So we're now upwards of over 62 million for GAC, almost to 60 million for Cooking and DIY. And as that continues to grow, it proves, again to Ken's point earlier, that the platform -- the digital cable platform is sturdy and growing and we have great positions and great brands on those platforms.","Mark W.

Welcome to the Scripps Networks Interactive Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Executive Vice President, Chief Communications Officer, Mark Kroeger. Please go ahead.","Mark W. Kroeger","Thank you, Moses, and good morning, all, and thanks for joining us. We'll start the conference call today with comments from Ken Lowe, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Joe NeCastro, Chief Financial Officer and Administrative Officer. Our prepared remarks should take about 20 minutes, then we'll open it up for questions. Also on the call this morning and joining us for the first time is Burton Jablin, President of the Scripps Networks Operating Division; and Lori Hickok, Executive Vice President of Finance.","Let me remind you, if you prefer to listen in via the internet, go to our website, click on the Investor button and find the microphone icon on the landing page. Additionally, on the page under the microphone icon, you'll find our third quarter earnings presentation materials that we'll be referencing during the prepared remarks portion of our call.

[Operator Instructions]","Let me remind you that our discussion this morning will contain certain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from those predicted, and some of the factors that may cause results to differ are set forth in our publicly filed documents, including our Form 10-K.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Ken.","Kenneth W. Lowe","All right. Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As always, we appreciate your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive.","Now before I get into quarterly results, I'd like to introduce Burton Jablin as President of Scripps Networks, first time joining us on the call. Burton has been the guiding force behind the success of our home category networks, and I look to him to bring the same creativity, motivation and leadership to his expanded role.","We're coming off a very good quarter driven by our ability to attract and engage upscale audience, with our unique lifestyle content. And that's a critical focus for us, because American consumers spent $3.9 trillion on home, food and travel every year. And Scripps Networks Interactive is helping to shape the attitudes that drive those purchases.","Our brands engage more than 170 million consumers every month across our lifestyle television networks, industry-leading websites and mobile apps. Lifestyle content inspires in viewers the same passion and loyalty as, say, sports programming does, and along with the same expectation for immediacy. Our networks comprise the #1 cable group for live viewing. According to Nielsen, 94% of our viewing is live, and that's a staggering number. And it's important to advertisers because our viewers pay attention, they watch the commercials and then they act on what they see. They represent the highest discretionary spending in all of cable. And for the 8th year in a row, I'm delighted to say that HGTV was the #1 cable network for upscale women.","At Scripps, we learn a great deal about buyer behavior and interests from millions who connect with us on social media. But actually, we go way beyond that with our own online focus group called Under One Roof, which aggregates 15,000 consumers recruited specifically for their attitudes and behaviors within our lifestyle categories. So as a result, we can tell packaged-good companies what appeals to food enthusiasts; we can gauge the effect of Travel Channel shows on actual travelers to see which destinations spark the most interest; or we can tell home-related companies what paint colors people are most curious about, and on and on and on.","Our television networks and interactive content businesses are must-buys for advertisers and must-carries for content distributors. For example, a June beta-research study found that, out more than 200 cable channels, Food Network was one of viewers' top 5 favorites. And in that same study, 20% of adults also said they would switch pay-TV providers if their provider dropped the Food Network. Now that is loyalty. Those distinctly unique attributes are what set Scripps Networks apart from its peers.","Now let me briefly talk to you about some network-specific trends, and then I'm going to turn it over to Joe to discuss financials. In home category, we have continued to see the strong viewership trends that we've experienced all year. Shows like Property Brothers and Love It Or List It on HGTV, both hit series ratings highs during the quarter and some new programs are extending the success of our programming pipeline. At DIY Network, Holmes Makes it Right was the highest-rated telecast ever from the network. And based on the popularity of established and new programming, we believe HGTV and DIY Network are poised for further growth.","Food Network has grown into a cultural icon and a highly recognized brand. Now some of you may have seen us ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange a couple of weeks ago in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Food Network. Food Network finished the quarter as the 12th ranked network in cable, led by several notable new program successes like Alton Brown's Cutthroat Kitchen, Rachael vs. Guy: Kids Cook-Off and the returning Great Food Truck Race.","And we have a number of popular seasonal specials coming up too, along with 6 new prime time launches. One of those, Guy Fieri's Grocery Games has already premiered to very strong numbers. Meanwhile, the Cooking Channel new programs like Donut Showdown and Restaurant Takeover gross some very strong audience growth. We expect those positive trends to continue with 6 new premieres in the fourth quarter versus only 4 last year.","Now both Food Network and Cooking Channel continue to help shape America's conversation about food every day. Over at Travel Channel, we're seeing our programming resonate with viewers. Even though Travel Channel skews slightly more male than our other networks, we've experienced minimal impact from the start of the football season. We finished the quarter on a strong note, with new season premieres of viewer favorites like Hotel Impossible and Bizarre Foods America. And in the weeks ahead, we'll bring on 7 new series and 8 new specials in prime time to further drive audience growth.","At Great American Country, our country lifestyle format is really gaining traction. Successful shows like Farm Kings and Celebrity Motor Homes are drawing new viewers to the network. Great American Country is evolving through a celebration of the best America has to offer, so stay tuned to that network.","Turning to international. Our programming is seen in more than 200 countries around the globe. We've seen significantly increased viewership for Travel Channel in the U.K. And we've also expanded the network's reach with our prime time Freeview launch, adding 23 million new subs. Food Network is growing in Eastern Europe and in South Africa. And as you know, we successfully completed the Asian Food Network (sic) [Channel] acquisition during the second quarter with the integration with the existing business virtually complete. Now the team is moving quickly to expand AFC throughout Asia and exploring a number of opportunities in Eastern Europe and Latin America with Food Network and Travel Channel to further enhance our footprint.","So there you have it. Scripps Networks Interactive continues to grow, led by the global popularity of all of our lifestyle networks and driven by pure leading operating results. We're committed to creating value for our shareholders over the long term, a commitment that's borne out in the company's successful track record.","So with all of that with, let me now turn it over to Joe to discuss the financial results. Joe?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to touch on some of the third quarter highlights and provide some color on what drove our positive results, then we'll open it up for your questions.","Starting with the consolidated view, total revenue was up 9% on both advertising and affiliate fee revenue growth. Total segment profit was up 4.4%, which reflects revenue growth, partially offset by the expected higher programming expenses, along with international and digital investments. Net income attributable to SNI was $0.87 per share, up 12% compared with last year.","Now looking at the key revenue drivers, advertising was up 8.7% and affiliate fees were up 9% versus last year. Advertising revenue growth was driven by the strength of the scatter market. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing across the networks was up in the mid- to high-single digits year-over-year and up in the midteens to high teens over the broadcast upfront, which was very consistent with the second quarter.","As for advertising categories, our top 5 were food, retail, auto, financial and consumer packaged goods. So far in the fourth quarter, the scatter advertising market continues to be healthy. Year-over-year, scatter-versus-scatter price growth is running in the mid-single digits and in the midteens over the 2013 broadcast upfront.","Affiliate revenue grew 9% in the third quarter, driven by a number of factors, including annual escalators in our affiliate agreements, a reduction in launch fee amortization, the Amazon online distribution agreement that we announced at the beginning of the year, and our Asian Food Channel acquisition.","Looking at our network performance just in the U.S., revenues were up 7.8% on the strong advertising and affiliate fee growth. Our on-air television advertising revenues were up 9.2%, driven by the strong pricing increases I previously mentioned. Now, however, this growth was partially offset by a decrease in digital advertising. Total lifestyle segment advertising increased 7.5%.","To be sure, we did not have soft year-over-year comps like some of our peers. In the third quarter of last year, our advertising revenue was up a healthy 10%, with minimal impact from the Olympics. The decline in digital advertising marked a temporary pause in the 15th consecutive quarters of growth experienced by our lifestyle category leading websites. Driving this temporary pause in our quarterly growth was the planned reorganization of our digital sales group. We reorganized the group to better take advantage of the growth in mobile, digital video advertising, and our uLive video distribution network and website. This new sales organization should better allow us to maximize our peer-leading websites, as well as our unique advertising-supported uLive video platform. With this new organization, we expect to quickly resume our quarterly growth trajectory.","Now turning to affiliate fees. Revenues were up 8.9%, which were positively impacted by the reduction in launch fee amortization and the Amazon digital distribution deal. Lifestyle media segment expenses were up 8.9% on higher expected programming cost. As a result, segment profit was up 6.7% from the prior-year period.","Our international businesses generated $20 million of revenue and that was included in our third quarter consolidated results. This was up considerably from the prior year, primarily due to the Asian Food Channel acquisition. We also generated $15 million of equity in earnings of affiliates, up from $11 million last year, with our international partnerships in Canada and United Kingdom contributing about half of the growth.","Turning to the balance sheet. We repurchased 46,000 shares of our own stock during the third quarter at an average price of $68.33 a share for total expenditure of $3.1 million. As you no doubt noticed, we took a step back from our buyback program in the third quarter. As we've indicated in the past, we actively evaluate our repurchase program relative to our other investment opportunities, and none of those materialized in the quarter. We'll continue to be deliberate in our capital deployment and return of capital to generate positive shareholder returns. And as you know, we look at this on a quarterly basis.","We ended the third quarter with $557 million in cash, including the $225 million we generated in free cash flow during the third quarter. And with that, operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question, it comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess, 2 questions. The first is, you said that you sort of didn't see the opportunity in the quarter for the buyback. So I guess the question is really, what defines the opportunity? What -- like is there a price at which you find it compelling? Or what are the parameters around that decision-making process? And then second, I think when you really started launching the digital initiatives, particularly, CityEats and uLive, I think you talked about how if you didn't see proof of concept in these initiatives and how they were moving toward the level that you wanted, you might become less enthusiastic about them over time. And so, I guess, I wonder like where are you with those operations in terms of profitability? Can you talk about that?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes. David, this is Joe. I'll take both of those and then maybe we'll get some color on uLive from Burton. The opportunity comment in the script was meant to highlight alternative opportunities to the buyback program. We continue to believe our stock is a great investment opportunity for us. We were looking at some alternatives in the quarter, it's no secret. And we were not -- we ended up not pulling the trigger on the alternatives. So that accounts for the pause in the program. It has nothing to do with our view of the attractiveness of the stock. And as you know, we look at that on a quarterly basis with the board, and we'll do it again this quarter. We have a meeting next week. So I don't think you should read anything into -- about our view on the price or the current price or where it's been, where it's going. We continue to believe it's a great investment opportunity for us. Secondly, on the digital initiatives, I think you're exactly right, and we do have that same discipline as we think about both of the initiatives you mentioned. With respect to CityEats, I'd say it's fair to -- that we've concluded that the path forward there would involve a partnership either with respect to distribution and\/or local marketing for us. So you'll see us moderate spending there. I think that's in line with our discipline around these sorts of investments. And I think that -- so I'd look for improvement there. With respect to uLive, I'll let Burton comment.","Burton Jablin","Well, on uLive, let's remember it launched only in June. That was a soft launch. The hard launch was really just about a month ago. Since then, we're seeing nice audience growth, nice growth in the viewing of our digital video content. Of course, that's the goal of uLive, more digital video views. And so right now, we're feeling good about it.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Janedis with UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","With some of the ratings choppiness in Food, how should we think about the fourth quarter? Will you possibly up marketing? Could there be some content write-offs? And from what you see today, could on-air advertising grow in the high singles, in the lifestyle segment, given the comp to last year?","Kenneth W. Lowe","John, are you talking about Q4?","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Okay. Well, I'll let Burton take -- Burton, why don't you go ahead and take the Food ratings?","Burton Jablin","Yes, we're going to see sort of normal write-offs. That's not really something that's changed all that much. In terms of marketing, we have marketing going on in the fourth quarter. New programming coming on in the fourth quarter that we'll put some of that marketing behind. We've already launched one show in the fourth quarter to great success, Guy's Grocery Games on Sunday night. And so we're feeling pretty good about what's rolling out in this quarter.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Lori?","Lori A. Hickok","And I can echo what Burt said. As far as the write-offs, it's customary that we look at those things, nothing unusual there. It's really part of our year-end and quarterly process. As far as the revenue and the rates, again -- Food is a strong demand by advertisers. The pricing -- they'll continue to benefit from the pricing and the ratings and sales mix, so we're feeling really, really good, generally, about what we can do with that asset and what we can do in Q4.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, maybe a related question then. Burton, we're in option season, can you share what you're seeing there? Any categories that standout? How does the calendar upfront look? And actually, are you sold out at this point on Food for Q4?","Burton Jablin","Well, options are about as expected, no big change there. And managing inventory about the same as usual at Food Network. And what was the third part of that question?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Sold out for the quarter?","Burton Jablin","Yes. Well, we're managing that.","Lori A. Hickok","Yes. We're managing. It's very strong. I mean, it gets back to the demand for Food, and so they're still -- we continue to sell. But the demand is so strong that they're probably closing in on what they can do there as far as the pipeline.","Burton Jablin","Yes, I mean we're, what, halfway through the fourth quarter at this point.","Lori A. Hickok","Yes.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then calendar upfront, anything yet?","Burton Jablin","Nothing to report there yet. They're still in the process of closing that out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you give us an update on how we should think about the Food Network ratings versus the upfront commitments that you guys made? Obviously, the ratings look a little bit soft, but would it be fair to say, not weak enough that you would create a make-good situation? And then just my follow-up question is beside the well-discussed sort of potential buy-in of the rest of Food Network or Travel, could you maybe give us some color on what your priorities would be for further investments or acquisition activity?","Burton Jablin","I'll take the first part of that. Right now, we're looking at, as I said earlier, rolling out programming and marketing in the fourth quarter that we think will do what they need to in terms of ratings. We're seeing sequential declines in our year-over-year comparisons and so we feel good that we're moving in the right direction there. And so in terms of meeting our estimates, we're feeling okay, about that.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes. Alexia, I'll talk about investments for a minute. I think as you highlighted, our top priority would be, at the right price, to bring in the minority interests of both the Food Network and the Travel Channel. Beyond that, our next highest priority is the appropriate return of capital to shareholders. And beyond that, we're also looking at opportunities around the globe for investments where they're appropriate. We -- to be fair on that last point, we don't see anything of any significant size. One of the big assets that we all thought would be available in the next few years did come to market and was traded. Beyond that, though, we're looking at smaller investments in a number of markets, some of which we think are very attractive. As you know, some of these take time and we'll be patient about it. But if we're going to deploy capital, it will be likely in some attractive international investments.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffetNathanson.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","I have 2, maybe for Ken, but we'll see who he'll hand them off to. First is on Travel, change leadership of Travel. And I wonder what kind of changes should we expect, as viewers, to see on the air? So what was the direction you want to see versus what you're getting? And then secondly, just on the restructuring in digital, did you just -- was there a -- I mean, how did you go to market previously in digital? Was it part of your TV sales team? And did you just not, basically, have people in the market in the third quarter and then fourth quarter to reverse that? So just more color on what, actually, did you restructure and how did that actually affect the ad sale in the process?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Michael, let me jump on the digital, then I will let Burton handle the leadership question at Travel. No, we were very much in the marketplace, obviously. If you go back to late '90s, and we talk about this from time to time, we were one of the first cable network groups to set up a digital sales organization. And what's been interesting, it's given us a front-row seat to watch the changes that are going on, which have been pretty interesting over the past 12 to 18 months, specifically. And I think Joe alluded to this, as it has come to mobile, and it has come to other opportunities. And as these opportunities have presented themselves, I think we try to be agile enough to switch up and change a little bit and now under Beth Lawrence's leadership, we're extremely excited about the direction we're going and the opportunities in front of us, coupled with the launch of uLive, which was a directly -- a direct result of not only what we saw in our own research, but what was coming back from the marketplace as an opportunity. Jeff Meyer, who headed up digital ad sales for all those years, moved over to lead and is leading the uLive organization, and Beth Lawrence came in, in his place. So there was probably a little bit of a transition bump that maybe we should have anticipated better. But, overall, I think the answer is about the future. We feel really good how we're positioned right now, how we're selling, and we do have a separate sales force, obviously, that works hand in glove with Steve Gigliotti's total ad group. But right now, I feel very positive about it. Burton?","Burton Jablin","And on Travel Channel, what you're going to see there, really, is a tighter focus in terms of what we think will drive the brand identity there. And that's really an attempt to create programming, some of which is already on the air, that really is about adventure seeking, curiosity about the world, intrigue, some degree of mystery about experiences. And I'm working directly with the team there now. It's a great team that Laureen Ong put in place as she very successfully made the transition of Travel Channel into the Scripps Networks family. They are focused on creating this much tighter brand identity at Travel Channel. We still consider it our biggest growth opportunity, and I feel confident in their ability to pull it off.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So we're ending one TV season, starting a new one. Can you just walk me through the ad sales process in terms of how you bundle the networks and over what time periods you sell? So specifically, I seem to remember you indicating that each of the channels are sold individually, so one channel can't make up for another. And I also think that you sell across the entire season, right? So in the upfront, if ratings are better or worse in one quarter, they could be offset in another. And, I guess, the reason I asked the question is I'm looking at the Food revenue growth of only 2% in 3Q. And I'm wondering if sort of since it was the end of the TV season, you had to true-up with delivery for the year for just that network because they're not bundled, and that's why the revenue growth was only 2% as we start the new TV season and we start fresh. So I don't see how any of that made any sense, but I appreciate any comments.","Lori A. Hickok","Yes. Doug, I can address the last part of that. You're absolutely right. We do sell from a TV season, so we can make good from quarter-to-quarter within that. However, that had no impact on why Q3 was what Q3 was. But it is the advantage that we do sell it from quarter-to-quarter. Then we do sell, I would think you're pretty familiar, there's a broadcast upfront, which we sell and make estimates and that we're making those upfront. Then there's the broadcast calendar. And then we do the scatter and DR markets. So those are really the marketplaces in which we play. And we work closely with our category leaders in setting estimates and thinking what our impressions and our inventory is.","Burton Jablin","And I would add, there's also cooperation among the sales teams in the various categories as need be respecting [ph] clients, and that happens routinely.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So if I repeat that back, if I had that right, so the Food Network, sort of revenue growing 2% year-over-year in 3Q was really sort of just related 3Q items?","Lori A. Hickok","Just Q3 results. It's not because we were having to make good on things that we didn't make good in Q1, whether we go back to Q1 or Q2. It's not -- there's no true up and we just stop and we write checks.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And separately, the season's done so you start 4Q with a fresh slate and a fresh upfront sales base and new CPM's, right?","Lori A. Hickok","Absolutely.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a quick look at programming investment. We've heard about priorities at the Food Channel and a little bit about Travel. Lots of initiatives out there. As we think about the budgets that you put in place for -- to support all those initiatives, is there any reason we should think there could be any change in the pace of year-over-year dollar investments to support all those initiatives either -- in either direction, higher or lower? And then just a quick -- I've got somewhat related follow-up on Travel. As we watch Travel and we know your ambitions there to grow that, is it -- what sort of ratings progress should we be looking for? Or do you need to see, to sort of be on plan for where you want to take that thing? Or is that not a metric we should look at? I'm assuming that's one we should look at.","Lori A. Hickok","I'll take the first part of that question on the programming investment. One, is you know we're in the budget season, so as far as any comments and what we're looking at, as far as next year, we'll defer that to February. However, I wouldn't be expecting a major shift one way or the other as far as our cash spend, which is the balance sheet. We're pretty much moderating. We're looking at a certain amount of hours, and we have a pace and a plan for that. So we really have our procurement process around that, what we're putting on the air. But I don't expect it to drop off significantly. And again, keep in mind that we do have an investment in Travel, which does impact our year-over-year growth. We're continuing to invest in that, and we have always said that we are not going to manage margins, that we will do the right thing to grow those ratings. So we are focused on what we're doing at Travel. We would expect continued investment there. And of course, we're looking at Food and what we can do there. But again, I'm not looking -- and we'll tell you more in February.","Burton Jablin","And, I guess, what I would say on the ratings is Travel is a long-term opportunity for us, just as it took quite a while for us to build the HGTV into the powerhouse it is today and the same with Food Network. We expect Travel Channel to be a powerhouse. But we're going to do it the right way, where we build an audience that connects with the brand that delivers high-quality consumers that we sell the premium in the ad sales marketplace. That's more important to us than any quick fixes.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm going to move to the smaller networks. Did you guys see revenue was down, like, almost 6% in the quarter, but it had been up double digits in first and second? Just curious why such a strong reversal?","Burton Jablin","I can start in on that, and then Lori can chime in. Part of it is we are changing the focus on what we're doing at GAC. And we're making it more of a lifestyle network, and as we do that, we might see some shifting in the way that we're conducting our advertising sales. But we feel good about the new lifestyle focus, and we'll begin to see that play itself out, we think, very positively. Lori?","Lori A. Hickok","And just to make sure, Jessica, I understood your question, because GAC is the only one with negative results. I thought you referred to all of the networks. Actually, DIY and Cooking Channel are doing quite well, double-digit growth. I want to make sure I didn't misunderstand your initial question.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","No, that was GAC.","Lori A. Hickok","Okay, okay.","Lori A. Hickok","And then -- I'm sorry, was there anything else on that or?","Lori A. Hickok","-","No. That was it.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then the second thing, I just -- you mentioned in the prepared comments that Asian Food Channel has been, I guess, restructured or it's kind of where you want it to be. Can you give us a little bit more color on how big that can -- how meaningful that can be? And maybe just some of the key international markets -- would you talk about progress that you made?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Sure. First, with AFC, I think, it's probably premature to say exactly how big it can be. It is -- it was, obviously, one single channel distributed in a number of markets. As you know, we put one of our most promising executives over there to help us get that channel distributed, but also turn that into a suite of 3 channels in the region. And there's a lot of work being done on getting distribution, not just for AFC, but also for Food Network Asia and also -- and for Travel Channel International, which has some Asian distribution, early days there. So lots of work going on there. We think there's great potential for the 3-networks suite and maybe more down the road, if we have a chance to launch, maybe, a more general lifestyle network as well. And the markets in Southeast Asia, I think you can probably rattle them off as easily as I can. We're very well penetrated in Malaysia, but there's great opportunity in a number of other markets there as well. And so I think we look forward to reporting progress in Asia on the quarterly calls as we go forward. With respect to other markets, there's a fair amount of activity, discussions and a launch plan underway in Latin America. It's premature to give you any dimensions on that just yet, but very excited about the receptivity of distributors there to some of our food content. So we look forward to good things there. And then, of course, we're going to continue to work very hard in Europe and Eastern Europe to build penetration, especially, on Travel but also on the Food Network there. So I think we have not changed focus in terms of our priority markets and our willingness to invest. And we are, as always, looking at a combination of acquisitions, organic launches and maybe joint ventures as well.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can I have just one quick follow up on everybody's earlier questions. So given what you said about -- and this a capital returns question. But given what you said about strategic opportunities, it does seem like Q4 should be back to more of a normalized buy back. I'm just wondering, will there be a catch-up period as well?","Joseph G. NeCastro","I appreciate the question. I don't want to get ahead of our board on that, so stay tuned, but I would expect us to get back in the market.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Research","My question is, actually, on HGTV. We've seen kind of double-digit growth for a few quarters at that network. Can you just comment about how sustainable that is, and whether or not we can actually see an acceleration in growth? And how much of the strength is actually just being housing-driven versus programming?","Burton Jablin","Well, this is Burton. Certainly, the housing market helps create greater positive point of view in the part of consumers about their homes and the whole housing market, so we believe there is a benefit. But I wouldn't want to overstate it because during the housing downturn, you may recall, HGTV's ratings didn't go down. They just remained flat. So that's part of it. But I think the main part is that the programming team and -- under the President of the Home category, Kathleen Finch, has put on some really strong shows. It gets down to what TV is all about. And in terms of the advertising revenue, what we've said, viewers [ph] forever, at Scripps Networks is true. The audience at HGTV is one of the best, if not the best in the television industry: upscale, educated, lots of money to spend and advertisers are willing to pay for that.","Operator","Next, we'll go to line of David Joyce with ISI Group.","David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Is there anything structural that could prevent Cooking or DIY from reaching Food or HGTV-like scale in time? Or is it just the matter of taking some near-time and, particular, corporate focus like you're doing now with the Travel Channel?","Burton Jablin","When you say scale, do you mean in terms of distribution or ratings or both?","David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just the distribution, the size of the revenue, ad and affiliates, sure.","Burton Jablin","Well, in terms of distribution, we are on tiers, as you know. And we grow all those networks as quickly as those tiers grow out. We always work with our distributors to do what we can to help support efforts to have people sign up for those tiers because, obviously, we want as many people viewing those networks as our distribution partners do as well. But that is a confining aspect of the growth potential in terms of distribution. In terms of ratings, as we've seen from recent successes like Holmes Makes it Right, and most recently, in the fourth quarter, Vanilla Ice Goes Amish, a show I hope you've all seen. It's quite a good show actually, did phenomenally in the ratings. It was the highest-rated original show that DIY Network has ever put on. And so, really, we see that there is upside on those networks, but we have to be realistic about them in terms of the distribution. That does create something of a limit.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two topics. First, Ken, your comments about the passion of viewers for lifestyle brands being equivalent to sports. I thought that was interesting and the first time I heard it. Could you share a bit more of what you're seeing -- what the data showed on the sports side, as well as lifestyle? Like did -- are you talking about the beta test and the 20% number? And was that the same as what you saw for sports? I'd love just some more detail or color on that passion comment. And then, secondly, I'm interested if you'll speak at all about your decision to not make an investment in Chellomedia, given your international objectives and commitment to growing there. It seemed like maybe it was a good fit. Was it the assets? Was it price? Why did you pass on that?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Okay, I'll let Joe take the second question, Mike. On the first question, yes, let me be clear. No, the comment I made about the passion relative to our lifestyle content versus sports did not come out of the beta research. And if I misstated that, I apologize. That would have been incorrect. It's more our internal research, Mike. And in some ways, I mean, this is nothing new. We've seen this almost from day one, since we launched HGTV. The word that constantly, pretty much the female viewers have used is, \"I'm addicted to your programming.\" And the parallel is very much like what you see in sports teams and personalities and really connecting to them, following them on social media. We see that with our personalities, but more importantly, I think we see it with the passion that people have for the category. For example, Burton alluded to earlier, you are very passionate about your home, you're passionate about your cooking, you're passionate about what you eat, how you eat it, and the same is true with travel. There's a real passion connection there, and that's why we have that really high engagement. That's why when you hear things like 94% of our viewing is live, that's how we liken it to sports viewing, because it is here and now that people want to see it as opposed to DVR and watch it later. So there's a lot of connectors there, and it serves us well. And it has certainly served us well in the advertising community where we're recognized for that passion and that engagement. So I hope that helps. I will say there are some females that don't necessarily like to be compared to males' passions when it comes to sports, when it comes to the home and food categories, but I'll leave that for another time. Joe, do you want to take the second part of that?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Sure. Mike, on Chello, I think it's hard to say there's exactly one reason or one specific reason. It's always the combination of factors. Clearly, we were not there on the value that it ultimately traded for. We could have been had the asset been stronger for us. And again, without making a comment as to whether or not the asset was great or not so great, it was a large collection of things, some of which were much more attractive than others. When you put it all together, we could not get to the value that they were looking for.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just had a question on the Travel Channel. I think it was a couple of years ago, you guys talked about maybe having shorter-term renewals on your affiliate deals for Travel with the hope of investing some money, getting new programming, having the ratings go up and then going back and renegotiating. Are you still pursuing that sort of short-term strategy with the hope of near-term lift? Because I think I heard you describe earlier in the call that you sort of see the Travel opportunity maybe as a bit longer in duration than, at least, I was thinking about a few years ago.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes, let me grab that. This is Joe. In fact, we did that. And if you looked at where our Travel aspirations were a year ago and where they are now, we ended up pushing out a lot of those as a part of other renewals that we had underway. So any time we were at the table with any of our distributors, that was obviously part of the conversation. We essentially pushed out those deadlines to give us a chance to make the programming investments and see ratings improvements.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So everything is sort of coterminous now?","Joseph G. NeCastro","When you say it's all coterminous, but we did push them out a year or 2.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laura Martin with Needham Capital.","Laura A. Martin - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, a couple of things. One is -- one of the things we heard yesterday is that the market -- Les believes that the market is going to be at C7 this year and by this year's upfront. And, I guess, the question is if 94% of your viewing is live, what kind of lift do you guys get in the first 3 days? And does moving to C7 affect you much less than the rest of the -- your competitors?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Laura, it's Ken. I pretty much tend to agree with Les on C7 as far as timing. We'll see. I mean, there's still some things to work out there. But specifically, your question, obviously, with that much viewing done live, C7 probably won't give us as much lift as you're seeing kind of across all networks. But I would say this, I think over the longer term there could be some possibilities because what we're seeing -- and Burton and I were just talking about this before the call, and this is a general statement. On Sunday nights, there's so much viewing that we're seeing a heavy DVR usage. So I think it's good for the industry, by the way, that we're moving to C7 for sure. But short term, we don't see a huge lift for us, to be honest with you.","Laura A. Martin - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, very helpful. And then on SVOD, one of the things that came out of the Time Warner -- the Time Warner guys said that they were going to do $350 million this year of SVOD at flat. And then the Les said his was higher, so I think his was about $500 million of SVOD, equally split between Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. And he is growing -- he's up a lot. And what's new about him is he's selling new content into that, so $50 million to Netflix, 4 seasons in Dexter. So we're adding to the library product. My question for you guys is when you think about your SVOD deals, can you size it for us and\/or tell us what you think the upside is there? Or is this a case, again, where the live -- the nature of your programming is inherently different, so you guys can't quite benefit as much from SVOD upside, as some of these other deep library companies?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Laura, I love it when you answer your own questions? I do think we have taken a different move, a different view. As you know, we were slower to the market. We were sobered by some of the effect we had seen on ratings when some of the -- when some of our peers put what we thought was too much content up, too quickly. So we did start slowly. We did the Amazon deal this year. We're actively considering increasing the size of that deal, but again, with some discipline around it. We don't believe that we have exactly the kind of programming that works for -- as a hit on Netflix. We think it's good library content. It'll attract an audience. We're getting good traction, Amazon results, but you're not going to see us go all in with a Netflix deal.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Ben Mogil with Stifel.","Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of them have been asked already. So I just wanted to talk to you about the ad trends that you're seeing in the quarter. Are you seeing 4Q on the spot, sort of decelerate a little bit? And is there anything we should be reading into that one way or another?","Burton Jablin","Well, as Joe mentioned earlier, we're seeing fourth quarter scatter year-to-year comparisons up, mid single digits. Fourth quarter scatter compared to upfront, up midteens. That seems pretty healthy at this point.","Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then sort of following on Laura's question with SVOD. I know in the beginning you were, obviously, sort of not hesitant, but in the beginning you sort of did a smaller deal just to get a better sense of how this thing kind of rolled off -- rolled out from the live side. With the live ratings as strong as they are, as you go forward do you feel that you can have an expanded SVOD platform and still keep those great live ratings?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, I think it's a little early, Ben, for us. If you remember the last quarterly call, I commented about that we were pretty pleased with what we found out in the Amazon deal to this point. But again, to echo what Joe said, we are being cautious about it. But I think the general answer is yes. But we'd like to have a little more research and a little bit more experience under our belt.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alan Gould with Evercore.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just want to follow up on the scatter-versus-scatter. I noticed that the 4Q went to mid-single digits from the 3Q mid- to high-single digits. So just wondering if the deceleration is due to ratings? Is that you or is that whole industry? And then second question and more longer term is Food ratings. So Food ratings have been down for each month for about the last year or so. So I guess the good news is that comps were getting easier, but I was wondering, what's causing that and what gives us confidence that, that could -- we'll see a turn there?","Burton Jablin","On the first one, there was some softness last year in fourth quarter, so this does not seem to be a big surprise in what we're seeing in fourth quarter compared to third on scatter. In terms of Food Network, we've seen rating slumps before at all of our networks, and I would imagine, we're in good company with other peers out there in that regard. And so, really, it's a matter of programming through it. And as I look at what shows have come on to the third quarter that have been very successful, we named some of them earlier -- Rachael vs. Guy's: Kids Cook-Off, Cutthroat Kitchen, in particular, Great Food Truck Race -- and the ratings of those can draw. Those are certainly every bit as high as what we were seeing a year ago with hits on Food Network. Same is true for Guy's Grocery Games in the third quarter -- I'm sorry, the fourth quarter. And we just put on a new show called Restaurant Express this past Sunday, so we've got hopes for that one too. And there's more coming in the fourth quarter. There's been increased competition in the food space over the last year. We are adjusting to that, and it's all about programming our way out of it. And I'm confident we can do that.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Was there, typically, a lag from when these new shows come on until they build an audience, I would assume?","Burton Jablin","It depends, and that's a good question. With some shows, we need to be patient, allow it to find its audience. We're doing that with a few of them, but some of them do very well right a way. A couple of them that I named, Cutthroat Kitchen, Guy's Grocery Games, very strong right out of box. And so what we'll do there is, of course, get more of them on the air.","Operator","Now we go to the line of Barry Lucas with Gabelli & Company.","Barry L. Lucas - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Not to beat the Food issue to death here, but you've got a sequential decline in revenues, and I'm just wondering how much of that was, again, related to the ratings softness? Or did, somehow, Food suffer disproportionately on the digital advertising side?","Burton Jablin","It didn't suffer disproportionately. That wasn't the issue. In terms of television ratings, we certainly need to see those grow. And as I just said in answer to the last question, I think we're on track to do that.","Barry L. Lucas - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. Second item, and our favorite topic is Tribune and the Food Network stake. They've got a lot stuff on their plate, potential separation of the newspaper business and a $3 billion acquisition. Wouldn't that argue for them to be a little bit more eager to come to the table, particularly with that the local TV deal?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Gary, this is Joe. I love that there's a new way to ask that question, every time. I would have to agree with the way you're thinking about it, but it's really too early to say that I've seen anything that would indicate that.","Barry L. Lucas - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. Let me put on my conspiracy theory hat and the ratings in Food -- and some people might, if they were cynical, say you're sandbagging the numbers.","Burton Jablin","Don't tell that to the programming and marketing teams there. They're in the battle every day to grow the ratings, and that's what they're there to do.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Let's be clear. We do everything we can to maximize the value of all of our networks. There are 69% of the owners of that network that we would rather have very happy than try and submarine the price on 31%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities.","Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","The other thing that's interesting in the measurability is your demographics, obviously, and the deal that you're doing with Rentrak on the granularity and the set-top box data. And I know you're about as sophisticated as anybody on the advertising intermesh on the demographics in the homes, but can you talk about the upside there and what you might be using that data for?","Burton Jablin","Well, part of it is to try to look at demographics as it relates to purchasing. If you can make those links, obviously, that's kind of a Holy Grail in terms of unlocking even greater value from the wonderful audience that we already have. I think it's just part of an effort to get more and more data which, as we all know in this world, is critical to making sure that you can get the greatest value out of your audiences.","Operator","Now we go to the line of Tuna Amobi with S&P Capital IQ.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","First question, so Ken, I think you guys have this very interesting, what I might call, self-supporting syndication model, in that you are able to effectively monetize a lot of these shows as opposed to kind of licensing them out, much like your peers. So I guess, I'm trying to understand how you make those kinds of trade-off decisions as you go through these renewals, and where you see those kinds of -- for lack of a better word, monetization gap, between third-party license and self-syndicated shows, where you see the biggest opportunity in terms of which networks or even which shows? That would be helpful and if you can enlighten me on the thought process for that.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Well, I think, Tuna, if you go back to how these networks were put together, that was the idea from the get go and that is a 24\/7 brand. And I think, quite honestly, that's why we have the high amount of live viewing that we do, because people tend to turn these networks on and leave them on, especially if you're into the category. So we've never really looked at the syndication model per se, like broadcast does where first run might be on network, and second could be on a cable network. And now that model, if you go back to Laura's question, I think is evolving and changing as well through SVOD. But for us, it really is about monetization because, to your point -- and this also goes back to the earlier question. Our ability to monetize on the advertising side with the audience we target and the demographics and psychographics we deliver, really give us more value on our own than we can get in the syndication market, assuming there would be much of a market for that type of programming. So yes, you're right. We are our own self-syndicators. It works very well. I don't see that radically changing. It's more about downloading video, in particular, projects, particular types of cooking, things like that, that we see in the digital world is where there could be some incremental revenue. Does that help answer your question? I guess it did.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions in queue.

Thank you, Mark, and good morning everyone. We're coming up another great quarter driven by our ability to attract and engage upscale audience with our unique lifestyle content.","The company performed particularly well delivering strong growth in advertising and affiliate revenues, record viewership at HGTV, DIY Network and the Cooking Channel, positive audience trends in Travel Channel and Food Network and a growing contribution from our international businesses.","Now, looking ahead in 2014, we expect to increase shareholder value through a healthy increase in advertising revenue fueled by growing audiences at our networks and a strong advertising market, focused investments and programming at all of our networks coupled with modest growth in other expenses. Continued international expansion and improved utilization of our balance sheet through an enhanced share repurchase program and increased dividend.","Now, underpinning the company's success is our concentration on the home, food and travel lifestyle categories and the world-class brands that they represent.","The engaging brands that we bring to life everyday really stand apart from the pack, if you will. Our networks are truly different. They're delivering quality in lifestyle programming that we think outshines the competition on television and the expanding array of mobile video platforms. So, no matter what screen they choose, media consumers recognize the distinctive nature of our programming and they seek it out.","That was evident really in last year's record ratings at HGTV, DIY Network and Cooking Channel as well as in positive audience trends throughout our portfolio, including a double-digit increase in the weekend viewing at Food Network.","Advertisers and media buyers also give us high marks for our creative platforms. For example, in a recent Beta Research Study, Scripps Networks Interactive ranked number one for providing creative and innovative multi-platform advertising opportunities, those unique attributes that Scripps Networks applied from its peers in a big way. Our networks performed outstandingly in the quarter, driving the company's stellar performance, no where is that more evident than in the home category.","In the fourth quarter, we continue to see the strong viewership trends at HGTV and DIY that they really experienced throughout 2013.","Fourth quarter closed out the best year ever for HGTV and DIY, while December tied as the highest rated ever, by the way, to the end of the year. New shows like Hawaii Life, Beachfront Bargain Hunt, and Cousins Undercover compliment favorites like House Hunters, Love It or List It and Property Brothers, and it really helped to contribute to HGTV's strong audience growth.","Also, we've got a full pipeline of returning shows like Rehab Addict, along with new programs like Island Hunters, Flip It to Win It and the Brian Boitano project that should extend our audience momentum well into 2014 and throughout the year.","This record-breaking popularity was not just complaint to the network. Ad week, named HGTV Magazine, the year's 0536 hottest newcomer, and the magazine topped one million in circulation. Digital continues to grow in popularity importance.","In 2013, the HGTV websites attracted more than 4.3 billion pageviews, up 20%, and we've launched a new HGTV YouTube Channel, which is called HGTV Handmade, and that's designed to appeal the young lineal consumers.","Like HGTV, DIY Network enjoyed the most successful year in its history in 2013, and December by the way broke records as the Network's highest rated month; another great way to end the year.","Homes makes it right, attracted record audiences and other titles like I Want That experienced double-digit audience growth as well.","Based on the popularity of establishing a new programming, we believe HGTV and DIY Network are on course for another great year in 2014.","Now, you know the Food Network is growing really into a cultural icon, a highly recognized brand. And it finished 2013 on a very positive note. December audiences were up versus 2012 while the fourth quarter overall was levelled with year ago helping drive this improvement or new programs like Alton Brown's Cutthroat Kitchen, hope you had a chance to see it, is a great show. Guy's Grocery Games, another wonder. Farmhouse Rules and Southern at Heart, which is hosted by Food Network star winner, Damaris Phillips returning stalwarts like Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives and Chopped also contributed to the network success.","That positive trend, I'm happy to say it's continued into 2014 helped in part by the new season the tremendously successful Rachel versus Guy Celebrity Cook-Off which started airing in early January. And we are equally enthusiastic about the pipeline of new programming that will air through the rest of the first quarter and beyond like Beat Bobby Flay. It's a great show. Rachel raised three in the back and the new season of Worst Cooks in America.","Meanwhile the Cooking Channel, new programs like Restaurant Redemption and Best in Chow grow some very strong audience growth. Food Network and Cooking Channel applies for a strong 2014 and we will continue to help shape America's conversation about food for years to come.","Our Travel Channel, we are making steady progress reaching larger and larger viewing audiences. We finished the fourth quarter on a positive note with December showing strong gains on key nights. They are helping to drive this performance, was a broad slate of program including new seasons of Bizarre Foods America and the Mysteries at the Museum, each realizing their best rated year ever.","Now, we expect this positive momentum to continue in 2014 with a host of new programming and episodes of some successful returning series. Travel Channel will also bring back its biggest annual programming event sweepstakes. And that is the Trip 2014. It's in the spirit really of HGTV's Green Home, so the lucky winning travellers with get away on a green itinerary valued at a $100,000 associated by Adam Richman, Don Wildman, Anthony Melchiorri and Samantha Brown.","The Trip 2014 features a collection of activities only Travel Channel could curate. So we hope you all will enter early and are off into win this amazing prize, and in some cases, get out of some lousy winter weather.","One more note on Travel Channel, we trust you saw our press release last week announcing Shannon O'Neill's appointment as President of the network. I am extremely excited about Shannon and his opportunity. He has been one of the driving forces behind the momentum we've created at Travel. As Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the network over the past three years, he has been very central to its strategic direction and development. Shannon provides us with a strong leadership and continuity that we need to build Travel into another powerhouse lifestyle brand.","And internationally, the fourth quarter capped off a very successful year with viewers around the world valuing our highly differentiated and entertaining program. In the U.K., Travel Channel's audience increased 57% year-over-year while Food Network remain the most watched lifestyle television brand in the country. And we are making steady progress expanding our footprint and the new launches of Travel Channel in Russia, Poland and the Philippines underscore that.","Asian Food Channel meanwhile initiated service in Vietnam and Taiwan. And as we recently announced, we are launching service in Italy under the Fine Living brand utilizing programming from the vast Scripps library that really encompasses all of our popular lifestyle networks.","So there you have it, Scripps Networks Interactive continues to grow led by the global popularity of our lifestyle networks and driven by pure leading operating results.","With all that, let me now turn it over to Joe and Lori to discuss the financial results. Joe?","Joseph NeCastro","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I am going to touch on some of the fourth quarter and full year highlights. Lori will then provide some color on what drove our strong results. She will discuss our 2014 full year guidance. Then I will come back and make some final comments on capital allocation before we open it up for questions.","Starting with the consolidated view, total revenue was up 8% on growth and advertising and affiliate fee revenue. Total segment profit was up 3%, which reflects the revenue growth partially offset by the expected higher programming and marketing expenses and our international and digital investments.","Net income attributable to SNI was $0.90 per share before $0.17 per share goodwill write-down related to our Travel Channel international business.","In the fourth quarter 2012, we reported $0.91 per share before net adjustments were $1.11. A slight decrease in year-over-year EPS due to higher amortization expense and a slightly higher effective tax rate experienced in the fourth quarter of 2013.","For the full year, revenue was up 10% to $2.5 billion driven by 10% growth in both advertising and affiliate fee revenue. Strong growth in advertising revenue reflects the highly desirable audience that we aggregate for our advertisers. It also reflects the success of our strategy to create relevant programming focused on the valuable Home, Food and Travel consumer categories.","These attributes resulted in industry leading CPM increases in the 2013-2014 upfront and the very healthy scatter market that we experienced for most of 2013. A strong increase in affiliate fee revenue reflects the annual escalators in our affiliate agreements, reduction in launch fee amortization, the online distribution agreement that we announced at the beginning of last year and our recent international acquisitions.","Segment profit increased 6% in 2013, reflects the ongoing investments in programming, international and digital initiatives.","Earnings per share attributable to SNI were $3.57 excluding the Travel Channel international write down while full year 2012 net income was $3.33 per share excluding the $1.11 of net adjustments.","Now, I am going to turn the call over to Lori. She will discuss the drivers in these results.","Lori Hickok","Thanks, Joe. Looking at key revenue drivers for the fourth quarter, advertising was up 9% and affiliate fees were up 10% versus last year. These were partially offset by a decline in other revenues due to the reduction of some international licensing agreement.","Advertising revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven by the strength of the 2013-2014 upfront market. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing across the networks was up mid single digits year-over-year and up low teens over the broadcast upfront.","For the advertising categories our top five were Food, retail, financial, consumer package goods and auto. So far in the first quarter the advertising market have strengthened a bit. Our advertising partner's tone is positive about 2014.","First quarter year-over-year Scatter-versus-scatter pricing growth is running in the mid to high single digits and in the low to mid teens over the 2013 broadcast upfront. But we have a strong calendar upfront market developing for 2014 and cancellations are running at normal level.","Affiliate revenues grew 10% in the fourth quarter driven by the items Joe previously mentioned for the full year. Looking at our network performance in the U.S., revenues were up 7.6% on the strong advertising and affiliate fee growth, and our advertising revenues were up 7% driven by the pricing increases I previously mentioned.","Affiliate fee revenues were up 9%. Lifestyle media segment expenses were up 10% on the expected higher programming cost and marketing expense. And as a result segment profit was up a healthy 5.2% from the prior year period.","Our international businesses generated $21 million of revenue included in our fourth quarter consolidated results. This was up 9% from the prior year primarily due to the Asian Food Channel acquisition.","In the fourth quarter 2013, we reported a 24.7 million goodwill impairment charge for our Travel Channel international business that primarily reflects floor expansion into some of the growth markets identified for the business ad acquisition. However, we remain positive about the longer term trajectory of the business and the potential to create value that's reflected in the original business case.","Equity and earnings of affiliates with 18.5 million up from 14.6 million last year. Our international partnership in Canada and United Kingdom comprise slightly more than half of the earnings. So overall a great finish for the network both domestically and internationally in 2013 driven by positive trends that we expect will continue into 2014.","So now, looking at our 2014 guidance, we expect total revenue to be between 6% and 8%. This increase reflects affected advertising revenue growth in the high single digits driven primarily by the healthy advertising market we previously noted.","For affiliate fee revenue in 2014, keep in mind, we don't have any material renewals that will impact 2014 and also we won't have any one time benefit from our reduction in launch fee amortization as we did in 2013. So we expect affiliate revenues to increase approximately 5% which includes international and our digital distribution agreement.","For expenses, cost of sales, cost of services are expected to increase between 11% and 13% as we continue to invest in programming to drive viewership at all our networks and digital businesses.","Selling, General and Administrative expenses are expected to be flat to up 2%. Excluding marketing, SG&A expenses are expected to be down slightly to flat. For both the revenues and expenses, we expect the first quarter to be the highest percentage growth quarter of the year. The expectation is for revenue to grow in the high single digits while expenses are expected to grow in the low teen.","In the subsequent quarters we expect the growth rates for both revenue and expenses to trend down and excluding the investments and international expansions in digital initiative, we expect the margins on our core business to expand for the full year 2014.","Other items we have offered guidance on today are as follows. Depreciation amortization will be between 120 million and 130 million. Interest expense will be approximately 50 million. Our effective tax rate between 30% and 32% and non-controlling share of net income between a $190 million and $200 million, and capital expenditures in the range of $80 million to $85 million.","So now, let me turn the call back over to Joe for some final comments on capital before we open the lines up for questions.","Joseph NeCastro","Thanks, Lori. I am sure most of you saw the announcement we made last night significantly increasing both our share repurchase authorization as well as our dividend. Our board authorized another $1 billion for share repurchases under our current program, which has $647 million remaining in it. And we expect to be actively repurchasing throughout 2014.","The board also increased our annual dividend to $0.80 per share up from $0.60 per share in 2013. These actions reflect the strength and resiliency of our core business. Our expectations for continued free cash flow from the businesses and our investment plans going forward.","Management along with the board remains committed to creating value for our shareholders over long term, a commitment that's born out in the company's long and successful track record.","With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We have a question from John Janedis from UBS. Please go ahead.","John Janedis \u2013 UBS","Thank you, good morning.","Kenneth Lowe","Good morning, John.","John Janedis \u2013 UBS","Hi. You talked about the positive rating trends, the networks and with the program and cost guidance, are you increasing hours of Food or HG? And is it fair to say that it maybe a third of the increase for Travel this year?","Kenneth Lowe","John, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. Overall, we are not really increasing hours. I think what we have come to find is working for us is we are initiating some fewer initial episodes of new shows that we're testing before we green-light multiple episodes. So you may see the overall hours moving around a little bit, but nothing significantly from what we have done in the past, the usual number of hours that you have seen us produce for HGTV for the Food Network are going to be pretty consistent.","There maybe a little uptick in hours on Travel as we continue to invest and trying more new things. But overall about the same number of hours. So of the investment is actually do more episodes of shows that are highly successful and have been proven. And there is a slight uptick in expenses in sometimes that are associated with those as you invest more in talent for the long-term etcetera and there is little bit of an overall price increase. But I think Lori framed it pretty well as far as programming expenses for the year.","John Janedis \u2013 UBS","That's helpful, thanks. Maybe, Lori, one for you. Can you just clarify the first quarter comment? You say that the first quarter should be the strongest for both advertising and affiliate fee growth. I mean when the ad comp is obviously a lot tougher. And so that's the case. What's behind the timing there?","Lori Hickok","What I said was that -- I said that revenue in general will be the strongest. Advertising will be stronger. That's typical. We have seen that year-over-year that first is strong. And then expenses, on that side, we always have that first year when you are crossing the year, you got a full year of employees, your employee merit increases, lots of things, and some marketing spend to promote our programming that we are putting on the air. We are quite bullish. So we actually didn't make a pretty deliberate decision to put some more marketing and some more programming on the airing in Q1. I think you are seeing some positive momentum from that if you have been watching our ratings.","Kenneth Lowe","And John, this is Ken. I think we are very encouraged by first quarter right now. We do a lot of trade shows with our advertising team Kitchen and Bath Show, National Hardware Show, the Homebuilder Show; we were at CES. And we felt very, very good about the feedback we are getting at all of those shows, and that's reflected, I think in Q1. So as the year goes on we are hoping that better news for you. But I think at this point to underscore that first quarter right now would appear to be our strongest, both appears to be wrong by the way. But right now that's what we are seeing.","John Janedis \u2013 UBS","Okay, thanks. In the past, Joe has said that the Olympics, at least summer got an impact. Are you saying for now, then at least for Olympics, no noticeable impact on the business?","Kenneth Lowe","We have actually performed better against the Olympics this year than we have in prior years, so very encouraged by that, especially Food.","John Janedis \u2013 UBS","Thanks very much, everybody.","Kenneth Lowe","Sure, John.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura","Thanks a lot. One for Joe and one for Ken. Joe, just first off, in terms of your guidance, I assume that doesn't it imbed any expectation for an SVOD deal. I think you guys had an Amazon deal last year that hasn't been renewed. Can you just clarify that and then just maybe give us a little bit of handicap as to what's going on there and is it possible that you do renew? And then I do have a follow-up. Thanks.","Joseph NeCastro","Yes, absolutely. The assumption reflected in the budget is that deal continues (inaudible) double revenue stream. So we are not assuming any big increase there. And the second part of that question, yes, we are optimistic that we will renew. We are in fact looking to expand the deal assuming we can get -- come up with favorable terms there. So I think that's a potential part of the money here and going forward.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura","Thanks. And then Ken, I think in the wake of the Comcast-Time Warner Cable, our announcement yesterday. They are a number of people out there that had suggested that, that merger of greater scale for those big companies may force you guys to consider your strategic options on a longer term basis in terms of consolidation. And so I am wondering just in the wake of that big announcement for this industry, I mean how do you think about how it could impact Scripps Networks. Thanks.","Kenneth Lowe","Sure. Anthony, I think it's a fair question. And of course this whole issue of Time Warner hit the news quite a bit, especially from what was initially a Charter standpoint. Our viewpoint really is this is one of the aspects that makes it a pretty interesting industry, makes our jobs fairly interesting because the landscape is always changing. Consolidation as long as I have been in this business is a fact of life. My Gosh, I go back to when Scripps actually owned cable systems which ironically we sold to Comcast.","But at the end of the day, we very much believe in the TV Everywhere model gives authenticated customers of our distributors' access to our content on big and small screens. And I think Anthony, you heard us say, we have been very aggressive in TV Everywhere. We are about 70% of our entitled base where -- as far as TV Everywhere, accessibility is still in the early innings. But we think long term TV Everywhere is going to positively impact our industry from a content standpoint. We are a content company, it's what we do. I will put our track record up against anybody. We do it better than anybody in my biased opinion. We will continue to do so no matter what the distribution environment.","And I think when you put out quality content you can always get a fair price. And it will play out. But right now nothing really changes in our game plan. We are focused on three incredible categories in Home, Food and Travel. And I think you are going to see another banner here in 2014.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura","Thanks guys. Have a good weekend.","Kenneth Lowe","Thank you, Anthony.","Operator","Next question is from David Joyce with International Strategy and Investments. Please go ahead.","David Joyce - International Strategy and Investments","Thank you. Lori, if you could give us some color on how advertising has been trending in some of your other markets. You did talk about obviously the viewership up in Travel Channel in the U.K and advertising tracking that, how are things going at least in Food Channel for example?","Joseph NeCastro","This is Joe. Advertising is a smaller portion of the business internationally. We'd say we have the most experience in the U.K. market and I think you characterized it there, it is obviously a range-driven market, it's structured somewhat differently than the U.S. But it has been relatively positive. Some of the big players are up and down there. For instance all of our ad sales there, for instance U.K. TV are sold in connection with another provider there, a number of agencies there. And you are tied to have a performance, a group performance. But the market itself has been up slightly and I think that's a -- in the past year if they look forward into 2014 they are sort of assuming it's going to be flattish to up slightly there.","Ad markets to the rest of world are -- obviously they are up and down and we have less exposure there. So it's hard for me to comment on many of them.","David Joyce - International Strategy and Investments","Okay. And on the digital business side there is a little slippage there. Was that anything seasonal? Anything one time you could point? What should we think about that business line going forward?","Joseph NeCastro","Well, on the digital front yet, I think you are right to point that out. We had a similar situation late in the year last year and we talked about restructuring of our digital ad sales group into category alignment and you saw the announcement that we announced the new head of our digital group. I think that's going to board well for us. I think we have a lot of optimism as we pursue to the year, but we are still getting to the transition there.","David Joyce - International Strategy and Investments","Thank you very much.","Joseph NeCastro","Okay, David.","Operator","Next we have Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank","Thanks so much. I guess a couple of questions, the first, any update you want to give us on the potential for buy-in of the minority stakes either Tribune or Cox? And I guess I ask that partly because you mentioned stock buybacks throughout the year. So (few other) questions that imply that minorities were off in the future, do you have the capacity to do both?","And then the other question, I don't know how much I want to get into and I guess you probably don't, but is there any comment you can make if, to the extent that Comcast Time-Warner cable get together and what the sort of the one time impact in your affiliate revenue would from that type of merger. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.","Joseph NeCastro","Well, let me take the first one. This is Joe. On the minority stakes, there is really no change in our point of view on them. We fully expect that we can do both, and that was part of the consideration in the upsizing of the buyback authorization. I think there is no reason to believe that we couldn't handle all that activity in our current structure. And say, in terms of our foster there, there has really been no movement on neither. As you are aware there is an event, the Travel Channel minority piece owned by Cox, there is a (put) that connects this year and the call next year. So that will definitely happen. Tribune is still an open question for us. But we are committed to probably end it in some point in the right place.","Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank","Joe, as I mentioned, did you give a pace of what the buyback might be this year or you still left that open ended?","Joseph NeCastro","You did not miss it.","Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Kenneth Lowe","And Doug, it won't come as a surprise to you. I mean you have heard us say so many times in the past, we really don't comment on individual distribution deals etcetera. So it's very early and speculative anyway on a lot other stuffs. So you are right, I will pass on that to a later point. But I'll underscore again, I mean we are just very bullish on the long-term value of our company relative to the changes we are seeing in the distribution model and the more aggressive moves to TV ever requiring multiple screens. So both Comcast and Time-Warner certain have been aggressive and done a good job on that. So we will just continue to migrate content, and we will sit at the negotiating table like we always do.","Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank","All right. Thank you.","Kenneth Lowe","Thank you Doug.","Operator","Next question is from Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee","Thank you. I apologize if I missed it. But can you please tell us if online advertising was a drag or a tailwind this quarter. And then I have a question about advertising, given how different the growth rate and ratings are across the different networks. Do they all have approximately the same CPM? In other words, do you care where you are getting your (GRPs) from? If you could give us help, how to think about that would be very nice? Thank you.","Kenneth Lowe","Yes. Vasily, let me take the last part of that first and then Joe and Lori can weigh on the first question. Yes, obviously we care very much about CPMs, but we are a little unique and that we do have individual sales teams and all our categories. One of the primary reasons is the uniqueness that the Food category, the Home category and the Travel category all bring together. Having said that Steve Gigliotti who is just on a fantastic job for a number of years in keeping all of these different categories under toe, and it makes the decision from the top where to combine CPMs, where we can actively push down beyond endemics.","So, there is no one real answer there. I think our results speak for themselves because if you look at quarter-over-quarter, we are always near the top of the peer group in percentage increase and advertising quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. This quarter is no different. So, however, Steve mixes and matches. We are pretty pleased with the results. And then, I think the other aspect of that is the integrated sales that we do, which is very much in partnership with our advertisers. You heard me mention at the tradeshows we attend, we are very aggressive in that area. So I think it's again, my (bias to showing) definitely one of the best sales groups in the industry in Steve Gigliotti's leadership is just stellar. And that's going to continue right through '14 as well. And as you've heard we are off to a strong start in first quarter as far as our guidance.","Lori Hickok","And Vasily, the digital was a drag in the fourth quarter. But as Joe highlighted previously, that was just as we finished up the restructuring of our digital ad sales team and getting that ready. They got a great team together, Beth Lawrence and Steve Gigliotti have put together a fabulous team and they're ready to move into 2014. And so they will be organized and new systems in place.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee","Thank you. So you don't expect it to be a drag in '14?","Joseph NeCastro","No.","Kenneth Lowe","No.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee","Thank you very much. Have a good weekend.","Kenneth Lowe","All right. You too, Vasily.","Operator","Next question is from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, good morning. Thank you. I just want to ask about a couple of the growth initiatives you guys have identified. So I guess there is one question, two parts. First on international, I know there is a priority you talked about -- I just wondered, is there anything you could point to in terms of avenues of opportunity in the coming year that we could look for or think about for you guys to make some progress there. And to the extent we come on the M&A front, that's one of those things. I assume anything there would be incremental to your guidance.","The other one, I just wanted to ask a little more on Travel Channel. A little bit picking up on Vasily's question. I was just wondering what things we can look for to gauge the progress of your growth aspirations there as the year goes on, because the revenue is growing nicely, but more so than the ratings, so is there anything -- so how is that happening? Is there anything else we can look for other than the quarterly revenue to gauge the progress we make in that? Thank you.","Joseph NeCastro","Sure. I will handle the international piece and then Ken will talk to you about Travel Channel. We do have some launches planned in the year ahead both in Italy and Brazil. We very much look forward to getting those off the ground. We have not included any M&A estimate in the guidance that we have given that would be incremental. Obviously we are active as you know, and we continue to look at opportunities there. There is certainly nothing that we would be willing to discuss on a call like this or I will expect it to be this point. But we remain active and committed. We have certain regions of the world that we are more active and more interested in obviously. But the year ahead, what's in the guidance is our continuing operations and launches.","Kenneth Lowe","It's actually a really good question. And I'm so sorry Burton is not here with us today obviously because of not only the loss he and his family are experiencing. But because he should be answering this question because he should be giving credit for these positive trends we are seeing at the Travel Channel because his fingerprints are all over it. And along with Shannon's announcement there, we like what we see. I will just give you some examples, some schedule changes that Burton made recently as having positive impact.","For example, the weeknight 8 to 10 P.M. strip of Bizarre Foods of America's improved ratings there by 9% over the same period last year. Stacking series on more nights is leading to more consistency resulting and nice increases. For example, January compared to January 2013. Monday night is up 20%, Tuesday night is up 13%, Friday night is up 8%. January primetime adult 2554 rating demo 17% up over December of 2013, but here is really the nugget I think to your question. The average median income grew in January over December attracting more upscale audiences. And that's a key focus for us.","So while -- sometimes you look at our overall ratings, you have to dig down to understand it's upscale, it's highly motivated, it's engaging viewers, and that's what we have done at Food, that's what we have done at Travel. And that's at HGTV, but that's also our goal at Travel. It's not only to raise the ratings. Obviously, we're all about improving ratings, but it's improving the quality of the audience. And that's the thing to be mindful of as you see this go through the year. And quite frankly, that's why we're outperforming on revenue. And if you look at overall, if you compare our ratings with anybody else, it's not just the ratings number, it's the quality of the audience.","So if you want to cut a track, our progress on Travel, that's where it goes down through the quality and moving to more of an upscale audience and that's what Burton and Shannon and team are all going to be about in 2014.","Todd Juenger - Sanford Bernstein","That makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much, Ken.","Kenneth Lowe","I was hoping it did. I wasn't sure when I said it, but it sounded good. No. Its great thought and I'd say, I just cannot -- I just have to -- Father's pride here, I just have to get in a word about the great job Burton Jablin is doing in getting his arms, not only around travel, but all of our categories. He is a rising star in our industry, and deserves lot of credit. Sorry, he couldn't be here for obvious reasons.","Operator","Our next question is from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan","Hi, thank you, just something back to the international expansion and the opportunities there. When you look at the markets that you haven't yet penetrated specifically, I guess how much of it is because there is competitive dynamic already existing there, how much is it just sort of prioritizing, what make most sense for you guys, and therefore just a question of more time than actually whether or not going to get into those markets or not?","Joseph NeCastro","Yes. Alexia, this is Joe. I think obviously we consider all those things. The one aspect of the international business is that all the markets are, well, by definition smaller than in domestic market here. And so, as you look at them, they all have their own internal dynamics, competitive situation, regulatory situation, there is sometimes protections for the incumbents, there are ownership restrictions. So, all of that comes into play. As you know we've tried to identify three reasons of the world that we think are most important, and that we're going to focus on and part of that is because those regions are more attractive from those aspects and also from a demographic point of view.","The competitive set in a lot of these markets while sometimes there is lifestyle programming is not terribly daunting. We sell and have licensed a lot of programming around the world, and we find ourselves sometimes competing with our own programming until those deals runoff.","So we've been a lot more strategic about licensing programming so that we can launch with the full slate of our own library and some new stuff. So, all those things come into play. I think we're very deliberate about it. We're trying to be measuring on investments, and as you've heard we're planning two launches that will get off the ground in 2014, and hopefully more towards the end of the year as well. That's how we think about it.","Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan","Thank you. And just a follow-up on the programming expense guide for the year, is any times I guess if that should be sort of one-year number in terms of see that hike in programming senses you've to sort of catch-up or to reinvest in Travel everything else you had mentioned in the call, or is it more of a maybe a longer term trend where it maybe just given the increased competitions in general marketplace?","Lori Hickok","Hi, Alexia, this is Lori. I wish I could give you an answer as to what we think the long-term. But I think you've heard Ken talk about building audience back and forth ratings are important. So, we'll continue to invest into what we need to do on the screen. And of course we'd like to do it as cheap as possible. But in the end, when you see what we've done on the SG&A, we're really trying to control expenses there to keep funding where it really matters and that's on the screen and driving audiences in the top line.","So, we're doing the right things. We're still working and investing in Travel. We'll continue to see tight momentum in Food, and the competition is getting tougher. I mean if you just look for bringing out a gain everyday and trying to put the right product. So this is definitely our plan for the current year, and hopefully it will go down, but it would be really premature for me to even hypothesize on what programming rates we're going to be in two years.","Kenneth Lowe","Yes, and I'd like to add, it's always a fair question. But I think the one thing I'm encouraged about is we're getting better at being in contact with our audience. I think in social media interactivity, we do quite a large group called under one roof where we're constantly polling if you will, talking to our audiences about programming and the trends.","So, we've never had a better handle in my opinion on where the audience and the consumers want to see programming go, what's popular, what's trending, what's working. But as long as we got to get ROI, it's just a tough question to ask because you never want to say you won't continue to invest in quality programming, if it's bring you back a good return on investment. But at some point, there is probably a point of no return, whether its sports programming rights or whether its nonfiction rights, but we still look very comfortable with our ROI and programming investment.","Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan","Thank you very much.","Kenneth Lowe","Sure.","Operator","Next question is from Amy Yong with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Amy Yong - Macquarie","Thanks. Just following up on the international a little bit more. As that portfolio grows, can you talk about the impact to affiliate fee growth, and could we actually see a little upside to the 5% that you're guiding for 2014? I think previously you -- I think you commented that international would be roughly 10% of free cash flow or cash flow. Are there any updates to that number? Thanks.","Joseph NeCastro","Hi, Amy, this is Joe. We're obviously very helpful that we can't provide an upside to the affiliate fee revenue growth to international. What you see in that guidance is a reflection of what we expect for the current year. So the likelihood of that's going to move in a material way in this year is very small. I would love to be able to tell you that next year we think it's going to move up based on international. But we're just going to do this one market at a time. A lot of those deals are shorter terms. So, you do have swings at those agreements and those rates more frequently. But like here, it has to do with the success of the network and your commitment to new programming there. So, the game is the same, it's just smaller markets. And we do believe longer term will have a very positive effect on that line, but that's hard to know exactly when that would be.","Amy Yong - Macquarie","Thanks. And on cash flow?","Joseph NeCastro","Yes. On cash flow, we're committed to have its international business be a positive contributor and a significant portion of the business. I think we have targeted actually numbers higher than that internally over the longer term. But we do look at this sort of as a five-year horizon for us, but we're going to build and build and build and trying to create a significant business out of this. Cash flow although, I think their number could be north of that, if anything.","Amy Yong - Macquarie","Great, thank you.","Operator","Next, we have Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Thank you. Good morning. Joe, you honestly announced the big dividend increase and buyback authorization. You were out of the market in the fourth quarter, I just wanted to see if you could comment if that was the stock getting breaking out of the metrics, so to speak?","Joseph NeCastro","Okay. As you know, we've talked about some in the past. We look at their program, relative to all the other opportunities and everything else we have going on. And we have in the past from time to time decided to move it with the sidelines. We did that in the fourth quarter. I'd rather look forward. And as we just get through our Board meeting here, we're very bullish on the stock. And we're going to put more money to work.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Lori, the programming spending last year in cash was basically flattish. I know that was less than you had expected to spend. This will tie that into the OpEx growth in '13? I would have maybe guessed a slower pace of growth on the cost and given the cash than last year, and what are your expectations for cash on content in '14?","Lori Hickok","The cash is a little bit, I hate to use this word, lumpy in timing because our production cycles are six to nine months ahead of premiers. For a lot of times, it's just we might have programming that we've already spent it sitting there right to hit the air. The team did a great job managing expense, but we could see that rise in Q1. We're planning on investment being up next year, we're looking for growth there. Not another flat year is not what we're anticipating.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Got it. And then, I just want to come back on the content side last question. I feel like the performance against the Olympics is important and significantly positive. I'm wondering if you guys think, sort of greater time shifting and factoring into that and either time shifting Olympics, time shifting your content. Are you seeing this is for anyone, Ken or anyone else on the call, sort of an improvement in what's happening on the on-demand front? Is sort of feels like that's happening, but the numbers are all sort of obvious to us externally.","Kenneth Lowe","Look, I think it's a great question, that's one that we're taking a hard look at because we do see improvement in our performance this year versus Olympics in the past. I'm not trying to dodge the question. But I'd like to see it all in because I think some of the events it depends as you know how the Americans do. There is no question, the Americans do better, the ratings do better. When you have this much time shifting, it's really hard to say, I do think every year, digital is playing more and more of an impact in online results.","So, I think when it's all set and done, we'll all sit around and kind of add it up all up. But the encouraging thing for us, we've got something. As in really strong nights, I mean, this stubborn nights ratings-wise here and there which has been a little surprising to be quite honest with you, but existing really in the game where the opponent intended to got to size this up. I think when it's all set and done, the Americans have strong finishes, the hockey and all those events. At the end it could sway the numbers, but right now we're carrying very well. But there's no question, I mean, when you get this much time delay, online digital results that have an impact. There's no question. But I have to say, I think, again DC is doing a pretty good job overall.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Thanks a lot.","Kenneth Lowe","You got it.","Operator","Next we have David Bank with ARB Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","We could -- I guess it should be RBC or ARB, as long as you took my question. Thanks, guys. So, two questions. The first is you commented on sort of sequential improvement in scatter pricing. Can you talk a little bit about how you're seeing volumes kind of -- are they firming, do you kind of feel same as in the prior quarter on the scatter side? And I apologize if I missed this, we got a lot of ratings specificity around Travel, can you review, season to date kind of trying total day and most relevant demo for flagship Food and HG as well? I'm sorry, not season to date, quarter to date?","Kenneth Lowe","Yes. I'll tell you what, David. Let me -- ","Joseph NeCastro","Let me answer the first question.","Kenneth Lowe","All right, go ahead. That's a pretty encompassing question, but I'll give it a shot.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","Only if it is from ARB.","Joseph NeCastro","Maybe if you're from RBC -- ","Kenneth Lowe","We may not take your question, now that you've asked it. Let's go ahead.","Joseph NeCastro","So, look, on scatter volume I'd say the short answer there is that its firm, it's not growing dramatically, it's very steady. Our base is as you know, not an in and out sort of base. So I think we feel pretty good about where it is. So the growth is coming from pricing and constant to up slight volume.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","Great.","Kenneth Lowe","And David, let me take a stab at it. I think maybe the best way I can kind of summarize your question, if I may, is there is a lot of stacking going on, some shifting. We have introduced some new shows that we have a chance to see Guy's Grocery Games, the Cutthroat Kitchen with Alton Brown and we're stacking Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives now Monday through Friday, 11 and midnight strip. And that boosted the ratings in that one hour by 5%. The move to event programming, for example, on Monday night in January with Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-off; positive impact on the night.","I can summarize it by -- here is the headline. These moves in primetime, some other things that have paid off with first quarter ratings up so far 20% over fourth quarter of 2013. And time spent viewing, which is critically important to us, because we haven't engaged the audience and the longer we can keep them viewing, time spent viewing has an all-time highs. Its strongest results we've seen at the Network. And the other takeaway, huge improvements on weekend daytime, weekend daytime is up 15%, so far, in Q1 over fourth quarter of 2013 and 24% over last January. So we're seeing a lot of positive results. As you recall 2012 was just an off-the-charts year.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","Right.","Kenneth Lowe","So 2013 was a tough comp year, but to see these gains early in Q1 is very encouraging; obviously we got to keep it going. But the moves that broken heart team are making with Burton's assistance, I think are paying off. And the other good takeaway is we got a lot of good programming in the pipeline in our opinions will fresh up and serve some new talents. So all-in-all, feeling very good about Food.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, terrific.","Operator","Next question is from Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Two questions. First, on the international goodwill write-down, you mentioned that it had to do with some activity -- you'll be meeting some of your initial expectations. Can you be a little more specific on that? I'm just curious as to what you were looking for and what the drivers were, they did materialize and how that depression impacted your strategy internationally?","And then, second on repurchase and the potential for pace there, does that sort of lower relative flow, given how much of the shares are owned by the Scripps family members, did that impact your -- how you look at your ability, your pace there, is it possible to perhaps repurchase some shares? Thanks.","Joseph NeCastro","Sure Mike, this is Joe. I'll take both of those. So, write-down was related to affiliate agreements, more than anything and the timing of those; two things happen specifically. One is I think just the perils of acquisitions. You look at the forecast and then your evaluation of whole businesses is based on that. We were kind of that forecast was aggressive as a management forecast. We probably didn't discount right now, frankly.","Secondly, there were one or two real events where based on the transaction, one or two bad actors decided to, in our view, illegally pull their distribution from us in the hopes of renegotiating something. And that was something you couldn't anticipate.","But the third thing was we take a long view of these acquisitions. And we decided to invest more in the business plan. We probably initially have planned both in the programming side but also in the infrastructure side. All those things said, we love the business, we are committed to do it, it was the right thing for us to do. The accounting rules force you to consider the nearing years, most importantly in your valuation the DCF sort of evaluation. So, when you do that results and goodwill coming in underneath the evaluation on books where you take the write-down.","We don't -- it does not change our view going forward of how we're going to grow. It's a good functionality of our future acquisitions that have a lot of distribution agreements, and we certainly have learned from it, we will be fine. But like I said, it's good business and good management team and we are committed to it.","With respect to repurchase agreement, the family ownership does not affect our decisions, with respect to pacing. Say, be well passed this horizon where we start to worry about the flow frankly. I can't speak for the family, I have no idea whether or not help, they will participate, obviously, we would buy their shares. This is really as we would anybody else's. So, if they participate, that will obviously put off any concern that we would ever have on flow. But in this horizon, I think we can buy very aggressively and we will not have any concerns about what related to family owned shares.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities","All right. On the first point, the affiliate agreements, that sort of changed or recalled. Was that in the U.K. or can you help us with maybe generally what markets or what region that took place in?","Joseph NeCastro","Obviously in Eastern Europe.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Barry Lucas with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Barry Lucas - Gabelli","Thanks and good morning. I have two, if you could. First one, Ken, I think you spent a lot of time pulling out DIY maybe more so than I've heard in the past. And I'm just wondering does that maybe suggest that we could see expanded distribution and a bigger opportunity at DIY and how would you go about capitalizing on it?","Kenneth Lowe","Sure, Barry. Good morning. Look, DIY is just been on a role. There was an article I think last week in the Wall Street Journal talking about the reinvesting the American consumers doing and remodeling and fixing up. And that certainly I think have been reflected in DIYs ratings. We've had some nights with DIY with limited household distribution to 900,000, close to a million audience delivery in 25 54. For a network it's not exceeding 70 million households. I would love to have that household, that network in a 100 million households. The reality, Barry, we talked about this is it's tough for these midsize Tier networks to get to that kind of distribution, it doesn't mean we're not going to keep trying to grow it. But right now if you look at where caps are in household distribution and the ratings is throwing up, it's pretty phenomenal.","And additionally, obviously Barry, it gives us a chance to widen that remote in the home category. And also what we're seeing is some of the talent is being developed and coming up on DIY migrating to HGTV. So, just an overall success story. We'd invest and we're open to investing more to gain distribution, but it's a little bit of difficult slog with our distribution partners, and you get these Tier networks, these \"digital networks\" that have kind of been slotted in that second Tier.","Barry Lucas - Gabelli","Okay, thanks Ken. And let me just come back at the -- I'll try to come back on the expense growth issue, one last time. Joe, I think where you may have kind of parsed out what inning we are in at Travel and reinvestment and programming expansion there, the dollar amounts, let's say from 12 to 13 and 13 to 14 at the high-end on an absolute basis would be comparable, so what inning are we in Travel and does that mean that more the dollars are going into other areas and any other color you can provide there would be appreciated?","Joseph NeCastro","Sure. I'm not sure I'm going to give you all the color you want on that, but I think Travel is definitely in early innings. We think that when we bought it, again to the long view of it, if you look at the track record on HG and Food, they were not built in a couple of years, they took several years to get to the point where they are today obviously.","So, we remain optimistic about Travel. We will continue to invest there. Obviously we're hopeful that we can build hours there because that means your ratings are growing. So these success factors there are the same as the other networks. We'll continue to build programming as ratings grow and continue investing new things and new ideas, so we have that sort of full table of signature series and make that another \"must see\" network.","As far as the other networks, we do continue to invest there as well. That's a function of a (competitive) situation, the ratings, number of new ideas you see, but I mean over the long haul we're at a pretty significant level of investment in those other two networks. And we've done well, and I think the recent development show that's certainly home category have done terrifically well. It wouldn't hurt us to refresh programming once in a while in those categories, so we're going to need to do it.","I think the way Lori put it is exactly right, we're trying to take money out of things that don't affect consumers. They don't see on the screen, they don't feel the marketing and take everything else flat to down and make sure that where we spend the money is the most appropriate for our longer term success.","Barry Lucas - Gabelli","Great, thanks for that, Joe. I really appreciate the additional color. And Ken, thanks for reminding us about the sale of the cable systems to Comcast, because we do appreciate that Comcast stock.","Kenneth Lowe","It's my job, Barry. What can I say? Take care.","Barry Lucas - Gabelli","Thanks.","Operator","And our final question is from Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Please go ahead.","Matthew Harrigan - Wunderlich","Thank you. First of all, thank you for the opportunity to meet Vanilla Ice at the Consumer Electronics Show.","Kenneth Lowe","Hey listen, Matthew, you knocked out some good ratings.","Matthew Harrigan - Wunderlich","Great marketing for DIY. One of your executive, Lisa Owens was on an Advanced TV panel and she was fairly cynical on 4K TV at least for something like Food. It feels like there could be an opportunity there for Travel. Could you talk a little bit about that and also, what she is doing with uLive?","Joseph NeCastro","I don't know. Obviously I did not hear her remarks about 4K TV. We have not seen anything that will make us believe that it's a plus for us. I think you're right, if there is a network where it would make a difference, it would be Travel. I think we're a long ways off from seeing an effect on that as well.","With respect to uLive, I think we're delighted with the progress they've made with the market and the ad team plus them and in fact we have had great receptivity from our ad clients. We have some big initial sponsorship and we've got a lot of activity there and it's growing nicely. The challenge there is continuing that growth to invest appropriately and to structure it in a way that it benefits all of the categories and our current (franchises) to new uLive brand. So we're working on it, and we're very excited about the prospects there, but we still have some work to do.","Matthew Harrigan - Wunderlich","Thank you.","Kenneth Lowe","All right. Thanks, everybody, and Cathy, you can read the replay instructions and Mike will be available to take your follow-ups. So, thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay today at 12:15 p.m. Eastern Time to February 28 at midnight.

Actual results may differ from those predicted. And some of the factors that may cause results to differ are set forth in our publicly filed documents, including our Form 10-K.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Ken.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Thank you, as always, for joining us on the call. We're very pleased to have been able to announce healthy results for the quarter this morning, demonstrating our consistent ability to navigate a clear and steady course as consumer behavior and business models evolve.","This management team is wholly focused on driving revenues across multiple streams while maintaining tight control on cost. As you've seen in today's announcement, we're doing a very good job in that regard. Now, some key principles underpin our successful strategy and uniquely position this company to grow in a fast-moving media landscape.","First, in an environment where consumers have more options than ever, strong brands win. I cannot emphasize that enough. People look to the brands they know and trust to separate high-quality content from pure noise with consistent and compelling experiences across multiple platforms. Our brands drive deeper monetization by creating value for distribution partners looking to grow their customer base and reduce churn, and for advertisers who want to reach an upscale, high-quality audience.","At Scripps Networks Interactive, both HGTV and Food Network are powerhouse brands where we've built consistent environments that touch consumers' lives in multiple ways. Close to 200 million consumers interact with one of these brands every month. And that makes the networks, the websites and other consumer touch-points really must-haves in their categories.","Like both HGTV and Food Network, Travel Channel has huge brand recognition and potential. We're continuing to build that brand with millions of consumers who rely on Travel Channel for expertise and inspiration across all of our television and digital properties. And we're working to build our other brands, too. Cooking Channel, DIY Network and Great American Country are seeing greater brand loyalty than ever. These are brands that resonate with audiences everywhere, and we work tirelessly to optimize them and enhance them.","Now, the second key principle is that you have to be sharply focused on delivering the content that audiences love. And both HGTV and Food Network closed the quarter among the top 10 cable networks for adults and for women aged 25 to 54. And there are days, by the way, when they both appear in the top 5.","HGTV has now seen 14 consecutive months of year-on-year ratings growth and is up 10% over last year. While at Food Network, shows such as Food Network Star are delivering higher audiences than ever before. Cooking Channel has just scored its most watched month in network history; DIY Network, its highest rated second quarter ever; and Great American Country, well, its highest second rated quarter in five years.","This growth isn't limited just to television. We're seeing impressive digital growth as we roll out an enhanced short form strategy. Entries to our home giveaways are higher than ever. And we're building enhanced relationships with millennials on apps and third-party services.","The next key principle is there must be a clear path to modernization. When you have strong brands delivering compelling content across all platforms, that's a proposition that is vitally important to advertisers. Now, despite the press reports you may have read foretelling a tepid up-front, we're pleased with our recently completed negotiations as new and existing advertisers seek to reach the engaged upscale consumers that we consistently deliver. We recently put our advertising sales and distribution groups under common leadership, reflecting the interconnection among all types of revenue in this fast-paced environment. This enables us to examine and optimize all revenues streams.","Next, you have to be sure that you never rest on your laurels. Innovation lies at the core of how we operate at Scripps Networks Interactive. We're always looking for new ways to do business to gain a new understanding of our consumers or to develop and use new technology, and that includes pioneering new deals with emerging platforms such as Verizon's new mobile video service, investing in early-stage businesses in related spaces, such as Refinery29 or Tastemade, or taking a more robust view of technologies and capabilities that enhance our offerings to consumers.","Video delivery via television or digital services remains at the core of our business, and we believe it will be so for many years to come. However, it's important that we'd be agnostic about platforms and business models to ensure we grow our company for the long term as consumer behavior continues to evolve.","We excel when it comes to understanding audiences and delivering high-quality content that makes a deep connection, but we can't sit still. We have to innovate so that our lifestyle content remains vibrant and relevant to consumers of all ages, now and in the future.","Finally, we have to take what we've learned and apply it to new markets. Just last month, we acquired majority ownership of TVN, Poland's leading multi-platform media business. Now, this significantly expands our international reach and it gives us instant leadership positions in an important and growing market. Deals such as this give our company a platform to build our businesses in the region and increase international distribution of our existing portfolio of channels. Great content will always connect with an audience, regardless of geography. Our skill and experience in developing that content will be the key for us as we seek to grow our global businesses for the long term.","This has been a strong quarter for Scripps Networks Interactive, and the company is in great position. Consumers love our brands, and they love our content. We deliver clear value to our distribution and advertising partners, and we're building value for shareholders. That's the strategy we're delivering on.","Now, to take a look at the specifics of how we've done all that during the quarter, let me turn it over to Burton. Burton?","Burton Jablin - President, Scripps Networks","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. I want to bring you up to date on how our networks performed during the quarter and offer some insight into future programming that will keep us moving forward.","Strong ratings across the board propelled HGTV to its second best quarter ever, just behind the incredible record performance in the first quarter. HGTV finished the quarter ranked number two in women 25 to 54, and number seven among all cable networks in adults 25 to 54. Several of our hit series enjoyed their best ratings to date as Brother Vs. Brother, Flip or Flop, and House Hunters Renovation drew record audiences.","By the way, that 14-month ratings growth streak at HGTV includes last month, which was the highest rated July in network history as more than 45 million viewers tuned into HGTV primetime during the month. Kathleen Finch and her entire team are setting the stage for future growth with both new and returning series. Just a couple of weeks ago, we announced new seasons for several successful series: Vacation House for Free, Island Hunters, Living Big Sky, and Log Cabin Living. These fantasy destination programs are among HGTV's top-performing shows.","Not to be outdone, DIY Network hit new peaks during the quarter and delivered a record-breaking audience of 15 million total primetime viewers in May with top-performing shows, including Lake Life, Garage Gold and Building Alaska. And like HGTV, DIY Network recorded its best July ever.","Food Network had an improved quarter. As Ken mentioned, Food Network claimed a top-10 finish in both adults and women 25 to 54. Our key tent pole, Food Network Star, is wrapping up its 11th season this month with double-digit ratings improvement over last year and has consistently ranked among the top cable shows in the critical 9 PM Sunday time slot. Cutthroat Kitchen is going strong and we expect great things from Camp Cutthroat, a spinoff that premiers next week. Looking ahead, we have several new and returning series coming in the next few weeks, including premier episodes of Beat Bobby Flay, Great Food Truck Race and Guy's Grocery Games All-Stars.","Travel Channel ratings were down for the quarter, but there are some positive signs. Audience quality continues to improve. Median income increased for the ninth month in a row reaching almost $59,000, its highest level in four years; and people are watching longer. Time spent viewing rose about 5% for the quarter. A couple of new series performed well. Mysteries at the National Parks provided the good win. It's the second best-performing new program of the year so far. And viewers gave a thumbs up to Man Finds Food, which explores some quirky, off the beaten path food establishments.","Cooking Channel just celebrated its fifth anniversary and marked that milestone in June scoring double-digit increases in women and adults. It was also the fifth consecutive month of year-over-year gains. And July set another high mark as the highest rated month on record for women 25 to 54. Some of the top performing series included Unique Sweets, Tia Mowry at Home, and Dinner at Tiffani's. Lots of new cooking fare is on the way, including the new program Steak Out with Kix Brooks, featuring the Country Music Superstar. We'll also see new episodes of Man Fire Food, My Grandmother's Ravioli and Carnival Eats.","At Great American Country, adults 25 to 54 were up 15% through the end of June to the highest level in six years, driven by the success of Scripps' library content such as Flea Market Flip and Barnwood Builders. We continue to see improvement in audience composition as median income reached the second highest level in network history, just slightly behind the first quarter of 2015.","On the content distribution front, Ken mentioned our agreement with Verizon for the impending launch of its over-the-top platform. We really like this service because it delivers a dual revenue stream. We continue to seek additional opportunities to extend the reach of our lifestyle content. We remain committed to the TV Everywhere model. Scripps has been a leader in this area. We have agreements in place with virtually all of our distribution partners as we work to improve the consumer user experience. Last month, we rolled out live feeds of HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel on our own TV Everywhere apps, and our other networks will follow soon.","Before I close, let me talk a little bit more about what Ken said regarding international. I can't stress enough the significance of the TVN acquisition. This is a crucial step forward for Scripps Networks Interactive. TVN is a profitable, well-run company in a vibrant media market with significant growth potential.","TVN has an audience share of around 22% of the Polish market, as well as a significant ad sales business that also sells advertising for third-party broadcasters. With solid and experienced management, TVN is in a strong position to meet the evolving needs of consumers. The acquisition also provides us with an additional hub to build out our existing global networks in the region. Put simply, TVN is a key addition to our international portfolio and a great example of our strategic approach to international expansion.","In addition to TVN, we've carved out a significant presence and success in some important markets in just a few short years. For example, as of quarter's end, our international footprint extended into more than 175 countries reaching more than 150 million cumulative subscribers in 30 languages. HGTV was the number one lifestyle channel in Singapore just six months after its launch. Food Network is the UK's most watched lifestyle channel. Travel Channel Poland saw 15% audience growth in the key young adult demo. Fine Living has grown its audience 43% since its launch last year in Italy. And in Malaysia, Asian Food Channel and Food Network are among the top three networks for women 25 to 54. Audiences in so many countries love our lifestyle content just as they do here in the States. Our International team, led by Joe NeCastro and Jim Samples, is spanning the globe in search of new opportunities.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Lori to go over the numbers.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to discuss the financial highlights and the primary drivers for our results in the quarter. Then, I'll provide some comments on third quarter expectations and then open it up for Q&A.","Total company revenue was up 3% on advertising and affiliate fee growth. For expenses and segment profit, several items impacted the current and prior year quarters. In the current year second quarter, there were $5 million of restructuring expense and $4 million of cost related to the TVN acquisition. And in the second quarter of 2014, there was $10 million of expense related to the early termination of certain third-party service provider contracts. Total reported segment profit was up 12% during the quarter. This reflects the revenue growth coupled with lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of our restructuring. And excluding the unique items noted for both quarters, segment profit would still have increased about 12%.","Net income attributable to SNI was $1.49 per diluted share. The current year figure includes $0.21 per share gain from foreign currency contracts, $0.14 per share from the effects of foreign currency on TVN funds and $0.03 per share from restructuring expense and $0.02 per share related to the TVN transaction and integration cost. The prior year second quarter also reflects $0.07 related to the early termination of certain third-party service provider contracts. Excluding these items, our EPS would have been $1.47 compared with $1.14 in the prior year period.","Looking at key revenue drivers for the second quarter, advertising was up 1% and affiliate fees were up 9% compared with last year. Advertising revenue growth in the second quarter was driven by the 2014-2015 upfront market price increases, which were partially offset by soft scatter pricing and some audience delivery issues at Travel Channel and Food Network. Scatter versus scatter CPM pricing across the network was approximately flat year-over-year and up high single to low double-digits over the broadcast upfront.","As for advertising categories, our top five were food, retail, auto, home improvement, and financial. These are slightly different than prior periods with auto and home improvement moving up while CPG decreased a bit.","As Ken indicated, in the just completed upfront we once again finished strong with total volume up mid-single digits. This was driven by low to mid-single-digit increases in CPM pricing coupled with selling approximately half our inventory, or a little more than we did last year. Our success in the upfront speaks to the desirability of our lifestyle networks as valued programming and marketing environments with highly-engaged viewers who are passionate about food, home, and travel.","So far in the third quarter, the advertising market is fairly consistent with recent demand and pricing trends. Also, as our advertising partners look out into the rest of 2015, their tone is generally positive. Third quarter year-over-year scatter versus scatter pricing is roughly flat, and up high single to low double digits over the 2014-2015 broadcast upfront.","Affiliate revenue grew 9% in the second quarter driven by contractual escalators. The growth rate was also positively impacted by additional non-linear revenue that we recorded this quarter.","Looking at our network performance in the U.S., revenues were up 3%. Our advertising revenues were up 1%, impacted by the pricing environment and audience delivery. Affiliate fee revenues were up 9% on the items noted. Cost of services increased 2% due to the timing of show premiers, while SG&A expenses were down 10% reflecting the benefits of restructuring coupled with lower marketing and promotion expense. In total, Lifestyle media segment expenses were down 3% compared with the prior year; and this includes $2 million of restructuring expense.","Revenues at our international businesses increased 8% to $22 million in the second quarter consolidated results compared with the prior year. Contributing to this growth was our expanded footprint as we've launched in more countries over the past year and improved results in the countries where we've been operating.","In addition to our consolidated international operations, the largest share of international business is currently reported below-the-line in equity income. Our international partnerships in Canada and United Kingdom comprised approximately half of the equity earnings. In total, our equity in earnings of affiliates was $27 million, similar with the prior year.","Before I cover updated guidance for the full year and provide some comments on third quarter expectations, I wanted to touch on a few balance sheet items. First, we didn't repurchase any stock in the second quarter, but we still have $1.2 billion remaining under current board authorization; and under that authorization there is no time limit.","And we continue to view stock buybacks as an attractive use of capital. After the TVN acquisition, our gross leverage is 3.4 times. And assuming we are successful with the tender offer for the remaining TVN shares, we expect to end the third quarter at approximately 3.2 times EBITDA.","Our underlying guidance remains unchanged. That said, we have updated our previously issued full year guidance to reflect the expected impact of TVN. The updated guidance, and excluding the impact of one-time items, is as follows: total revenue is now expected to increase about 12% for the year; cost of services are now expected to increase about 24%; selling, general, and administrative expenses are now expected to increase about 5%; and interest expense is expected to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million, while non-controlling share of net income is expected to be between $180 million and $190 million.","Capital expenditures are expected to be $65 million to $70 million, and the company has reiterated its previously issued tax guidance of an effective rate of 30% to 32%. Additionally, once all purchase accounting adjustments are completed, the company expects to update its previously issued depreciation and amortization guidance. We expect this will be issued on our third quarter earnings call.","Now, due to the inherent seasonality in our business model which leads to the fluctuations of quarterly expectations, I'll provide some specific comments on the third quarter. We expect total revenue growth to be in the high teens. Advertising revenue growth is also expected to be in the high teens, while affiliate revenues are expected to increase in the low teens. For expenses, cost of services is expected to increase in the low 30%s; and we expect selling, general, and administrative expenses to be in the high teens. In total, for the third quarter, we expect consolidated expenses to be up in the mid 20%s compared with the prior year third quarter.","Additionally, beginning with the third quarter earnings release, we expect to provide additional disclosure for our international business. And with that, we are ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Go ahead, please.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much. I actually have a couple questions. The first, just related to TVN, because you gave some numbers. I think in the presentation you gave \u2013 was it March 16? The trailing leverage post-TVN close was supposed to be about 2.7 times and I think now you're mentioning 3.4 times. So is that just exchange rate differences on TVN EBITDA, or what does that suggest? And then, secondly, can you talk a little bit about the differential and the strategy between HGTV and what's going on with Food and Travel? I'm sure this might not be a record revenue differential, but the growth in HGTV is pretty impressive while Food and Travel, obviously both down, is a pretty wide differential. Can you talk about strategies to close that gap and bring up Food and Travel, please? Thanks.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Hi, Doug. It's Lori. I'll answer the leverage question. Really, the big driver between the number we provided when we announced the acquisition, now, is the tender offer. At the time, we were only anticipating to do the mandatory 56%. And now, we are tendering for 100%. So, assuming that that is successful \u2013 and there's some variation with cash and things at different parts of the quarter, too. So that's causing some volatility too. So, we have cash waiting to close certain transactions and do the tender.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","And then \u2013 so TVN EBITDA, sort of the budget for calendar 2015 is still about the same?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, it is.","Burton Jablin - President, Scripps Networks","And, Doug, this is Burton on the second question. It is true we're very pleased with the success at HGTV. When you analyze what's going on there, it really is that the team has been able to create show after show that is within a range of what people would expect from the HGTV brand; and, yet, they're all just a bit different. Also, they found great talent, like the couple we have on Fixer Upper from Waco, Texas and the Property Brothers and so many others, that really are able to connect with viewers.","A little bit of a different situation from Travel to Food Network. At Food Network, Food had a number of years where it was growing. Then, it got hit with what you would expect when you see a network growing; competition took a little bit of the air out of it. And so, now, we're in the process of sort of consolidating what we have there, finding some new talent. I'm really happy to say that in the second quarter we introduced handful of new shows, most of which \u2013 all but one, really, did very, very well, and we've got high hopes for those to come back as continuing series. It's just a matter of finding the talent, putting on the concepts that will work, and that's what we're doing.","At Travel, we really did plan this year to introduce pretty much an entire new slate of shows. And of that slate, I would say the track record is about half are working. That's kind of within our expectations. The bulk of those new shows, though, will come on beginning midway through the third quarter and toward the end of the fourth quarter. And I can tell you that we've got a combination of some new series, returning series that have already worked, like Expedition Unknown, Hotel Impossible, Booze Traveler. And so, we think the fourth quarter is where we will really see the strategy at Travel Channel come to fruition.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","I just want to make sure I capture \u2013 the commentary about sales and distribution or common leadership, does that lead to any \u2013 and optimizing all the revenue streams, does that lead to any step up in monetization at Food and Travel relative to HGTV?","Burton Jablin - President, Scripps Networks","I would say not necessarily. I mean, really the sales teams, overall, are doing a great job of leveraging the marketplace. I mean, scattered across the board, we're seeing record demand. It really is about the impressions delivery. And so, when we get our impressions delivery at Food and Travel where they need to be, we'll see that revenue realized.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Understood. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks a lot. I have one for Ken and one for Burton. Ken, you guys have the strategic investments in Tastemade and Refinery29. You mentioned that in your prepared remarks. Those are small, I understand, but they're growing so rapidly. So I just wonder what are the strategic learnings there in terms of the success that those two assets have had in terms of their distribution on YouTube, on Facebook, as compared to, say, to the Food Network? Has it taught you anything in terms of the success or \u2013 of different types of digital distribution?","And then, maybe somewhat relatedly, Burton, you mentioned that you'll be rolling out live content into the network apps, the watch apps. I just wanted to ask, what are the drivers of the decision to keep content inside of your network apps as opposed to that content being a part of the MVPD's apps like, for example, the Xfinity TV Go App? I wonder what, in terms of your decision making or negotiation with the distributors, leads to the decision or outcome of which live content goes into your network apps versus their apps? Thanks a lot.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Anthony, let me start with your first one as it relates to Refinery29, Tastemade, those types of investments and the learning. If you will, it's holistic in the sense that we're not only learning from Tastemade, Refinery29's other investments \u2013 and to your point, it's not huge investments we're making in these. We're certainly getting a seat at the table, a place on the board, if you will. But what we're finding in parallel to a lot of things that we're doing with our brands on digital platforms, that the way they may be targeting millennials, which is their primary audience, is a little bit different than how established brands like HGTV, Food, Travel, will target audiences on digital platforms as well. So it's a real learning experience. It's complementary. You will probably see more partnerships going forward, but you'll also see us competing, like we do with Snapchat, like we do on a lot of digital platforms. So we're watching. We're looking. We're learning. We think they're smart investments. You'll see us do more from time to time.","And I think as Burton maybe tackles the second part of this question, some of the learning that we're doing in some cases, not just in the investments we're making, but in other forms of content that's out there competing in our categories, is causing us to do things a little differently and more competitively than we would have with maybe traditional brands that have been around for 20 years. Is that fair, Burton?","Burton Jablin - President, Scripps Networks","I think that's right. I mean, if you take Snapchat, for example, we're building muscles in creating daily content. So some of the things that we're seeing our partners at Tastemade and Refinery29 do, we are adapting to our own digital products and services.","Speaking of which, on TV Everywhere \u2013 thank you for asking that, Anthony, because I need to clarify. The same content and the same live feeds that we put on our own apps are also available, depending on the agreement, but on almost all of the MVPD watch apps as well. That's by contract. It's also what we want. We want our content available either in the live feed form or in on-demand form for our top shows on all of the TV Everywhere watch apps, both our distribution partners and our own. So it's in both places.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Anthony.","Operator","Thank you, and we'll go next to John Janedis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Ken, you and Burton talked about new platforms. And since the beginning of the year, the mind share around the skinny bundles, obviously, increased a lot. You spoke to the Verizon new offering. On a practical level, are you seeing any impact on distribution or, longer term, do you think these platforms expand or shrink the industry? Thanks.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's a great question, John. Let me just answer from SNI's point of view, because it's very difficult to take kind of an industry viewpoint of these because it's going to change a lot depending on how many networks a particular company has, how successful they are. Are they able to travel across multiple platforms, because I think in the future that is more and more going to be necessary for brands?","But in our case, I'll repeat what we said in our opening comments. Strong brands win. If you look at all the announcements thus far \u2013 and I think we talked about this on the last quarterly call \u2013 that are being made around skinny bundles, there's the possibilities of things like Sling, et cetera. We're there. And the reason we're there is not just because our distribution partners know our content works and wins, but if you look at their promos, if you look at their commercials, they use us. They use the Food Network. They use HGTV as examples of quality content that they're trying to sell to consumers. To me, that's the best endorsement you could possibly have from our distribution partners.","So, regardless how big or small the bundle \u2013 and it is going to shrink. We know that. It's going to look in different forms and ways \u2013 be priced in different forms and ways. At the end of the day, strong brands that resonate with consumers, that have personalities that are trustworthy to the merchant that Burton mentioned, these are must haves. And in the world going forward, in my opinion, if you don't have those, then you're going to be in for a long day at the distribution table with some of our partners.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then, maybe one for Burton. You talked about the volume being up mid-singles in the upfront. Does that include digital money as well, or would that be incremental? And what is your projection for total upfront dollars across the industry? I'm just trying to get a better sense of maybe your market share gains.","Burton Jablin - President, Scripps Networks","Well, as far as the industry, you can read the various reports as we do. So, we'll leave others to sort of characterize the entire industry. In terms of digital, that's a little bit of a tough one to answer because so many of our deals include both a television and digital component, but there are some digital-only numbers as well. In general, the bulk of that, obviously, would be television.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, John.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Vasily Karasyov with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Vasily D. Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Burton, you made comments on Travel Channel saying that the demographic \u2013 the key demo composition is improving. And when I look at my Nielsen ratings spreadsheet, it looks like the network was down mid-teens. So, can you help us understand at what point the improvement...","Burton Jablin - President, Scripps Networks","Yes. What you're saying is true. When we started out this year to introduce new programming to Travel Channel, we had two aims; one, to increase the viewership within the core demo of 25-54, but there's an important qualification and that's upscale audiences. The potential at Travel Channel is not only to grow its overall impressions, but to grow its footprint, its share, its composition in upscale. Because that's the hallmark of how Food Network and HGTV and our other networks have really carved out a competitive advantage in the ad sales marketplace.","So, we're looking at that composition of higher median income as a very positive sign for what we've done with our programs. So, even though, overall, the audience levels have gone down a bit this year, we've made the audience more attractive to advertisers. Now, the goal is to take that improved audience quality and grow its numbers. And as I said, I think in the fourth quarter \u2013 actually, beginning halfway through this quarter and into the fourth quarter, we're introducing more shows and new episodes of already proven hits with that desirable upscale demo that I think are going to see that overall number come up as well.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That answer your question, Vasily?","Operator","Okay. He may have muted his phone. We'll move on to Michael Nathanson with Moffett. Go ahead, please.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. All right.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. Hi. One for Lori, and then one for, I guess, Ken and Burton. Lori, when you go back to your last quarter and the guidance you gave on costs, we thought they'd be up mid-single digits and they came in lower. Can you tell us what actually differed from what you thought it'd be in May, maybe what networks actually changed versus what you thought previously?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I would say, really, what the changes were was a shifting of some marketing and programs into the third quarter and fourth quarter. As you you've heard from Burton, we're going to do a lot of launching of new shows there. We like to match the marketing and promotion with that, so there was really some shifting of expenses there. Again, we reiterated our full year underlying guidance. So for the full year we still expect to come in about where we did it, so it was really just movement. And primarily \u2013 probably at all the brands, quite honestly, it would \u2013 I wouldn't say that there was any one particular one. We just continue to make decisions, do the right thing for the business and drive viewership.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then, for Ken or for Burton, now that you've unified distribution and ad sales led by Steve under one roof, how does he \u2013 or how do you weigh the benefits and costs of selling content to Netflix, which doesn't have advertising or affiliate fees, versus keeping those revenues \u2013 keeping those shows and pinning them to your typical monetization. So, how do you guys look at what's a very small amount of money from Netflix versus the opportunity to keep those shows on your own platforms or your MVPD platforms?","Burton Jablin - President, Scripps Networks","This is Burton. I'll take that one, because I was just with our ad sales and distribution folks last week talking about this very topic, a very hot topic; and it is the multi-million dollar question. I guess the way we look at it \u2013 and, of course, the Netflix deal is still relatively new, so we don't have enough data to make a judgment, but the way we would look at it is this way, if a \u2013 an SVOD deal, for example, reaches an audience of consumers that we're not going to be able to reach through our advertising supported distribution, our traditional distribution \u2013 so that may be the 10%, 12% of folks who don't have cable, or younger consumers who don't typically watch our linear networks \u2013 and we believe we're monetizing those folks through the SVoD license fees, then that's added income, because we're not going to be able to monetize them through advertising. So that's kind of how we think about it. And over time, we'll be looking at data from Netflix, for example, to determine whether we're doing that. And if we do, then that's a perfectly good way to make some money off of our shows with an audience that we otherwise would not necessarily get through the linear feeds.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Michael. If I could just add on, since you mentioned both mine and Burton's name in the question, I can't underscore the importance of what Burton's said enough, and that is in watching \u2013 what we're seeing in some of the research, there is an ability to do a certain percentage of viewing that's not cannibalizing our core viewing. And the best example I can give you is HGTV's ratings while all of this has been going on with the little bit of content that we put over on Netflix. It's not a great deal of content. And going forward, we'll question each and every one of those deals.","But in this environment we're in, and I can say maybe better than Burton, we want to exploit every possible avenue we have, because in owning the content, and you've heard me say this, Michael, we are our own rerun company. We are our own syndication company. So Les (39:40) might take \u2013 well, a syndication company might take Big Bang Theory to TBS; we may take one of our shows as our own syndication to a Netflix or wherever. So, we have to keep our options open, but at the end of the day, you're right, we're going to make more money on our own brands, generally, going forward for the next several years. So that's going to be where you'll see our emphasis.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thanks, Ken.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.","Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. It's Ryan Fiftal on for Ben. Two questions, if I may. First, on the affiliate side, with the 8% to 9% reported affiliate revenue growth, if you exclude licensing, did the distribution revenues accelerate or decelerate compared to 1Q?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I would just say it was \u2013 it definitely had an impact on the second quarter results. And if you look at the full year where we're saying it's more like mid-single digit, that's more in line with what you should expect going forward. So, it did have an impact. If you recall, we had one \u2013 it was the timing in SVOD deals, quite honestly, that gave us a little bit of a boost.","Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","So, I would look at the full-year guidance for more of a sense of what a realistic going forward rate is.","Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That helps. Then, I think if underlying was mid-singles, I think that means licensing came in a bit higher than we expected. We had assumed some Netflix deliverables. I don't know if that was the majority of it or if there was anything else that came in to the quarter.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","It was primarily Netflix that was driving the boost.","Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then, my other question on the advertising side, so you reiterated your underlying full year guide, and I believe that the full year guide previously assumed some modest ad rev acceleration in the back half. So I'm curious if you're still making a similar assumption and, now that we're through the upfront, now that you've launched some of your originals, if you feel like you have higher visibility into that or if it relies on assumptions that new content is going to work, or something along those lines?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","We continue to believe there will be acceleration, so that was always our thesis and point of view coming into this at the beginning of the year; and that still holds true. Really, one of the reasons why we reiterated our guidance that was underlying is that we continue to believe \u2013 and we are seeing the momentum, as Burton said. We're seeing some momentum on the Travel Channel. We're seeing improvements at Food, and this always was the plan. We knew it would take some time, and we're pretty bullish about the rest of this quarter and fourth quarter as we end the year and move into 2016.","Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Ryan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities. Go ahead, please.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. A couple questions on digital, and then one on costs. Ken, you mentioned being platform-agnostic, and I'm curious \u2013 you're seeing some of your peers launch their own direct-to-consumer initiatives. Can you talk about your thought process on your business, your brands being a viable direct-to-consumer business, and whether that's even structurally possible within your deals?","And secondly, what's your thought process on actually making a bigger investment in some of those businesses, like Tastemade, that were mentioned earlier in terms of expanding that digital footprint? And then, just on the cost, it seems that, based on the guidance, the cost growth will actually accelerate in the fourth quarter. I realize you're not giving 4Q guide, but just given we have the full year and the third quarter, is it your expectation that it accelerates and maybe what are some of the \u2013 what are the drivers there? Is it domestic, international? Why would it grow faster in 4Q? Thanks.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Michael. Well, look, for the foreseeable future, when we sit around the table and look at our strategic point of view, we really don't see anything short-term that tells us we're going to go outside of our traditional models. We \u2013 you heard me say earlier we fare very, very well with all our distribution partners. This is our bread and butter. Never say never, but short term, in the next few years, I just don't see it in the cards for us. It's still an aggregation business that we're seeing unless you have something like an HBO or Showtime and, quite frankly, we're not ready to make that move anytime soon.","And as far as investing more, yeah, we \u2013 let me \u2013 Joe has dialed in from Warsaw because he spends a lot of time looking at businesses like Tastemade, like Refinery29. Joe, you might want to jump in and take that question from Michael.","Joseph G. NeCastro - Chief Development Officer","Sure; happy to do that, Mike. The same things that were attractive to us about Tastemade and Refinery29 continue to interest us in other companies. We're extremely active; probably as active as anyone. We look at a number of deals. Say, as Ken mentioned before, the thing that really attracts us is the way that they approach video and approach the dialogue with consumer groups, especially millennials, and maybe more specifically millennial women. So we have our filters that we like to go through and run our traps, but we're very, very active. There's nothing keeping us from doing larger deals. I'm happy I'm in Warsaw because Lori is in Knoxville and she probably would kick me under the table there, but we're very active and looking for opportunities all the time.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. And then...","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Go ahead.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","You had a question on the cost.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Very reasonable deduction on your part that, yes, the fourth quarter will be higher as we have all of the new programming launching. So what you'll see is a heavier impact on the amortization side related to the programming, and then there could be some associated marketing to promote it.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks. Ken, I think, mentioned he was particularly enthusiastic about the Verizon OTT product because of the nature of its dual revenue stream, and I was wondering if you \u2013 maybe you could give a little bit more color on that. How much inventory will you own? How does the monetization work? Is it kind of Nielsen rated? Is it non-Nielsen rated? Who sells it?","And I guess in a related sense on the digital side, do you guys have any view of how the distribution on Sling is going at this point and kind of ballpark of how many subs you think you've picked up on that platform? Thanks.","Burton Jablin - President, Scripps Networks","Yeah. Hi, David. This is Burton. I actually said that.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Oh, I'm sorry, Burton.","Burton Jablin - President, Scripps Networks","That's okay.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great minds thinking alike, I'm assuming.","Burton Jablin - President, Scripps Networks","Yeah, I guess so; although, I'm very honored to have you confuse my voice with Ken's. You know what? We actually have said all we want to say about how that deal works. Just for competitive reasons we'll just leave that as it is, but we are pleased with the economics of that deal and we hope Verizon finds some customers for that to build it out.","And Sling, Ken, did you want to take that one?","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, really, David, there's nothing to add that you haven't already seen in the trade press that has come from Sling itself. We don't have any additional information as to the distribution numbers they've put out. The last I saw was a couple of hundred thousand, but there's really nothing I \u2013 we could add to that you already haven't seen in the public trades.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you. Two, if I may. The first one, just hoping maybe you can help us with the very frustrating sell-side exercise of trying to understand the progression of advertising revenue growth compared to audience delivery growth. I know that correlation is usually not as tight as we wish it was. But if I may just ask you, maybe we can learn something here. If you just compare Q1 to Q2, I think your ad \u2013 your network ad revenue grew close to zero. It's a small number, close to zero in Q1, and it grew 1% in Q2. In our Nielsen spreadsheet \u2013 I don't know about Jeff Heilies' (48:11), but in ours it looked like your audience deliveries improved significantly from Q1 to Q2, from like a negative 5% year-over-year in Q1 to something like flat in Q2 in aggregate, in primetime, adults 18 to 49. That might be the wrong demos that you look at, but anyway \u2013 we've got ad revenue growing by 100 bps and audiences growing by 500 bps in that analysis. And so that \u2013 but you said, pricing was rather flat. I don't know if there's anything either wrong with my numbers or anything you could help us learn from that. I have a very, very quick follow-up \u2013 I promise it's short \u2013 after that. Thanks.","Burton Jablin - President, Scripps Networks","Okay, Todd. Well, I'll try to take that. I'm not going to try to parse your numbers. Let's just stipulate that they're good. What I would say, though, is that there are variations in seasonality when it comes to advertising among the networks, and the networks actually behave differently from each other when it comes to seasonality.","So that has an impact, honestly, independent of what the impressions delivery is. There is also, as you yourself noted, the timing issue between when impressions pick up and when you can monetize those in the ratings. I would say this, though, as Lori alluded to, we expect to see sequential growth in ad revenue as the year goes on, and we also expect to see sequential growth in our impressions, overall. And so, hopefully we'll begin to see some tightening of that correlation.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Then, the one I promised to be quick, just would you share with us \u2013 for your fully distributed networks, anything you're willing to say on your sub count this year versus where it might have been, say, a year ago? Thanks.","Burton Jablin - President, Scripps Networks","I can take that one, too. Overall, you know as well as anybody for the industry that we're seeing overall sub counts down 1 percentage point to 2 percentage points each year for the last couple of years. So, we're not immune to that, as is anybody else in the industry. And that's just what we've been facing over the last couple of years. I think we did see a little bit of moderation in that decline in the most recent quarter, overall, for the industry. I don't know if that's a sign of things to come, but, overall, it's been in line with what the industry has experienced, except for increased distribution for DIY Network and Cooking Channel due to affiliation agreements that we concluded last year. So, those have actually grown.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from David Joyce with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI","Thank you. I was hoping you could update us on your international mix of advertising and affiliate fees. We've got some more clarity now on what you've got from TVN. And then, also, if we could get a sense of what your cost structure is internationally in U.S. dollars versus other major currencies. Thanks.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Joe, why don't you go ahead and jump in?","Joseph G. NeCastro - Chief Development Officer","Sure; happy to do that, David. I'd say \u2013 I'd start by saying that starting next quarter, we're going to provide more information and better clarity into the international operations once TVN becomes part of the results. I'd say once TVN does become part of the results, the balance of advertising versus affiliate will shift heavily toward advertising as it is a heavily advertising-weighted entity. In terms of \u2013 and again, probably have to defer to the next quarter to give you more granularity on that. I'd say the organic stuff \u2013 organic business prior to TVN was a better balance between advertising and affiliate; and, in fact, probably weighted more toward affiliate revenue there.","Cost basis will, again, be overwhelmingly based in Polish currency, in zloty and euro, because that's the primary currencies they do business in. Obviously, we have an exposure to British sterling as well and probably a variety of currencies in much smaller levels below that.","So, you'll see, obviously, a dramatic difference and heavily weighted toward our Polish business once we consolidate, starting in the third quarter.","David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI","Thank you. And also on the international front, is there any appetite to bring in the rest of the stakes of the UK or Canadian partnerships?","Joseph G. NeCastro - Chief Development Officer","Well, certainly, there's an appetite. We like both of those businesses. There are ownership limitations in Canada. There has been some movement on that front, but still nothing that is definitive. Businesses there have been very, very positive for us. Over a period of time we've growth a lot of value there. I think we own roughly \u2013 if you combine them all, roughly one-third of that business. And it's been a solid performer not just on the equity stakes, but also in our ability to sell programming into Canada. With respect to UK, we like that business very much. It's performed extremely well; continues to gain share. It is in a deadlock joint venture with BBC Worldwide, and we don't see anything changing in the near term; but we have made it very clear that we would love to own more of that if possible.","David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. My question's sort of a bigger picture and longer term question. You've done a lot of investments. You've a lot of moving pieces lately with the investment in TVN, the probable, I guess, increased stake buy-in of Travel. I think you have all your \u2013 a big chunk of your affiliate renewals domestically coming up shortly. I guess my question is, given all these moving pieces, where do you see the incremental growth opportunity really coming from over the next several years?","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Alexia. Let me take a stab at that. First and foremost, I just want to emphasize, and I think this quarter is a great example of it \u2013 I go back to something I said: strong brands win. That's not going to change anytime soon. So, our core TV business is going to be very good for a very long number of years, not just domestically, but globally.","And there was a question earlier about going directly to consumers with streaming content, getting outside of the typical partnerships that we've done forever with cable or satellite operators. We do see forming partnerships where, beyond our core programming content, we can create some incremental revenue.","For example, right now we partner with a lot of our advertisers in co-branded products. We have magazines with the Hearst Company. We see taking our brands, as we said, the consumer user experience, to wherever they are, whenever they want it. And to us, that's a pretty big open opportunity. How we get there, we haven't figured it all out, yet. Who we partner with, we haven't figured. But if you've watched us over the last few years, incrementally this is growing. And now that we're going global, and especially with the TVN acquisition, if you take just some of the promotions that we're doing, and I won't list them all off, we think those are opportunities in and of themselves to do digital content, to do short-form.","So incrementally, I think it's just adding on to the brands that we currently deliver and doing additional content and partnerships around the globe. And over time, the heft of that could turn from incremental to fairly significant. That's our hope and that's our plan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. And just a quick follow-up on the upfront, you did relatively, I think, better than a lot of your peers, volume up, pricing up. Could you \u2013 from your perspective, I guess, how, if at all, was the upfront this year different than last year? Are you seeing any incremental allocation decisions that are different or do you think it's relatively similar?","Burton Jablin - President, Scripps Networks","Well, this is Burton. I guess it's relatively similar. Some trends that began last year \u2013 we're seeing advertisers who want more flexibility. There is some shifting of dollars from broadcast upfront to calendar upfront, but the dynamics, I think, were pretty similar.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Alexia.","Operator","Thank you, and our final question will come from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. My question is on TVN. I know it has about a 22% audience share in 2014. Can you just lay out some of the programming synergies and perhaps what you think you can grow that share of viewership to?","And then, the second part of this question is I know that some of the programming mixes more toward general entertainment and news. How comfortable are you in migrating towards that type of programming? Thank you.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Amy. Joe, you want to jump in?","Joseph G. NeCastro - Chief Development Officer","Sure. Let me do that. Thanks for calling out the 22%. TVN is one of the \u2013 well, in our view, the premier broadcaster in the market. There are two other large ones that have big shares as well. And TVN, as you know, also launched a series of thematic channels, which has allowed them to maintain and, in fact, grow their share. They grew their share, again, this last quarter of their results. Mostly, we expect by the end of the year that we will be even more pronounced.","Our target is that that will continue to grow. They do have two lifestyle channels; one, called Style, which is primarily fashion and more traditional style. And they have one aimed at men, called Turbo. And they are \u2013 if you look at their programming mix, they like \u2013 as Ken has said or Burton has said, successful programming works around the globe. We're starting to see some of the formats that they use are in our content areas.","So, the teams are already working together to look at the formats and the library that we have available. And I would expect to start to see some of that programming in their schedule, I would say, as early as early next year. We do expect that will have a positive effect on \u2013 because we're just \u2013 we're proud of our programming. Obviously, we think it's very effective and will do well here. In fact, travel programming is doing well here already and some of the food programming is doing well here on other channels.","So, we do expect that that will inch up. It would be hard for me to say we have a specific prediction. Our acquisition case did not assume that that number would grow dramatically over time. It did assume that we would be able to use some of our programming here, however. I'm trying to remember, Amy, what was the second part of your question?","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","That pretty much sums it up. Thank you.","Joseph G. NeCastro - Chief Development Officer","Okay.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Joe, I think \u2013 Joe, she did ask are we comfortable in using \u2013 moving beyond just our...","Joseph G. NeCastro - Chief Development Officer","Oh, yeah. Yeah. Thank you.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...categories and into general entertainment.","Joseph G. NeCastro - Chief Development Officer","Yeah. Absolutely. Look, I'll tackle news first. Certainly, with respect to the news business, you know our company has in its DNA news, business. And we feel very comfortable. It's a very professionally run organization. I think the best news organization in the country here. And there is no reason to believe that that would change under our leadership. If anything, we will support them and invest behind it to make it even better, even stronger.","General entertainment, again, I think these guys do a great job. It is the more mature part of the business. I think the trick will be to balance the expansion of the thematic channels with potential sort of slow growth to even potentially leveling off of those more mature channels. It's happening across the market, just like it happened in the U.S. and other mature markets. So, managing that transition from sort of broadcast-only model to the sort of wider array of choices that you get is the challenge, and these guys have done a tremendous job of that. That said, we do continue to invest behind good formats and good general entertainment formats; very comfortable in those areas.","One way to look at that acquisition was that it did diversify our genre mix globally, and between what's happened \u2013 what we did in the UK and what we've done in Poland, I'd say we're sort of comfortable in multiple genres.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Joseph G. NeCastro - Chief Development Officer","Thanks, Amy.","Mark W. Kroeger - Chief Communications Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Thanks, everybody. This is Mark. Mike and I have made ourselves available for follow-ups for the balance of the day, and we'll talk to you then.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mr. Dylan Jones, Chief Communications Officer. Please go ahead.","Dylan Jones - Chief Communications Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, Louise. Good morning, everyone. On the call with us this morning is Ken Lowe, our Chairman, President and CEO; Burton Jablin, Chief Operating Officer ; Lori Hickok, Chief Financial Officer; and Joe NeCastro, Chief Development Officer.

Actual results may differ from those predicted. Some of the factors that may cause results to differ are set forth in our publicly filed documents, including our Form 10-K.","With that, I'll turn it over to Ken.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you, Dylan, and let me congratulate you. Our new Chief Communications Officer in your first earnings call. Good morning, everyone. Very happy you're joining us today to hear about our strong results from Scripps Networks Interactive. It was a great quarter. Our networks remain solid consistent performers and a strong financial results bear that out.","This is a company at the top of its game and growing its business for the long-term success. It's been a transformational year for our global business. This quarter marks the first time that we've included the financial results from TVN; and as you see, it's performing very well. This acquisition will forever change the face of our business worldwide.","TVN is a world-class operation with stellar management that has built the company that excels at connecting consumers with compelling content in multiple ways. Having successfully acquired 100% of TVN during the quarter, we're now making good progress integrating and aligning our operations. We're working with the team there to look at programming and formats and we're learning more about their production capability and how to leverage that as we continue to grow in Europe and elsewhere.","Creating compelling content is the essence of what we do. Because of the popularity of our content and because we own the rights to almost all of it, we're able to monetize it effectively regardless of how consumers choose to access it. That's an important point that differentiates Scripps Networks Interactive from many of our peers. The brand strength of our networks continues to attract decidedly upscale audiences.","Advertisers know they can reach engaged consumers with high disposable income. The people who have money to spend on the products and services that they could see presented on our networks. Let me give you just one example. The recent season premier of HGTV's hit show, Love It or List It, grew two million viewers with a medium household income of $92,000. That's considerably higher than the cable average. That's what we do. We're drawing high-quality, highly sought after audiences night-after-night.","During the quarter, Food Network and HGTV both finished in the top 10 cable networks on 36 nights. On five of those nights, they both finished in the top five. In the key female adult demo, both Food Network and HGTV made the top 10 on 56 nights during the quarter. Now that's consistency.","And we're doing a good job attracting the coveted millennial viewer. In the third quarter, Scripps was the only network group to post increases in adults 18 to 34. This age group is fast becoming an important segment of our 25 to 54 target. It's important that we make them aware of our brands as we lay the groundwork for future growth.","Our viewers overwhelmingly watch our programming live, which is a huge advantage for our advertisers. Our networks remain true to the brands we've established. Viewers know what to expect from us, and they get it night-after-night. That's why they keep coming back, and that's why they watch longer.","More than 190 million U.S. viewers tuned into one of our networks during the third quarter. That number represents 87% of all U.S. households, 87%. Strong brands, compelling content, consistent performance, upscale and engaged viewers. Nobody does it better than Scripps Networks Interactive. Audience know that, and our advertisers do, too.","Advertising sales during the quarter were strong. Ad sales have increased sequentially every quarter this year. We had a great upfront and a robust scatter market as we continue to deliver for our advertising partners.","In the most recent study by the research firm Advertiser Perceptions, which surveys key advertising executives across all sectors, both Food Network and HGTV were right at the top among all media companies, and that's not the first time. Our distribution partners recognize that the strength of our brands helps them create value, meet the needs of their customers and reduce subscriber churn.","Consumers responding to the most recent beta research cable subscriber study named Food Network number one among the networks important to their enjoyment of cable. HGTV was number one among upscale households in viewer satisfaction.","Of course, it's important that we continue to find new ways to connect with consumers. We remain strong proponents of the bundle, which is simply the most cost effective method for viewers to gain access to the best that television has to offer. We also strongly support our distributors' TV Everywhere initiatives, and we're seeing increased usage of those by the way.","At the same time, we continue to expand our horizons beyond traditional distribution platforms. We remain nimble and adaptive as we generate more on-demand and short-form content specific to the platform on which it's consumed. Our content partnerships with Snapchat and Apple News reflect our continued progress in this area.","So, in conclusion, we have powerful brands across the world. They're connecting deeply with consumers, and we're continuing to grow revenues as we monetize audiences on all platforms. The solid, consistent performance that our company exhibits quarter-after-quarter validates the efforts of our incredible teams around the world as we continue to build value for all of our shareholders. I want to thank you again for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive.","And at this point, let me hand it over to our newly named Chief Operating Officer, Burton Jablin, who'll give you some color on network performance. Burton?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","All right. Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. As Ken said, our networks delivered solid performance in the third quarter, a testament to the hard work of our network group, and the strong affinity millions of consumers form with our lifestyle content.","As many of you know, we've recently named Kathleen Finch, Chief Programming, Content & Brand Officer. Kathleen is a driving force behind the success of HGTV and DIY Network. Her expertise and experience will be vital across all of our networks going forward as we break down the silos that sometime separated our businesses and brands from one another.","I also want to recognize the contributions of Brooke Johnson, who is retiring after many years as President of our Food category. Brooke is, in large measure, responsible for guiding Food Network to its status as an iconic brand, as well as the incredible growth of Cooking Channel, and we thank her for that.","Now, for the past several quarters, we've crowed about the outstanding performance of HGTV, and we're going to do it again. HGTV ended the quarter as the number one cable network for women 25 to 54, which may be the biggest single ratings achievement we've ever seen here at Scripps. And for the 10th consecutive season, HGTV was number one among upscale women, the most important demo when it comes to the majority of household buying decisions.","This is a network built on consistent, strong performance night-after-night, with some of the longest viewing times in the industry. Several hits, including Fixer Upper, Brother vs. Brother, and Flip or Flop, scored big ratings wins and consistently delivered the most upscale audience in cable. That's what captivating content will do.","And while the third quarter was good, we have lots to look forward to in fourth quarter. All of HGTV's top personalities are back with new episodes, and we'll be ramping up promotion for the highly anticipated second season of Ellen's Design Challenge in January. So we're very pleased with the continued strong performance of HGTV.","Meanwhile, at Food Network, we're also seeing strong improvement in ratings. Viewers were more engaged than ever in the third quarter as time-spent viewing levels improved, thanks in part to a record season for Food Network Star and new shows like Camp Cutthroat.","Millennial ratings, specifically viewers in the 25 to 34 age range, were up 4% over 2014, outpacing growth of the 35 to 54 audience. Food Network Star, in particular, scored huge numbers, up 15% in adults 25 to 54, and 30% higher among millennials.","Fourth quarter is traditionally big for Food Network, and this year looks to be as strong as ever, as we roll out more premier programming in the fourth quarter than ever before. October ended on a high note with strong ratings growth in both women and adults 25 to 54. The late October finale of Halloween Wars posted strong adult ratings finishing number three in its timeslot. This helped drive Food Network's October viewership up about 10% over last year in adults' 25 to 54, and up 26% among millennials.","Over at Travel Channel, we continued to see audience quality improve. Media and household income reached $59,000 among the target demo, the highest third quarter level in four years. Time spent viewing was up 11%. As we've said previously, we expect to see ratings improvement in fourth quarter and beyond with new programming as well as the return of two series that performed well for us last year. Expedition Unknown was the highest-rated new series for Travel Channel in several years and has shown substantial growth, so far, in season two. And Booze Traveler brought the most upscale audience at any new series on the network and is back in fourth quarter.","DIY Network attained its most watched third quarter ever for both adults and women 25 to 54. Top-rated series Salvage Dawgs, Attic Gold, Rehab Addict and Yard Crashers attracted viewers in record numbers and vaulted DIY Network to its most watched primetime season among men, women and adults, 25 to 54. This was the fifth consecutive season of audience growth in primetime. So, a very strong quarter for DIY Network. And stronger still for Cooking Channel, which soared to the highest rated and most-watched quarter in its history.","Just listen to these numbers, adult 25 to 54, ratings up 23%. Women, up 24%. It's a younger audience with a median age of 47 and some of the top series brought in even younger viewers, Rev Run's Sunday Suppers, Dinner at Tiffani's, and Unwrapped 2.0 were millennial favorites. Cooking Channel reached all-time highs in primetime viewership, drawing more than 30 million total viewers, including tremendous growth on the younger end.","Finally, Great American Country continued its lifestyle evolution, recording its most-watched quarter ever, while sales combo ratings were the network's highest in six years. Now, Ken mentioned our strong support of TV Everywhere.","Recent independent studies suggest that viewing markedly increases in households that use TV Everywhere, and we are enthusiastic about the opportunity it provides us. We've recently updated all of our TV Everywhere watch apps and ramped up promotion of them. We're already seeing that pay off in higher-viewing levels, with year-over-year growth as high as 120%.","We're also participating in all the announced over-the-top services, including Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, and the recently launched go90 app from Verizon, among others, in addition to our ongoing SVOD deal with Netflix. This is consistent with our overarching goal to make certain our content reaches consumers in the place and at the time of their choice.","On the digital front, we're seeing strong audience growth as we focus on those digital products and services that drive revenue, support the evolution of Scripps Networks Interactive into the multi-platform world, and fulfill our goal to allow people to engage with our content anytime, anywhere, and on any device. Our digital audience has grown more than 40% year-to-date. We attract an average of 60 million unique visitors each month.","Now, turning to international, I can't say enough about the significance of TVN as a contributor to the bright future of Scripps Networks Interactive. We're already starting to take advantage of natural programming synergies. We recently announced our first major content agreement that will bring a Polish version of DIY Network's popular Kitchen Crashers to TVN Style next spring.","We're also working on rights arrangements for several U.S.-produced series to air on other TVN channels in coming months. As we said when we announced the TVN acquisition earlier this year, we see many opportunities to introduce lifestyle programming genres that have enjoyed success in other markets.","While TVN provided the biggest international boost, we also launched new services in several areas, including HGTV in Malaysia, Food Network in the Czech Republic, and coming next week, we will launch an over-the-air version of Food Network in Australia in partnership with SBS. Australia is a key priority for us, so stay tuned.","Our lifestyle content is just as popular around the world as it is here in the U.S. HGTV remains the number one lifestyle network in Singapore. Asian Food Channel is number one in Malaysia and Fine Living Network grew its adult ratings nearly 40% in Italy year-over-year. Travel Channel had its best quarter ever in the UK. So that's how we're meeting the challenges of today and growing the company for tomorrow.","Now, I'll pass the mic to Lori to review financial performance.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. Since you've seen our strong results, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers for the quarter, discuss our segment performance, provide updated guidance and then open it up for Q&A.","Regarding the segments, you probably noticed we have adjusted our segment reporting. We now have two segments, U.S. Networks segment is our old lifestyle media segment. So, our new international segment includes TVN and our legacy international businesses. Previously, the international operations were included with corporate and other.","Total company revenue was up 20% due to the consolidation of TVN, coupled with better-than-expected advertising and affiliate fee growth. Total reported segment profit increased 16%, driven by strong revenue growth partially offset by increases in support costs, primarily related to international investments. Also included were $11 million of restructuring and TVN acquisition-related expenses. Excluding these two items, segment profit would have increased 20%.","Net income attributable to SNI was $0.96 per diluted share. Excluding the restructuring, TVN transaction integration costs, as well as foreign currency effects on TVN funds, earnings per share would have been $1.06, up 14% compared with the prior-year third quarter. Revenue, segment profit and EPS were all better-than-expected due to stronger revenue and improved operating leverage related to our restructuring efforts.","Looking at our network performance in the U.S., revenues were up 6% driven by strong advertising growth of 5%, and affiliate fee growth of 6%. Contributing to advertising revenue growth in the third quarter were CPM price increases from the 2014, 2015 broadcast and calendar upfront, along with improved scatter pricing. Scatter versus scatter CPM pricing was up mid-single digit year-over-year and up low-double-digits over the broadcast upfront.","Our top five advertising categories during the quarter were food, retail, auto, consumer packaged goods and financial. These are fairly consistent with prior periods. This strong advertising market has continued into the fourth quarter with scatter versus scatter CPM pricing up high-single-digit year-over-year, and up low to high teens over the new broadcast upfront.","Moving to affiliate fees, contributing to the strong year-over-year growth were contractual rating (18:46) with our traditional distribution partners, incremental distribution increases that we negotiated for both DIY Network and Cooking Channel from recent renewals. And new distribution related to over-the-top providers like Sony, DISH and Verizon Wireless.","Ken and Burton spoke about how well the network is performing in terms of viewers and the growth in advertising and affiliate fee revenue really reinforces what they were talking about. These are big, powerful networks that viewers love and distributors want to carry. That's why we successfully generated strong advertising results as well as increased distribution for DIY Network and Cooking Channel. And that's why the over-the-top providers have launched these services carrying our network.","Excluding the restructuring expense recorded in the third quarter of 2015, segment profit increased 13% primarily due to advertising and affiliate fee revenues growth. Also contributing to the growth was the fact that overall expenses were about even with the prior-year, realizing the operational efficiencies from the restructuring efforts initiated in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our international revenues of $119 million increased significantly due to the consolidation of TVN, coupled with growth in our organic international businesses.","In local currency, TVN's revenues grew 6%, with advertising revenue increasing 7% compared with the third quarter of 2014. This increase was driven by thematic channel audience increases as well as pricing growth.","Our expanding footprint also contributed to international business growth as we've launched in more countries over the past year and experienced improved topline results in the countries where we've been operating.","International segment profit was a healthy $11 million compared with a loss of $6 million in the third quarter of 2014. This $17 million improvement is primarily due to TVN, as we are still investing in our organic international business. I'd also note that there is seasonality in TVN's results. Typically, third quarter margins are lower than the other quarters due to increased programming costs.","In addition to our consolidated results, we have significant international operations reported in our equity earnings. Our international partnership in Canada, the 50% interest in UK TV in the United Kingdom, and some new minority investments held by TVN comprised slightly more than half of our equity earnings. In total, our equity and earnings from affiliates was $23 million, which is up 33% compared with the prior-year.","Moving to the balance sheet. I want to touch on a couple of items. We didn't repurchase any stock in the third quarter. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we spent $2.8 billion and have reduced our share count by 29%. We have $1.2 billion remaining under our current board authorization.","Within our capital allocation priorities, we are focusing on using operating cash flow to fund organic growth, invest in M&A in the U.S. and internationally, and reducing our leverage. We ended the third quarter at approximately 3.3 times growth leverage. And finally, before we open it up for questions, let me update some of our full-year guidance.","As a result of our strong performance in the third quarter, coupled with advertising strength continuing into the fourth quarter, we now expect our revenue growth to be approximately 13%, up from our previously issued 12%.","Additionally, due to purchase accounting adjustments related to the TVN acquisition, we now expect depreciation and amortization to be $145 million. And finally, as a result of our 100% ownership of TVN, we now expect interest expense to be approximately $110 million for the year.","And with that, we're ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much, guys. I think one of the things that stood out in the call was the comment around breaking down the silos at the company. If you can give me a greater sense of what the opportunities are that you see as you sort of dig deeper into that? And I think also as a follow-up, you mentioned the growth as high as 120% off the TV Everywhere apps, can you just give us a sense of how big those watch apps and perhaps separately, digital, is as a percentage of your viewing at this point in time? That would be great. Thanks so much.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Hi, Doug. It's Burton. Happy to talk a little bit about breaking down silos. Obviously, always a good thing when you can do that and make it work. Our number one priority here is the health of our U.S. based networks, our brands, and that's still the number one priority. But, we believe that we have such creative ability across all of our networks here in the U.S. that to allow them to work with each other, allows for greater explosion of creativity than we see with people just focused on one network.","And so, we've seen that happen. Our home network categories have been combined for some years, HGTV, DIY Network, and we added GAC to that group, and I've just seen obviously great success at HGTV.","Kathleen Finch has worked, started a career here, actually, at Food Network, and has worked on all of our brands, basically, over the 16 years that she's been with the company. So she's in a great position to help lead this effort, and we expect to see a lot of good synergy as we work together to grow all of our brands.","And then on TV Everywhere, our percentages are off a relatively small base, because we, along with the rest of the industry, are beginning to really push TV Everywhere in a big way. But we find it very encouraging, and I have to tell you, the reason it's encouraging is because we have a very concerted promotion effort behind TV Everywhere.","So we look at how we promote it on our networks and what the reaction is in terms of downloads and watching with the apps, and we can see which versions of our promotions work better than others. So, obviously we're learning as we go, but we expect to see some nice growth there. It's one thing to download those apps. It's another thing to get people to watch, and we now promote that you can watch our programming on TV Everywhere apps virtually in all of our shows. So we're really hoping that this picks up even more as time goes on, and we're pretty optimistic about it.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Is one potential synergy that you start selling advertising across all the networks rather than just sort of in-group, so that sort of ratings volatility starts to net off sort of more seamlessly? Or is that not part of the plan?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Oh, our teams have sold across all the networks. While we have groups that focus on \u2013 advertising teams, I should say, that focus on individual groups, they're always looking to sell across networks, and for that matter to sell convergently with digital. So, there's always been great cooperation. We do expect there to be even more opportunity as Kathleen and her teams look to do programming initiatives that might involve all the networks at one time, for example, plus digital. So, yeah, we should see some more synergies there.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Vasily Karasyov from CLSA. Please go ahead.","Vasily D. Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I have two quick revenue questions. Can you please give us any additional color on the advertising revenue growth in the quarter, how clean is it? Was there any reclassification of digital revenue recognition?","And then on affiliate revenue, you call out the OTT players. I was wondering if you could tell us how sustainable that revenue stream is. Is there minimum guarantee? How contingent it is on those services getting subscribers and basically how sustainable it is going forward? Thank you.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","So, first on the advertising revenue, I think you might be referring to make-goods, but it was really the strength of the market that played in our topline performance. The pricing was very strong in the quarter, as we said in our prepared remarks, as well as just demand. So Steve and his team were able to sell it as fast as they were knocking on the door.","And also as we had projected, there was sequential lift. So we have been predicting all year that each quarter we would see strength and we continue to see that in the fourth quarter, that strength which bodes well as we turn the corner into 2016.","On the affiliate front, the sustainability, I think those are very sustainable. We don't talk about the particulars of each of those contracts and how we've arranged those. But we are seeing great demand for our products just looking at the views on all these different products. We hear great things, at least I'd say editorially, from our distributors and we're continuing to look at those audiences and wanting incrementally to add to our traditional distribution platform. So, again, we're seeing those brands and this audience that we aggregate working on these platforms as much as we've seen them work. Again, as Burton said, small numbers still today.","Vasily D. Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from John Janedis from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks. Maybe a bit of a follow-up and just on demand and modernization on the advertising side of the business. Meaning in the second quarter, the market was tight on the make-good front, but it was also hard to drive CPMs for networks that had inventory to sell, and that seems to have changed. So is it some new players that have historically haven't played in cable? Is it money coming back to TV or cable or a combination of factors?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","I would say it's predominantly money coming back to cable and the demand. I mean, I think they're finding it still a good platform in which to get your message across, and we're seeing that show up in third quarter. And again, we're continuing to get strength in the fourth quarter.","So, there's been a lot of talk about the move to digital, which we think there's still a piece and we'll participate in. I think getting your message on big platforms, the audience that we aggregate still moves the needle. And we may be experiencing more demand than others in the network cables, and our pricing had always historically been higher than the industry, but I think that's still holding true. And I think we outperformed probably price and demand even though the market is heating up across the board.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, Lori. Maybe on a related note, there's been a lot of talk about scatter pricing having the effect of pulling money forward into the calendar upfront, which you tend to be active in. So, I don't know if it's too early. But can you give us an update and to what extent that might give you more visibility into next year?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. This is Burton. We've traditionally performed well in the calendar market especially on the endemics with our home category. So this year, we are seeing the phenomenon that you're suggesting. As advertisers look at the scatter pricing increases, they're looking to buy into that calendar market. But at this point, we're not going to give any specifics, still some buying going on. But it's looking very good.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, Burton.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you very much. Question for Ken. There's been some talk or implication that other media companies are readying to go direct-to-consumer. Internationally, Discovery's got a direct-to-consumer offering. DisneyLife was launched in the UK in this quarter. Are you considering something similar with TVN, or does TVN already have a direct offering digitally?","And then, you guys have been pretty emphatic that you're unlikely to move outside of traditional models anytime soon inside the U.S.; but just wondering, if that strategy of building a direct-to-consumer infrastructure outside the U.S. could prepare you to go direct stateside if you wanted to in the future? Thanks. And I have a follow-up.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Anthony. Look, a very fair question. And, yeah, we're watching and hearing the same thing you are from our peer group, some of our competitors, some of the things they're doing. I'll let, Joe, specifically address some of the things that are going on in Poland right now with TVN, and then just overall some of our international strategy.","But let me say, again, and you've heard it throughout our comments, we're big believers of the current ecosystem and really supporting TV Everywhere. We're starting to see it get traction. We think long term, again, that partnership is the best possible platform for us. We really look at how we could deliver both on subscriber fees and advertising.","Well, advertising is a big component of what we do. The question to Lori earlier about over-delivery a little bit is because of the quality of the audience, the engagement and the fact that we bring advertisers a great solution. So, we don't want to give up on that just to look at subscriber revenue. And I think it's very early, early for networks like ours to start looking at over-the-top solutions.","Having said that, you've heard that we're participating along with a lot of our partners, our distribution partners, our traditional partners and some over-the-top initiatives; but the idea, again, is to keep it in the ecosystem.","Now, to your point, there is a little bit more experimentation going on outside the United States, I think, because it just depends on the maturity of the market and whether or not Netflix and some of the others are getting there. And Joe might give you a little light on \u2013 we think of it a little bit more aggressively on the international side. So, my answer that I gave you, Anthony, is primarily around domestic. But, Joe, do you want to talk about international a little bit?","Joseph G. NeCastro - Chief Development Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Ken. And thanks for the question, Anthony. One of the things we like very much about TVN was their willingness to be aggressive in development. And they moved from traditional broadcast model to thematics and then on to over-the-top products much earlier \u2013 much more aggressively than many players that we've seen in any markets. They have a product called TVN Player, which is a over-the-top product which has been growing very, very nicely. It does go direct-to-consumer, they also have mobile product.","They have allocated this year certain amount of programming for over-the-top only specific titles, and these are performing very, very well. They had a target this year of I think one billion streams for the entire year. They are well ahead of that pace, doing very well on their over-the-top player.","Some of the core titles in the market there as much as a third of the viewing comes from the player force again for select titles there, but again doing very, very well. We are actively considering over-the-top solutions in markets, where traditional entry is either difficult where the market is crowded or the regulatory concerns that would get in the way.","So, lots going on in that place. We do \u2013 obviously one of the benefits of the TVN acquisition is we thought we could learn from their experience in over-the-top and it would help inform any kind of that development in the states as well.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And just a follow-up for Burton. Just want to ask about the rating strength at HGTV, some folks out there would say a show like, Love It or List It, maybe it's formulaic or easy to replicate. But, as you guys said multiple times just now, your ratings are performing very well against a very tough cable TV backdrop. So, look, I know you have strong brands and creative ability, but is there something specific about the programming investment here at HGTV or something specific you can point to that you guys are doing in order to drive that performance? Thanks a lot.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. I'll try to answer, Anthony, without giving away any secrets, of course. It really is what we've always said, we have been absolutely consistent not just at HGTV, but at our other brands with staying on point. Our subject matter is home, HGTV doesn't waiver from that pretty much every second that you turn on the network you get a program that is within a very sort of tight set of parameters.","And I think that that while it isn't the way most television networks program, has created consistency that just gets viewers to come back night-after-night. And the proof of that, if you do look at the ratings, they really are pretty much consistent seven nights of the week, and that is an unusual thing in television. It's not unusual for our Scripps Networks in the U.S., but it is unusual in television. And that's led to HGTV's best year ever. We think things can continue to grow. But the secret is really just staying focused and delivering the same quality night-after-night.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Anthony.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. I have two for Ken and Burton. Ken and Burton, on the last call, I asked you guys about the strategy of selling to Netflix, and clearly, you have good reasons to do it. But since then, we've seen some of your cable network peers indicate a shift in their thinking, and you've always mentioned stacking and TV Everywhere.","So, I wonder, given it's 90 days later and things are pretty fluid, is there a rethinking of putting some of your older shows on, on Netflix, and maybe pushing more stuff to TV Everywhere? So, I want to see if you've joined the chorus of people who have kind of rethought some of the strategies.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Has it been 90 days, Michael, since we've talked?","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Yeah. It's like five years older for all of us.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Look, generally, no. I'll let Burton talk a little bit about the ongoing relationship we've had with Netflix. But the bottom line, at the risk of repeating myself, is it is a platform that doesn't allow us to take advantage of the dual revenue streams. And we're not sharing consumer information, at least to the degree that we think long-term we should.","So, I think whether it's Netflix, whether it's any of these over-the-top models, and back to John's question earlier, you never completely ruled it out, because I think we always \u2013 as we've said consistently through our script today, you have to go where consumers are, you have to be on the platforms they're on.","But now, Michael, our thinking really hasn't changed very much, because in owning our content, we really feel that we're better at monetizing it on the current platforms in the ecosystem that serves us very well. Having said that, we have a relationship with Netflix, but I would call it limited. Would you, Burton?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. It is. And what I would say, and I think I did say this last time in answering to the question, what we're looking at with Netflix is very specific. Are we able to monetize an audience that we otherwise are not able to monetize through our usual way of doing that to our traditional pay television partners, and we are getting evidence, it's still early. But it does appear that we're reaching an audience that otherwise really isn't watching some of these shows through paid television.","And then, the idea is maybe they're exposed to it, and they will become more frequent viewers. But the key for us is, are we monetizing a group of viewers who we otherwise wouldn't reach. And that's what we're going to look at with the Netflix relationship.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then can I ask one about advertising \u2013 just following-up on some of the questions before about the fourth quarter. We've heard this upfront, there are a lot of advertisers who may have cut back their inventory in the upfront. And we wanted to know, are they coming back into scatter? I know many of your clients want to be in the fourth quarter, so they'll probably use the upfront to get in the fourth quarter. But, do you have any examples of people who may have cut back more than they wanted to in the upfront, and now they're showing up back in the fourth quarter and have to pay more?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Well, I guess I'll take a stab at that. We had a strong upfront. So, I don't know that we saw that phenomenon, and I think part of it was third quarter scatter was a strong market, and so advertisers were probably saying, better get my money on the table in the upfront.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","And I would just reiterate that our demand for the upfront was very strong. So again, I think it's back to advertisers after last year, where they pulled back looking at their buying patterns, decided they really wanted to be on our platforms and our brands this year and put some money back into the upfront.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thanks, everyone.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Michael. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Julia Yue - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. This is Julia Yue, on for Alexia. Two questions. First, can you give us any more clarity on your thoughts around capital allocation in terms of your advertiser buyback, debt pay down, or additional M&A or investments, perhaps your investment preference for international markets compared to digital or anything else?","And my second question is, could you give us an update on your progress at Travel Channel? It looks like revenues were nearly flat this quarter after a few quarters with low to mid-single-digit declines. How much of this improvement was from better ratings from the new shows, higher CPMs from more upscale audience, better ad market, in general, or anything else? And how much room do you think there is for further improvement here?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","I'll start with your capital allocation question. Of course, we always think share buybacks are a good vehicle. But as we said on the prepared remarks, our focus right now really is on putting that money to work on organic growth as well as international and U.S. acquisitions. Again, I would say, we are opportunistically at both international and digital. Right now, the valuations are probably a little high on the digital, so harder to execute on that front.","And then, of course, we are de-levering to really give a firepower to look all of our options and how we return capital to shareholders as well as continue to invest organically and look for opportunistic acquisitions.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Alexia (sic) [Julia], on Travel, thank you for noting that. It really is a combination of the things that you said; pricing dynamics that we discussed earlier in the general marketplace, but also the mix of advertisers in that category, and the general improvement is certainly helping. As far as the future, we absolutely believe that there is growth at Travel Channel.","In fact, we've said on these calls that we're a little frustrated that it's taking a while, but we're in these things for the long haul. Food Network didn't become a success over night. HGTV didn't become a success over night. And we're building brands.","Just as we said in answer to the previous question, the goal at Travel Channel is to get a consistent slate of programming, create that expectation that is on brand and on subject. Night-after-night, we're beginning to get a collection of shows that are doing that, but we've got a ways to go. So, the answer is, yes, we absolutely believe there is growth potential at Travel Channel.","Julia Yue - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks so much.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Alexia (sic) [Julia].","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Joyce from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI","As we were to understand, TVN, the strategy there and the business model, how would you characterize the upside opportunity from the new programming that you're aiming to put in place there? What should that do for rate-lifting advertising levels or lifting the distribution revenue there? Thank you.","Joseph G. NeCastro - Chief Development Officer","Sure, David. This is Joe. Let me take that one. Look, we see multiple opportunities there for enhancing the programming offerings. TVN, as you know, has a slate of thematic channels, two of which are lifestyle channels. So, the first and probably closest in opportunity is to make our formats available to them, either to pick up as is or to produce locally; and in fact, I think Burton gave an example, something that we're already doing with the Kitchen Crashers there.","Secondly, we do have two of our brands in the market already both the Food Network and Travel Channel are in the market, we're looking for opportunities for home-related channel as well with our branding and more to come on all of that, but we see clear demand for our style of programming and great interest on the part of the TVN management and others in the market to distribute that. So, we think there's upside there in a market with dynamics of the Polish media market.","David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Amy Yong from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. I have a question on affiliate fee growth. Can you talk about the cadence of renewals over at HGTV and also Food? And is there an opportunity to take advantage of some of the rating strength that you're seeing at both of those network and perhaps pull forward some of the negotiations that you have? Thanks.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","It's always good to be in discussions when your ratings are high. But I don't know that that's part of the negotiating cadence. But I would say, we don't talk specifically about when individual contracts are up, but what I can remind you of is that we did the Food contracts back in 2008 and 2011. Those are coming off, so you'll start seeing those renewals happening in this current cycle as well as the HGTV, which were probably 10 years, they were a little bit ahead of that.","So, we are over the next call it, three years, very busy in our renewal cycle. And as you are probably aware, we said while one contract maybe up, sometimes other ones get thrown in the mix. So it's just a matter of what the affiliate and distributors need and what we are looking for. So I think more to come and we're into a new renewal cycle.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Morris from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. First question is on mobile. I guess my question is, have you seen, or do you expect to see, that the stronger position in upscale audience that you see in your linear networks, has that translated to mobile, do you think you have a larger scale of an upscale mobile audience or customer base?","And also, you've spoken about TV Everywhere, where are you with respect to your mobile relationship with customers outside of sort of traditional linear programming? Is that something you're investing in? Is that something that you see as a big opportunity? And then I have one on TVN.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Okay. Yeah. I can take a stab at that, Michael. With mobile, I would suggest that when it comes to the users who are already connected with our brands, we see the same profile. In fact, I mentioned 60 million total visitors a month to our sites, so about half of those visits are from mobile now. And so, you'd see demographics that are a little bit younger online, but in the same kind of upscale vein.","In terms of going after people in mobile outside, I think I've got your question right, outside of sort of the TV Everywhere and the ecosystem that we're in the midst of. Yeah, we are doing that. That's partly why we've entered into agreements with Snapchat, with Apple News; we've got a few others that we're creating content for Snapchat specifically, also Apple News, that is unique to those formats. And we will continue to do more of that. In fact, we are gearing our digital content teams, so they are more and more capable of creating either exclusive content or original content for distribution platforms that are outside of the traditional ecosystem.","And we think that we have an advantage there because, you have to remember, our content isn't like scripted entertainment content. There's a utility to it, especially on the Food side with recipes, that has great usefulness through mobile. And in fact, the recipe app, the In the Kitchen app is one of the most popular for getting recipes. So, we do think there's a lot of opportunity outside the ecosystem to reach people through mobile.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you for that. And then on TVN, do I understand correctly, you feel that some combination of the content and the leadership over there will also be beneficial outside of the local market, that you can use that to expand? And if that's the case, what's sort of the path to that expansion?","Joseph G. NeCastro - Chief Development Officer","Again, Mike, this is Joe. What we do think certainly longer term that has great potential. That was obviously part of the justification for acquiring such a significant presence in one market there is that they are \u2013 that's the most important market in Central Europe. We expect to be able to use it as a platform to expand elsewhere.","I think we're going to start with our own networks and our own distribution there, have that team manage it and hope to expand the portfolio there, but also look to neighboring market as it makes sense. And we could do it obviously a number of ways either launches or maybe some smaller acquisitions in the region as well. But we are looking for opportunities to take advantage of that management team that we acquired as part of the deal.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Would love to talk about program content investment with whoever feels like chatting about that. Listen, I know you're right in the thick of budgeting and I know you can't talk any specifics about 2016, and I don't want to try and put you in that position.","But maybe you'd be willing \u2013 if we just thought about \u2013 if you kept the number of original scripted hours kind of constant, which I think you're kind of up to run rate at most of your big networks, and you executed on the brand strategy that you've talked about, which does, I think, still have some transformation going, would you be willing to characterize sort of the natural inflation rate of what that would produce in terms of P&L reported content expense?","And then second sort of philosophically or attitudinally, if you think about the uncertainty in the world and going into 2016, are you more inclined to sort of ramp it up and push that and try and gain share and drive your brands and drive that topline higher and then adjust if you have to? Or are you more inclined to sort of pull back and then wait to pour on later if you see things coming? Any sort of attitudinally budgeting philosophy you have, I think it would be very helpful as we try and build models for 2016. Thank you.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Okay, Todd. Let me try to answer that. Well, I think your first part of your question, if I understood it correctly, is if we assume status quo, what kind of pricing increases will we expect? And I would say low-single-digit increases on similar appetite in hours across the brand. But certainly, we are looking to grow share, but we're being fiscally responsible at the same time that we do that.","And we also think with Kathleen being put in charge of all of the brands that we will be able to reap some synergies and probably some efficiencies in how we use our content across those brands here in the U.S. and, quite honestly over time, between the U. S. and our international operation.","So, we think there's opportunity there that we have not yet identified. But certainly, I think you've heard us say that we do not manage to margins. The most important thing we do is the product we put on the screen in front of the consumers, so we will invest wisely there and prudently, but we think there's opportunities to get more bang out of the bucks for spending today, and we will make a decision on whether we need to ramp that, obviously, as we look at the competitive landscape around us.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Lori. And I don't want to be \u2013 and so, I'll let you go. But if I can \u2013 so when you talk about low-single-digit price increases, just to be clear, and so that's just like-for-like, same-hour, sort of same-shows inflation. But then I think I also heard you say that there's probably some other stuff going on. In other words, low-single digit \u2013 you may end up spending more than low-single-digit increases, I guess, is what I'm trying to make sure I heard you say sort of. Thanks.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. That is exactly what you heard. You're just seeing these price increases. We have synergies and opportunities with Kathleen at the helm. But we're also looking at the mix of our products and what we're doing holistically across that. So, as you said so eloquently in your remarks, is it too early for us to call, but we are working with Kathleen and the brand to determine what that investment look like for next year. So, stay tuned for our next earnings call.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah. Okay. So, it would be opposite of eloquence actually, but I'll let you go. Thanks, Lori. Bye.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Todd.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Bank from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you. Ken, Lori, Burton, anybody, feel free to jump in here. When you listen to this discussion and you look at the numbers domestically, you guys just seem to be out-executing many of your peers kind of materially. So, let's assume that you're just pretty good at this, at a time when multiples across the sector have really compressed.","And I guess my question is, if you see this as a sustainable trend, that isn't just kind of a blip and you're not just lucky here, does it argue for you to be more acquisitive and to spread whatever is in the drinking water there across a bigger platform, or is it really demo and platform-specific? And does that speak to like expanding more in demo and similar demo and platform, because you're clearly doing something right? Thanks.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Look, David. We'd love to have more people drink our Kool-Aid. But seriously, it's a great question because if you go back to just a couple of questions earlier, I think the whole connection between this engaged affluent audience that we've tapped into and consistently done it year-after-year-after-year, has led we think, to outsized advertising growth and buying decisions. So, if you now start looking at the mobile applications of that same group, you're going to find, there are going to be a higher percentage of buyers and doers.","We've always said the closer we can get to consumer to the cash register ring, the better business we'll have. So, I don't think there's anything here that is particularly unique other than the fact that we have great people who execute very well, and we picked some pretty sizeable categories. And we've kind of worked the plan.","If you look at TVN, speaking of acquisitions, we take the similarities there. Joe mentioned a lot of synergy, but one of the big ones is data sharing. They do the same thing. They own content. They're able to engage the audience. We now look to your point of what we're doing on a very much a global basis. And this goes back to the earlier question too of, I think Alexia's (sic) [Julia's] question about capital allocation. The demand we're seeing for our brands right now on a global basis is really strong. And that allows us to think in terms of, okay, we now can duplicate, have a very good chance of duplicating what we've done here domestically on a global basis, adding then data, adding then mobile and content ownership, and it gets to be a pretty exciting dynamic.","So, it's a great question, but we never I think get away from the fact that Burton said this earlier, we stay on brand. It's so easy in this day and age to get off brand. And I think more importantly, as we're moving to other platforms, the quality of the brand to a question earlier, is why people keep coming back to sample our shows. They come for the brand. They stay because there's brand fulfillment.","So, it's kind of a holistic look at the categories we're in and then we see the opportunity to move on these other platforms and continue this engagement with an audience that to me as long as we don't surprise them, as long as we fulfill their needs and their expectations, I think we have a better than average chance of succeeding on other platforms and on a global basis.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have a couple. I wanted to ask about a segment you report that doesn't get asked a lot about, but the digital business, which I think was 25% of the revenue growth in that segment. Can you just remind us what's in there, whether it's advertising, affiliate and how you sell that business, so we can understand sort of the advertiser demand and sort of the strategy there? It's small, but actually had a huge quarter and is a pretty big piece of the growth, and then I have one follow-up. Thanks.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","So, included in that number \u2013 it's really pulling out both the advertising and the incremental affiliate fees that we're getting from over-the-top providers such as Sony, Sling and et cetera. So you'll see that. But the big quarter was really done, because of the key strategy that Steve and his team put in place last year which was a combination of programmatic, which is basically more of a remnant film, allows you to take advantage of swings in your inventory, combined, more importantly, with a focus on high-end sales, basically looking for $1 million-plus deals.","And also taking advantage of our convergent opportunities with our other products and platforms which I think, again, comes back to why we continue to outperform the market in many cases is that we're in these categories. We have these strong brands. And when you package them together on our digital advertising, along with our traditional pay TV products. We're doing great. So, again, I think it's really our strategy and the infrastructure we put in place starting to hit its stride.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And Lori, what inventory is that on? Is that on TV Everywhere inventory, or your home pages or all of the above?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","It's primarily our web and mobile products, is what you're seeing there, the videos that we put on our websites and on the mobile apps, as well as the ulive, where we do the distributed networks. So, it's a combination of that. It really is not our TV Everywhere. We would report right now TV Everywhere, which is really small numbers today, with our traditional advertising.","I'm sure they're over time. I really am a believer that this will all get aggregated. We're selling packages together, it's all advertising coming from platforms. So we're still living through this that we've bifurcated, but we really do sell it holistically.","Kenneth W. Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Ben, if I could just add, I think the other thing that we've talked about and we'll continue to talk about on these calls or sometime to come is how credible the research is that we're now seeing and the measurement that we hope to see in the future from a lot of these digital platforms and a lot of our efforts. As that gets better, I think this is an area you're going to see us continue to improve on and have outsized growth quarter-to-quarter as well.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, Ken. And just a quick housekeeping one.

Internationally, I think you were talking about looking at (59:25) as a way for broader international distribution. Obviously makes a lot of sense. Are you seeing the M&A environment \u2013 if you were to look at to do more traditional-type of M&A deals abroad, are you seeing the market either very tough from a valuation perspective, or are you seeing the markets tough from the operational fundamentals? Just trying to see, sort of line those two up, if you will?","Joseph G. NeCastro - Chief Development Officer","Ben, I'll take a swing at that. This is Joe.","Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Joe.","Joseph G. NeCastro - Chief Development Officer","It really is a mixed bag. I think the number one driver on international M&A is just the scarcity of really quality assets. And that was one of the things that really struck us about TVN, is that it's very rare to find an opportunity like that in a market as good as Poland. So, we are ever diligent. We certainly look for opportunities everywhere. Sometimes valuations, if it's quality asset valuations, can be challenging, unless there is good justification. But generally, it's more of the scarcity of quality assets out there.","Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's great, Joe. Thanks again.","Joseph G. NeCastro - Chief Development Officer","Okay. Thank you, Ben.","Dylan Jones - Chief Communications Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, everybody.

Our prepared remarks should take about 20 minutes, then we'll open it up for questions.

Actual results may differ from those predicted, and some of the factors that may cause results to differ are set forth in our publicly filed documents, including our Form 10-K. ","And with that, I'll turn it over to Ken.","Kenneth W. Lowe","All right, Mark, thank you, and good morning, all. As always, we really appreciate your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. We just completed a terrific quarter. Double-digit growth in advertising revenue, double-digit growth in affiliate fee revenue, double-digit growth in advertising sales on our interactive platforms and double-digit growth in earnings from our key partnerships and the list goes on. All driven by the remarkable power of our lifestyle brands to engage consumers in the deeply meaningful content categories of home, food and travel. Fans incorporate our brands literally into their daily lives, we influence the foods they eat, the homes they live in and the places they travel to, and we're reaching those media consumers around the world by the millions across multiple platforms, television, via the Internet, mobile apps and our successful magazines. That high level of engagement is rare for television networks and that's why our brands are must buys for advertisers and must carries for our distribution partners.","Our brands are really ubiquitous, authoritative and consumers rely on us for valuable information and inspiration. We're all about lifestyle, it's what we do, and based on our consistently strong operating results, I'd say we do it pretty well. ","Our investment in quality, original programming and our commitment to stay on brand is clearly delivering a return and creating value for our shareholders. We've introduced more new series, specials and episodes of breakout hits across all of our networks and the results have been outstanding. Let's review how we're performing by content category, starting with food.","We just delivered the highest rated quarter in Food Network's history with prime time viewing, among adults 25-54, up a very solid 13%. Food ranked ninth among all ad-supported cable networks in the demo and better yet, it ranked fifth for attracting women viewers in the same age group. ","Fan favorites like Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives, Chopped, Iron Chef America, Restaurant: Impossible, proved their enduring popularity and some of our newer shows performed equally as well, if not better. We got off to a very good start in January with the success of Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off, followed by the third successful season of Worst Cooks in America, and we think we found another breakout hit with Restaurant Stakeout featuring New York Restaurateur Willie Degel.","Now Willie's no-nonsense and a bit unorthodox approach to fixing troubled restaurants is really proving to make some good and fascinating television. Trust me, he is no wallflower, but it's a great show, I hope you get a chance to check it out. Restaurant Stakeout.","The second quarter at Food Network promises to be just as a strong as the first. In fact, we finished our best April ever. We're already having great success with Chopped All-Stars on Sunday nights and in just a few weeks, Food Network Star returns, this time with a surprising new twist, you'll have to tune in to find out what it is. All are powerful programming franchises that stand up very well in the face of some pretty intense competition.","Now while the TV network is breaking records, it's worth noting that Food Network Magazine is hitting new heights as well. The magazine's advertising based rose to 1.6 million copies during the first quarter, making it the top-ranked culinary title for newsstand sales and the sixth ranked magazine overall. That's pretty remarkable and a powerful testimony to the marketing power of the Food Network brand.","Also in the Food category, Cooking Channel was setting records of its own with adult 25 to 54 viewership up 23%, making it the highest-rated quarter for the network since its rebranding and launch, just a couple of years ago. ","Two new shows, Not My Mama's Meals with Bobby Deen, that's Paula Deen's son, by the way, and Symon's Suppers with Michael Symon, helped drive the audience numbers at Cooking Channel during the period. ","Now at HGTV, House Hunters, House Hunters International and Holmes Inspection are proving their durability as fan favorites, plus some of our newer shows like Love It Or List It, Million Dollar Rooms and Property Brothers, are really gaining traction. HDTV finished the first quarter very strong with its best-rated March ever in prime time viewership. HGTV ranked 15th in the adult 25-54 demo for the 3-month period, and the top 10 among women 25-54. ","As for upscale women viewers, HGTV continues to rank #1. HGTV is a remarkably stable network that maintains an excellent competitive position relative to its peers, and we plan to build on that strength with some new shows including Celebrities at Home, White Room Challenge, Design Star and My Yard Goes Disney, by the way, it will also return during the second quarter, so a really good programming slate at HGTV. ","And by the way, not to be outdone, HGTV's magazine is proving to be an early success with an advertising base of about 500,000 copies. We, along with our partners at Hearst Publishing, have greenlighted 3 more issues for 2012. Other promising HGTV brand extensions include the successful debut this spring of the HGTV HOME plant collection and a licensing partnership with Bassett for the HGTV HOME furniture collection. The furniture line will be available in about 400 retail outlets around Labor Day.","At DIY Network, our other television network in the Home category, we really had a great quarter. Prime time audience grew by 24% year-over-year, thanks to the popularity of The Vanilla Ice Project and the new Bronson Pinchot Project, just to name a couple of our standout shows. Lots of positive momentum in the Home category, and very encouraging.","On our Travel Channel, Andrew Zimmern's Bizarre Foods America, and Ghost Adventures continue to carry the freight during the first quarter, building momentum for the return of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations. As you know, we're working to redefine the network and the travel and lifestyle genre for television. ","We know from our experience at Food Network and HGTV, that finding 1 or 2 significant series or discovering another iconic personality, really make all the difference. What we're striving to create is a clearly defined foundation for the brand, a cohesive voice for the network and in the process, aggregate a highly targeted audience. Does that sound familiar? Well, it should, because it's right out of our Scripps playbook. So we've intensified our efforts to create original travel programming that's really engaging and uniquely all our own. Now one approach is to try formats that are working in our other categories, and that's really the idea behind Hotel Impossible, which premiered April 16. It's been performing well. Baggage Battles is another show that we have high hopes for, it's a great premise, if you ever wonder what happens to lost or unclaimed airline luggage, well, check it out, the show premiered April 11, so far so good. Audience response to the show has been very positive.","GAC rounds out our portfolio of television networks, the news here is that we've been under a bit of construction as we work to define a country living lifestyle format and wean ourselves away from the all music video format. ","On interactive platforms, our lifestyle digital businesses continue to flourish, averaging nearly 26 million unique visitors and 440 million page views a month. And our food and home websites are among the top sites in their respective genres based on the tremendous amount of traffic that each generates.","Food Network's In The Kitchen app, and Travel Channel's Layover app, by the way, have been the top paid downloads in the food and travel categories on the iTunes Store. ","And we continue to engage fans on popular social networks. On Facebook, HGTV and Food Network each have more than 2 million Likes and Food Network has more than 1 million followers on Twitter. Suffice it to say, that consumers and advertisers are well aware of the reach, popularity and utility of our digital platforms.","Internationally, well we're prudently building our businesses one logical, deliberate and measured step at a time. This week, we completed our acquisition of Travel Channel's international cousin, making us the globe's leading creator of travel programming and content for television and interactive platforms. Travel Channel International is a perfect fit, distributing content in 20 languages and 91 countries across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific. Our plan is to build on the powerful Travel Channel brand that we now own and manage across the globe. Our strong first quarter results also reflect the positive momentum created by our UKTV partnership, which increased its market share by about 7% during the first quarter compared with the same period last year. Looking ahead, we're discussing some interesting opportunities with our partners to add value to UKTV's home and food category networks.","So overall, I'd say that things are going pretty well for Scripps Networks Interactive and its shareholders. Nearly all of the key trends and measures are moving in the right direction and it looks like 2012 will be another positive year.","Now I'm going to turn the call over to Joe, who'll go over our financial results. Joe?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Thanks, Ken, good morning, everyone. I'm going to touch on some of the first quarter highlights and provide some color on what drove our positive results, then we can open it up for Q&A.","Starting with our consolidated view. Total revenue was up 11% on strong advertising and affiliate fee revenue growth. Total segment profit was up 5%, which reflects the expected higher programming costs, international spending and startup costs related to the digital growth initiatives we previously mentioned.","As a result, for the first quarter, income from continuing operations attributable to SNI grew about 24% to $0.73 a share. Earnings per share were positively affected by the 5.5 million shares of stock we repurchased during the first quarter at a cost of around $250 million. Over the past 9 months, we've repurchased 16.8 million shares of stock for $750 million. ","Looking at the key revenue drivers for the quarter, we finished with a stronger-than-expected advertising sales, up 10% versus last year. We also had better-than-expected affiliate fee revenues, which were up about 16% compared with the first quarter last year. Our networks benefited from the strength of the ad marketplace, with first quarter scatter versus scatter pricing up in the high single digits year-over-year, and up high teens to mid-20s over the broadcast upfront. Both of these were a little stronger than we anticipated at the beginning of the year.","As for advertising categories, our top 5 were food, consumer packaged goods, financial, retail and auto. In the second quarter of 2012, the advertising market continues to show signs of strength, although a little cooler than what we realized in the first quarter of 2012.","Scatter versus scatter pricing is running in the mid-single digits and scatter to 2011 broadcast is up in the midteens to low 20s. And the general tone among advertisers continues to be quite positive. ","We've also started the next upfront process with presentations in 8 cities around the country. While it's too early to know what the CPM increases will be, I can say we've seen increased interest in the presentations from the advertising community. This year, we've set attendance records at almost every upfront presentation. In fact, in New York City, we had more than 1,000 agency reps in attendance, up from around 800 the year before. So based on all these current trends, we're pretty optimistic about advertising in 2012.","Turning to the distribution side of our business. Affiliate fee revenue grew about 16% in the first quarter, increase is attributable to the renewal of about 25% of Food Network's distribution base at the end of 2011. With this renewal, 100% of the network's distribution is now on the improved rate structure we established at the end of 2009. Scheduled rate increases in the distribution agreements for all of our networks also contributed to the growth in the first quarter.","Now let's take a look at our Domestic Operating Segment, Lifestyle Media. Revenues there were up 12% on the strong advertising and affiliate fee growth I mentioned earlier. Total segment costs were up about 15% during the quarter, segment profit was up 8% from the prior year period. Driving the segment costs, program amortization was up about 23%. We continue to expect amortization cost growth to be in a similar range for the balance of the first half of 2012 with the second half expense growth running at a much lower rate, in the mid-single digits.","Non-programming expenses increased 10%, compared with the prior-year first quarter. This growth was partly attributable to employee costs as we have increased headcount to support our new business initiatives. ","Moving to our international initiatives, Ken mentioned the big highlight, our purchase of Travel Channel International. This will be wholly-owned, so their future activities will be consolidated into our operating results. Like our other consolidated international operations, results will be reported within the corporate revenue and expense lines on the income statement. Also, while we haven't provided any deal metrics, I can say Travel Channel International is expected to be EBITDA positive in 2012, but it will be immaterial to the total. In the first quarter of 2012, we generated about $6.6 million of international revenue that was included in our consolidated results. We also generated about $14 million of equity in earnings of affiliates and a little over half of that was from our international partnerships.","Also related to our international operations, we generated $7 million of foreign exchange gains and interest income from our note with UKTV partnership, both of which are recorded as miscellaneous income on the P&L.","While these figures affect different parts of the P&L in total, our international operations and partnerships are generating a growing amount of income for us. As I indicated earlier, during the first quarter, we repurchased 5.5 million shares of our own stock for about $250 million. And as of the end of the quarter, we had $250 million remaining under our -- the current authorization. We ended the first quarter with $646 million in cash, including $203 million we generated from continuing operating activities in the quarter.","And finally, today, the company is reaffirming its previously issued full year guidance. And with that, we are ready to turn it over for questions. Moderator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente, Barclays Capital.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have one for Joe, and one for Ken. Joe, it -- compared to our model, your affiliate fee growth in the quarter came in higher than we thought. Just wondering if you could talk about the sustainability of affiliate fee growth as we work through the year and even maybe remind us about the pace of your -- or the timing of your affiliate renewals as we look into 2013. And then for Ken -- go ahead, and then I'll follow-up.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Okay, Anthony, I'm going to ask Lori to handle the question on the specifics of the first quarter renewals but the second quarter, or the balance of the year, we have the same modest renewal calendar. We have some coming up, some smaller ones coming up, at the end of 2012, very light for, I guess, for Travel Channel. And we don't have much activity then until the end of '13 and some in '14.","Lori A. Hickok","Yes, and what's going on in the first quarter, really, I guess the good news is, is we made some assumptions on the universe and what would happen as far as erosion on the sub, so we really had more subs than anticipated in our plan, so that's why we did a little better than we're anticipating.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, for Ken, this question might be a little bit out there, but last night, YouTube had this huge presentation in New York and as part of it and as part of YouTube's branded channel effort, they talked about pledging $200 million of marketing against all those new channels and we were looking at the list of channels that they have, their branded channels and you've got one geared towards home, one geared towards food, one geared towards moms and so, there's -- there are folks out there that kind of say that this is a genre where, because it's a little bit lower cost in nature, the barriers to entry might be perhaps lower, it's not the high cost of sports programming, for example, so I just wondered if you could comment on the competitive landscape and how you think about your brands in the context of online and digital and new entrants like YouTube, thanks.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Sure, Anthony. Fair question. The competition for us in our category is obviously nothing new, we've been experiencing that almost since we launched HGTV and acquired Food, because if you go up and down the cable dial currently, there's quite a bit of competitive programming, and I think that just underscores the popularity of not only these categories, but how the popularity has grown and expanded, you just heard in my remarks that Food had the absolute best first quarter in the history of that network facing all this new competition. And so first and foremost, it's the competition from major programmers that are already out there in these categories. And I think the digital expansion, which is happening, and YouTube is a good example, is going to continue, because people go where the money is, they go where the eyeballs are, and there's no better audience than women, upscale women, women who are highly educated and it's where we do very well. We look at YouTube somewhat even with that kind of money and marketing power behind it as somewhat as another opportunity for us to see talent develop, maybe we can pluck some talent off of those channels. So I don't think, you've always heard me say, that the fragmentation will never stop, competition will never stop, so we're prepared for it. And the last thing I would just say that, we're currently on YouTube with an HGTV and Food Channel, and we're probably going to be working with them to develop even more channels. So to us, it's just another platform, another opportunity. But again, I'll just underscore the success we're having, even with all the competition we're experiencing. And by the way, we're getting competition on the broadcast networks now. So our goal is to continue to be the leader, is to continue to put quality programming up, and we'll just be ever mindful of the opportunities that the digital platforms provide us.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson, Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The -- just a couple of questions.  The first quarter was on a pace that suggests guidance could prove conservative this year. I'm just curious, the areas of uncertainty or the key dynamics that you would need to see before you'd be comfortable getting more aggressive with guidance? And separately, the buyback was a pretty healthy number this quarter. Any indications that you can give investors as to what kind of pace we should expect going forward? Thanks.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Sure, Doug, it's Joe. Look, I think the first -- you're right to point out the math on the first quarter pacing. I'd say, if we were at the end of the second quarter or maybe in the middle of the summer, we might feel better about how the upfronts have actually played out. So I think until we see the whites of their eyes, if you will, we're going to sort of hold where we are on guidance. Secondly, on the buyback. Yes, we have been working at a reasonably good pace there. It wouldn't surprise you to know that, that's a topic that we will be reviewing with the board at the upcoming meeting to determine sort of how quickly to continue to go there and what the next steps will be. So nothing to announce today or even shed any light on, other than to say, you see what we've done so far, and we will be addressing it going ahead.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If I could sneak one more, and I think on the last call, you indicated that seasonally, the 2Q advertising growth looked stronger than 1Q, and now you've put up obviously a pretty healthy number for 1Q. Can you shed any light as to whether that seasonality would boost 2Q above 1Q's rates still?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes. I think, you can tell from my comments in the script, we probably, we did outperform in the first quarter relative to our expectations. I would love to believe that, that would mean we will pull up the second quarter, but I think it's too early to say and I think what we're -- our sense is that we'll at least be on a similar pace for the quarter. But it's far too early for us to take a more positive view yet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani, JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. First, I'm following up on your comments on the affiliate fees. I guess given where subs came out in the quarter, is there some volatility there, or should we expect the affiliate revenue growth sort of be at the same run rate for the rest of the year? And then the second question is, just really on Travel, which was surprisingly strong in terms of revenues in the quarter, given the ratings challenges, anything else going on there?","Lori A. Hickok","Alexia, on your first question, there's a couple of things. Yes, I think you can imagine, we were very conservative in our sub estimation so as long that stays in line, there might be a little bit pickup there, but also there was some consolidation in the industry and unfortunately for us, the consolidation goes from a higher-paying sub-affiliate to one that pays lower rates. So you're not going to see the same sort of rates, so it's going to be a little lumpy and probably decelerate. But again, I think stay tuned to what's going on as there's been lots of articles on what's the universe look like, and where things are migrating.","John F. Lansing","Good morning Alexia, this is John. On Travel, we're very pleased with the progression of the programming strategy there and we saw a sequential improvement in ratings going into the first quarter and each month of the quarter. And in addition, our performance against relative to our audience estimates improved and that helped the drive the revenue in the quarter. In addition, the, just the pricing on Travel, overall, our pricing has been in the first quarter, in the high singles, Travel was the strongest of all of our major brands in terms of pricing, year-over-year, scatter versus scatter. And then, finally, DR, was really an improved story from a year ago. A year ago, DR on Travel represented 27% of the inventory and this first quarter, represented only 13% of the inventory, which is really, normalizes it and puts it in the same place, if you will, as HGTV and Food Network. So those 3 major dynamics really, pushed mostly by the improved programming and ratings really help drive that successful number.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And that shift in DR to other advertisers should continue to be a bit of a tailwind for you for the next couple of quarters as well, shouldn't it?","John F. Lansing","Yes, it should.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler, MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","You've taken a path of rather than doing Netflix, Amazon type deals, you've talked about doing deals with your cable and satellite partners. Just wanted to see if you can give us an update there, where you stand with that business. And then also, just a cash flow statement question for you. When I look at your, the dividends paid to minority interests, it was about $48 million there, much higher than what we normally see in a quarter. Anything unusual there to Tribune or something new?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Okay. John, you want to?","John F. Lansing","Sure, I'll tackle the first question. We are actively in the market right now, discussing opportunities with third-party distributors on the digital side. It really represents a third of our three-prong digital strategy, the first prong obviously is to work closely with our incumbent distributors to develop a digital strategy that helps strengthen the ecosystem of the current business model. And then we also, as you may know, we have a current direct-to-consumer digital business of our own. That is $100 million business today and it's being driven largely by video views on our websites and we just believe there's an opportunity for us to expand the existing direct-to-consumer digital business. And then thirdly, really take advantage of these third-party opportunities and we're out exploring those as we speak.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Eric, this is Joe. With respect to the distributions in the first quarter, the first quarter payment is the clean-up for the year, typically we pay out, based on a formula as we go. And in this case, there are 3 or 4 effects in that first quarter. One was that we had a very strong year in Food, so that residual is going to be bigger than the prior year. But also, it now includes the Cooking Channel and thirdly, we also had payouts to our partner, sorry, on the Travel Channel.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Morris, Davenport.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Two questions, my first one's on the advertising trends. Clearly, you came in ahead of where it seemed you were guiding, you gave full year high single-digit guidance, you thought the first quarter would be below it. As recently as kind of the end of February, you spoke to that. So did things accelerate in March and that's what took you above that level? And I mean your comments are again cautious, I guess just kind of cutting to the chase, I'm trying to figure out if you guys are being extra cautious again in your comments going into the second quarter? Or sort of what happened to get you above that level that you were guiding to in the first quarter? And then I have a follow-up.","John F. Lansing","Yes, this is John. I'll take that. It's a -- the first quarter was driven by 2 major factors. We had better-than-expected ratings, particularly on Food Network and HGTV. So we were over-delivering and the marketplace itself in the first quarter was strong with high-single-digit growth, scatter to scatter. We also put more inventory last summer into the upfront, so we're benefiting from that as well. The second quarter, the pricing is really just a tick below, if it's not high single, it's mid-to-high singles right now, and so that's giving us just some slight cautionary tone. The ratings continue to be strong, the marketplace overall is good, the representation of, as I said earlier, about Travel of DR has been lessened and replaced by more of the upfront inventory that we put in last summer and that's helping give us some wind in our sails. So all in all, we've over-delivered on the first quarter based on variables, some we control, some we didn't control. The variables we control in the second quarter continue to be good, and we feel good about those and the ones we don't control, i.e., the market pricing, we're just keeping a close eye on.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","So March trends didn't necessarily see an acceleration from what you were seeing in January and February?","John F. Lansing","No, I wouldn't say March, I would pull out March as a single story in the quarter, it was really a full quarter story.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, on your international investments, this is a bigger picture question, but can you remind us or update us, why are you focused on acquiring these networks internationally as a strategy for the expansion versus maybe licensing the content that you develop in the U.S., if it does have global appeal to networks that are already on the ground, have footprints in place? Thanks.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Sure. Mike, we have been licensing content globally for many, many years. It is not a very big business, in fact, it's a relatively small business, and we found that we were essentially putting other operators in business in our categories in other markets, and that we would retain 0 equity value, there'd be no long-term value creation for our shareholders. So that's sort of what the genesis of the international strategy in general. The fact that we've done a number of transactions that, some of which are acquisitions, some of which are JVs, is an indication that we want to own a fair amount of the upside wherever we go, and certainly, the value of our content should be reflected in the value of those investments over time. I think you just happened to see a quarter where we did an acquisition, we are probably a lot more active looking at JVs where we own a either a majority or even in some cases, a minority position and our contribution is programming. So there is a marriage of our programming and distribution out there that makes a lot of sense, and those are the types of relationships we're pursuing.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","When you think historically about the fact that you said that the licensing of the content has been rather limited, has that been your decision that people have been coming to you, but you've been cautious on how much you've let out? Or has it, can you give me a little color on that dynamic?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Well, I think it's fair to say, we've gotten a lot better at understanding what programming works and we likely could have grown that business a little bit more aggressively, probably in the last couple of years than we have, because we've chosen to try and own some of it. But I think, the easiest way to answer that is to say we were relatively cautious about the amount of programming we would license and we didn't have the most organized effort, we had many parties involved. So I think we've gotten better at that, but with a deliberate intention of limiting the amount of programming that we do license and holding back enough that we can build the channels business alongside of it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alan Gould, Evercore Partners.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Given the success in your ratings, I was wondering if this is changing at all your view as to how much you're going to invest in programming this year? I noticed in the first quarter, your program payments were pretty high, 166 versus 115 a year ago. Are you still targeting that mid-teens type of growth rate?","John F. Lansing","Yes, this is John, Alan. We are still projecting where we were in programming, it's a little heavier in the first half of the year, we were particularly focused on the second quarter and as the year progresses, it will moderate and our forecast on programming is where we put it before.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Should we see program payments and amortization of program assets start matching up or truing up by the end of the year?","Joseph G. NeCastro","They will certainly moderate, I'm not sure if it'll match exactly, but you'll see a reduction in the program payments of both in the prior year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Janedis, UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you give us an update on the rollout about the CityEats offering, and then the timing up for the potential for that self-distributed content platform you talked about?","Joseph G. NeCastro","I'll talk about the CityEats just very briefly, you probably saw an article in the Journal where they're starting to highlight that as a way we might use the value of our Food Network brand and maybe even Cooking Channel brand to give us an advantage in new product development. I'd say it's still very early to talk about the longer-term view of CityEats, we are launched in 2 cities now and working on a third, hoping to be much more aggressive in rollout going forward. But I think it's probably too early to talk about any specific results from that. We talked about the investment in that business being part of our results for the year, that's going to continue. If we get a sense that we're getting better traction, that may accelerate some, if not, it may, we may moderate some. But I think right now, we like where we are, we like the early results, we're committed to continue to build and hopefully, you'll see a much stronger push on that. And John, you want to talk about the video?","John F. Lansing","Yes, sure so, as you know today, we're pushing out a significant amount of video through our own websites. And we're working most closely with our incumbent distributors to create something that is mutually beneficial in terms of digital video delivery and then as we expand the opportunity on our own sites, we're working out a variety of strategies there to look to create a multiplier, if you will, in terms of the number of impressions we can create, and the timing of that is really, it's a rolling operational project.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And would that be sometime mid-year, do you think, or is it open-ended for 2012?","John F. Lansing","I wouldn't think of it as an event, so much as just as a rolling strategy to develop and create a mechanism for driving more video impressions online.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson, Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have one for John, and then I'll ask Lori to follow up on my affiliate fee question. Hey, John, you guys always give great data on scatter pricing. If you look at your slides from the last conference call, you had a conference [ph], you were saying that first quarter scatter was up mid-single digits and then, clearly, on this call, you're saying that first quarter scatter versus scatter was up high single digits. So, it would seem that March pricing got better, was that a function of just having more Food ratings to sell, is that why your implied pricing was better in March versus kind of what you guys thought back, maybe, last time you updated the market?","John F. Lansing","Yes, it's -- you're really talking about a couple of points in terms of 5% and 6% turning into 7% and 8% growth, and now we're seeing it come back a little bit closer to 5% and 6%. So we -- I think, I wouldn't read that much into the difference between high single, low single, we're not talking about 9%s and 4%s, we're really just talking about the midrange from 5% to 8%.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then Lori, just thinking about the new affiliate fee deals, on 25% of your sub base. Is it fair to assume that the rates you got for Food are consistent with rates that are already in the marketplace? So we should we think about, maybe the organic step-up from those deals kind of, we have a parameter based on the deals you did previously, or did you guys get above market rates for Food relative to you we were previously?","Lori A. Hickok","No, they were basically  based on the market, the rate card was set with the other deal, to be honest, so it's what you've seen previously as a guideline.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. So then, can you help us with how much of -- you say it could be a bit lumpy this quarter or this year, of the 16% growth, how much do you think is kind of one-offs that we should just not model the rest of the way?","Lori A. Hickok","I think, when -- by saying lumpy, what you have to watch, it's really more of a function of 2 things. One, we can't predict what's going to happen with the universe and the subs and so you'll see things moving in to telcos and out of the cables and the satellite companies and vice versa, so that does have an impact because they pay different rates depending on size. The other thing is we know, and you've probably seen like Insight and others that have been acquired, I figure MSOs have an impact on what they pay in the modeling. So I always talk a little bit of fun [ph] with small numbers, because $0.5 million or $500,000 makes a big difference in your percentage quarter to quarter.","Mark W. Kroeger","Everyone, this is Mark, in the interest of time, and to respect everybody's time, if we could limit it to one question and maybe one follow up, we'd really appreciate it. ","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Mogil, Stifel, Nicolaus.","Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And just one question for me. I'm just following up on, I guess, Michael and Alexia's question on the sub numbers. Are you seeing, overall, the sub numbers stabilizing or being better than you expected just at SNI? Or when you talk to your MSO partners, are you seeing the whole MSO universe across the board be more stable than originally they thought, even a couple of quarters ago?","John F. Lansing","Yes, Ben, this is John. I can take that. Actually, the story is good. It's over the entire universe, the complete multichannel universe. We see a gain, again, this month of 130,000 subs and that's the third monthly increase in a row, and that's the first time that we've had 3 months of universe growth, albeit small, in a row since December 2010, December to February, 2011, so over the past year, so that's good. And then, we're outperforming that on a limited basis, particularly with our digital networks. So we're over-indexing that small, stabilized universe as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I will follow Mark's instructions and ask one question and then one follow up. So since you put these Nielsen numbers in the release, I guess we have to ask about them, because it's interesting, you're obviously talking about strong trends in subscribers, but the numbers were down year-on-year. I would say so far, on the cable satellite side of those that have reported, the numbers have actually been a little lighter. We had Comcast yesterday and Time Warner Cable last week. So should we just ignore these Nielsen numbers, or is there just more noise here, or are you seeing an improvement from -- it sounded like that 130,000 number was actually April.","Lori A. Hickok","Well, what I would say is there's 2 different numbers, right? Nielsen represents what John and I talked about we look at -- when we're looking at the affiliate revenue line, that's really what we call it, the subs that are being reported. Those are the real hard-core subs, and there's always a difference between that and Nielsen, this is what we use with our advertisers and our clients to pay. So ...","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Where those up, Lori, the real subs in Q1 for the fully distributed networks versus down in the press release?","Lori A. Hickok","I'd have -- to be honest, I'd have to look and get back to you. What I know is they were better than our expectations. I think they were flat to maybe slightly up, and what were looking at for the full year was probably something more flat to down. Again, there's some seasonality to that. So there's it once when I get talking against our values and our expectations, is that we are expecting there could be more loss.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. Okay.","Lori A. Hickok","Okay. Did that help?","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, very much. And then my follow up, I guess, to Joe on the buyback. We sort of tortured you for 8 or so quarters on buying back your stock. So now that we'll torture you on, why did you increase it? The buyback pace in Q1 and this is the new run rate or is there some different thought process on the balance sheet and capital sort of allocation from here?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Ben, we didn't really increase the pace. We had a quiet period because of the bond financing that we did last fall. So we always had a certain pace in mind and we've stayed true to that so far. Obviously, we will continue that way because, again, we watch prices and we watch other factors in the market and so, I would have to say that the past is no indication on what we're going to do in the future, although we have not deliberately increased the pace in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Bank, RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","My question is, if you look at revenue growth year-over-year, kind of by channel and particularly for HG in ad growth, I should say, can you give us the portion of growth that was attributable to the sponsorship and sort of nontraditional 30-second spot kind of advertising? Thank you.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Well I would be unable to give you a specific number or percentage other than to say that it is not something that you can uniquely and discreetly pull out because it also helps secure other advertising. For instance, in the Dream Home, which is our biggest special, if you will, of the year on any of our networks, the advertisers that are in the Dream Home are there because of a significant commitment to Dream Home and other commitments as well and it helps drive other business, particularly due to the fact that it's non-cancelable. And so, to put a hard number on it, it wouldn't be easy other than to say that it's a significant reason why we tend to outperform our peers based on our premium pricing, or the high quality of our audience and our ability to tie our endemic advertisers into these programs that are non-cancelable and really can help support us through challenging quarters.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But, I guess, would you go as far as to say it's sort of a material contributor? Like why you can't quantify it, is it a couple of hundred basis points or really just impossible to quantify at all?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Well I'd be very comfortable saying that it is material, absolutely, and had you been with us at our upfront in New York last week and you see the presentation of how we integrate advertisers into these special events and what that means to those advertisers in terms of their results. It becomes material not just in the way we count money, but in the way our advertisers see us as a valuable, and in many cases, irreplaceable part of their marketing plan.","Kenneth W. Lowe","And David, this is Ken, if I could just tag on to that, I mean, this has been part of our DNA from the get-go and I think a lot of it centers around these categories and the fact that there's a lot of utility in the information, so we've been hand in glove with the advertising community, and I guess one reason we have such a great relationship, another reason why our networks do score so well in engagement, because we've been willing to do these partnerships and yet maintain a programming integrity, and it's something I think, that others are trying to get closer to, but being in these categories, really gives us a leg up, if you will.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov, Susquehanna Financial Group.","Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Joe, I have a question on the Travel Channel International acquisition. You mentioned that the EBITDA contribution is not really that material. I'm wondering, when you were looking at the acquisition, did do see any low hanging fruit there that could turn it into a more material contributor to the profitability? And if so, what would the drivers be and how soon would that happen?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Sure. Vasily, I think that the most important thing about the acquisition is the footprint that it provides for distribution, it's in a number, it's in 90-plus countries in 20-plus languages. And it's an opportunity for us to inject our programming into that distribution footprint and improve ratings. It's fair to say that it's in a lot of countries and some are much more promising than others. Certainly, we believe that it's a great footprint for us and a base of operations in Europe from which to build. So we do see a fair amount of low fruit, but it's to the, sort of with the revenue upside, more than it is, taking any costs out.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Thomas Eagan, Canaccord Genuity.","Frank Poerio","This is Frank Poerio calling in for Tom. With the Lifestyle segment profit margin being 50% in the first quarter versus 52% of last year, is the 50% margin what we should expect for the first half of the year before it rises in the second half?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Like I'd say, that's not unfair. We -- as we've said before, the cost drivers that affected the first quarter will certainly continue into the second quarter. And we don't give specific margin guidance, we don\u2019t manage to particular margin numbers, but certainly, it's not unreasonable to expect that the second quarter will look like the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan, Wunderlich Security.","Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","You have to be pretty happy with the UKTV investment and I know it's more a bouquet of general entertainment channels and all that, but are there any learnings you could extract from there to here? The British TV market is interesting, I know you did the BT Vision deal, I don't think that Good Food or Home are on that yet. But even beyond, just as a standalone basis, is there anything that really ties back to the larger corpus stateside when you look at what you've done?","John F. Lansing","Certainly, Matt, there's a lot of learnings every day there. I think that their market is similar to ours on the distribution side. That is, cable and satellite, are predominant in terms of the distribution mechanics there and that the relationship between programmers and distributors is every bit as delightful as it is here, in many cases. They -- the one thing about that market that I think is really instructive for us is that they are much more aggressive in digital distribution of content and the availability of some of the content, especially longform on multiple platforms. And to navigate a world where you have that challenge for viewers, as well as the normal challenges from regular threshold competition is important for us. And it's good learning for us as well. I'd say it's too early to say we've learned anything that's going to make a practical difference in the way we operate right here, but they are, I think in terms of the evolution of the marketplace, they're a little ahead of where we are.","Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","And specifically, with reference to BT Vision, is it just -- you're -- just too early?","John F. Lansing","It's a little early, we just did a deal at UKTV with BT Vision for some of the content and there's more, hopefully more down the road, but as you say it's too early for that.","Kenneth W. Lowe","And I think Matthew, just one quick thing, this is Ken, some of our longer-term aspirations, because of our programming generally flowing very well to international markets, we see an opportunity as we expand globally, to make that a two-way street if you will, where you'll probably see a little more international programming coming back this way as well. We've come across some \"stars\" in the Food category, for example, that we think will play very well here. So it's both offense and defense. We see some real opportunities, talent-wise, to exploit these brands globally and then maybe bring some of this talent back stateside.","Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","What Lori was talking about, \"Reza, Spice Prince of India\" down in South Africa, I think.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, no, yes, that's a good example.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Corty, Morningstar.","Michael Corty - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I had a question about the possibility of some online distribution at some point? And I realize this is an open-ended question, so I just wanted to get a little more insight into maybe, in the long run, how to value your content even more in terms of opportunities to get additional revenue streams. And question is, in terms of your major channels or brands like Food, HGTV, Travel, Cooking, are there certain programming or certain channels that you'd be a little more, I don't want to say aggressive, but would maybe, be a little more lenient towards giving the likes of a NetFlix or an Amazon more current content? With Travel, fully distributed, but not the audience you want long term and Cooking is a new but growing channel, the thought being, if that might grow your audience for that channel over time by putting it on like a different network? Balancing that versus obviously, Food and HGTV, which are very strong, and you might be a little more protective of that content. So any thoughts on that would be appreciated.","John F. Lansing","Sure, Michael, this is John. Of course the great advantage that we have is that we own the vast majority of all of our content, upwards of 90% to 95%, we own all the rights and that's why currently, we're in a $100 million digital business that's being driven largely by the growth in online video on our own sites. In the first quarter it was up significantly year-over-year. And to your point, the -- all of our brands have an audience and that audience is what we're after. The distribution mechanism to get there is something we're agnostic about, whether it's YouTube, whether it's Hulu or whether it's our websites, the point is that we have the ability to meet a consumer on any platform, on any device, and with premium pricing of content that we own. And I think, it operates a dual benefit for us as the direct improvement in revenue that we can drive and then it also expands our brand and meets our consumer wherever that consumer is, when they want to consume our content and in doing that, it helps build the brand, and helps keep that growth in a positive way going forward.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi, S&P Capital.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","I guess I wanted to get a sense, Ken, the GAC channel, it seems to me that you could be doing a lot more with it, given the scale that you have right now. So if you can perhaps speak to a long-term commitment that you have to that? And perhaps, anything's going on there? I know it's been kind of flying under the radar, but from a financial perspective, I was wondering if you had any targets for breakeven, or any kind of strategic changes that may kind of be on tap, and how long you intend to stay with it before perhaps kind of changing direction from a branding perspective would be helpful to understand.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Sure, Tuna, good morning. A fair question. As I said in my comments, it's been a bit under construction for several months now. You may have noted that we've moved more towards a living country lifestyle format, more in our sweet spot, more of the type of programming that really caters to the heartland of America. And so we're considering strategies to leverage the close relationship we have with Nashville, with the country music fans, they're all across the country. To aggregate that audience, we've invested a modest amount in programming, there's some shows like Day Jobs and Tom's Wild Life, that are starting to have a little traction just to supplement the music video experience, again, that I mentioned in my comments that we're moving away from a little bit. Look, there's definitely value in 62 million households, it's something that we take a great deal of pride in. This one is probably going to require just a little bit more time to see how this country lifestyle format develops. But right now, we're very optimistic. We like the team that we have. We like the opportunities in front of us and I think again, if you look at the success we're having with DIY, and the Cooking Channel, Cooking Channel is coming on pretty quickly. DIY has not been \"an overnight hit\" it's taken us a while to build that audience. We're patient, but we're patient to a point. I expect that network to continue to grow in value, for us to continue to build some valuable programming on it. And then, needless to say, our ad sales team is none better than extracting value from the audience we aggregate there. So all in all, we think there's a good future for GAC and believe me, it's front and center for us.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","Okay. That's a great answer. And if I can have a follow-up question on one of the -- with all due respect to you, I'm going to make it very quick. So on the digital comment, as you monetize your, the online traffic on your core sites, any kind of metrics that you can share with us as to the success, how you would gauge success on those, particularly given your reticence, it appears, on third-party distributors, just to get a sense of how you kind of monetize that? Is it just kind of in hard dollars? Or perhaps in promotional incremental benefits on the linear platform? So that'd be helpful.","John F. Lansing","Yes, Tuna, this is John. I know it's definitely hard dollars advertising against online video. Pricing has been very strong, as we've seen and our impressions are growing. In fact, foodnetwork.com had 36% growth in just video impressions in the first quarter with really solid CPM growth. And, but then, that we'll also look to monetize our content through any other business model that makes sense, as we, obviously, subscriptions make sense, direct-to-consumer, download to own, whatever it is. But the bottom line is, our content is valuable. We see that value flowing through our affiliate agreements, as we're improving our affiliate rates and we expect to see that same value flow through on any other platform.","Mark W.

Thank you, Dylan, and good morning, everyone. We're happy that you're able to be with us today.","What a year. 2015 was a milestone year for Scripps Networks Interactive. Revenues were up 13%, hitting $3 billion for the first time. Advertising revenues were up 14%, exceeding $2 billion for the first time. Adjusted segment profits up 13% to $1.3 billion, adjusted earnings per share up 25% to $4.94, and we completed the largest acquisition in the company's history, successfully transforming our international business through the acquisition of TVN. So quite a year indeed for the company and I just like to say thanks to all the dedicated employees that helped make this possible.","We have a pretty simple business philosophy. We fortify and protect our core brands. We extend our reach by creating new connections with consumers. And finally, we generate and extract value from each of those connections, whether it'd be on a television screen, a mobile device, or even the pages of a magazine. And we're doing that around the world.","With TVN, the leading multi-platform media company in Poland, our company firmly established itself in one of Europe's most vibrant economies and created a platform for future growth in this desirable region. Here in the United States, our television networks enjoyed another strong year. We once again outperformed our peer group as we continued to attract the upscale engaged audiences coveted by our advertisers.","As you'll hear from Burton shortly, our networks continue to be an essential element in the media plans of brands and agencies everywhere. We're meeting the challenges presented by changing media consumption habits. We've broadened our horizons and we made our value content available on a growing array of delivery platforms including television, tablets, and mobile to meet clear consumer demand. We're making smart strategic business moves that further position the company to take advantage of the evolving media landscape.","We consolidated all of our U.S. television content development under a new Chief Content & Brand Officer, Kathleen Finch, who's doing a fantastic job. It's a move that really makes it easier to tap the expertise and talent previously separated by brand. Truly made us a more cohesive and holistic organization.","At the same time, we're expanding beyond traditional distribution platforms and generating more on-demand and short-form content specific to the platform on which it's consumed. Our recent launch of the Scripps Lifestyle Studios reflects our progress in this area. We made positive strides in 2015 to let consumers access our content on their delivery platform of choice, and they responded by visiting our websites and mobile apps in ever-increasing numbers.","In 2015, we experienced strong revenue growth in advertising sales and content distribution. We united those under a single Chief Revenue Officer, Steve Gigliotti, who's tasked with maximizing all the company's monetization streams. We completed a companywide cost analysis and took necessary steps to bring costs in line with projected revenue. It's made us leaner and it's really enhanced our ability to move quickly when opportunities arise. Advertisers want to work with us and distributors consider our channels as the kind of must-carry brands their consumers demand. So in summary, 2015 was truly a transformational year for our company.","Over the last 20 years, we've established powerful brands that connect deeply with consumers across the world. We're growing revenues as we monetize audiences on all platforms. The solid consistent performance that our company exhibits quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year validates the efforts of our incredibly talented teams around the world as we build value for all of our shareholders. So I want to thank you again for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive.","And now, let me turn it over to Burton who has details on our strong fourth quarter results. Burton?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. The year 2015 ended strong and that strength has continued into the early part of 2016. Here are a just few highlights.","In 2015, both the HGTV and Cooking Channel recorded their best years ever. HGTV was one of only three top 10 cable networks to grow its ratings in 2015. It completed its ninth consecutive year as the number one network for upscale women and for the second year in a row was number one with women 25 to 54 on weekends. That's a time period that really serves as a second primetime sales opportunity for us. Food Network and Travel Channel experienced strong growth in the fourth quarter. And so far this year, all six of our networks are seeing ratings growth.","On HGTV some newer shows emerged as huge hits. Fixer Upper, a series about remodeling homes in Waco, Texas, has become one of the biggest shows in the network's history. It's just one example of how HGTV taps into the Heartland of America. New seasons of Flip or Flop, Hawaii Life and Property Brothers Home on the Ranch delivered high audiences, as did House Hunters, of course, our perennial franchise that we continue to expand to great effect.","At Food Network we've turned a corner on audience growth, especially among younger viewers. Millennial-appealing hits, like Cutthroat Kitchen, Camp Cutthroat and Worst Cook Celebrity drove 5% year-over-year growth in the valuable adults 25 to 34 age group. Family-friendly series like Halloween Baking Championship, Rachael Ray's Kids Cook-Off encouraged co-viewing by the whole family and increased younger viewers by double digits.","The 11th season of Food Network Star scored 15% higher ratings, becoming one of the summer's biggest success stories. And during fourth quarter, Food Network's overall viewership was up 5% over 2014. The network finished in the top 10 in women 25 to 54 and just outside the top 10 among adults.","Travel Channel also showed very positive movement, as some of the new shows we've been telling you about continued to gain traction. Overall, Travel Channel viewership was up an impressive 5% for the quarter and the network has maintained its positive performance into the New Year. Key contributors included Expedition Unknown, Bizarre Foods, and Booze Traveler. And we have a slate of new shows in the pipeline that we're confident will help continue the growth trend. Late last year we began to move some Travel Channel operations to our Knoxville headquarters, and we expect to gain additional creative synergies as that move plays out over the next few quarters.","Ratings at Cooking Channel continued to improve in the fourth quarter, maintaining healthy growth throughout the year. Cooking Channel finished 2015 with its sixth straight year of audience growth. For the fourth quarter, viewership soared 13% to record levels for adults and women ages 25 to 54. Moreover, the quarter was the youngest ever for primetime, thanks to strong growth in adults 25 to 54. Ratings growth resulted from successful original shows like Unique Eats and Sugar Showdown.","DIY Network had a strong 2015, the most-watched year ever for adults 18-plus and the second-highest year for adults 25 to 54, driven by shows like Rehab Addict and Barnwood Builders. And Great American Country experienced its most upscale year yet, as we continue its successful conversion to lifestyle programming.","Now, we talk a lot about television audiences, and linear television is thriving at Scripps Networks Interactive. We also benefit from the growing awareness of TV Everywhere. Usage of our watch apps increased nearly 300% in January versus a year earlier. Connected devices such as Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV already comprise more than one-third of our total TV Everywhere reach. We're working diligently to ensure that we attract the next generation of viewers and consumers. We've seen significant progress on our television networks and on over-the-top services, but we must also create content that is purposely designed for alternative formats.","At the end of 2015, we launched Scripps Lifestyle Studios. It's a dedicated editorial team that creates content specific to the platform on which it's consumed. It could be Facebook, Apple News, Snapchat or any of the many platforms that emerge every day, as well as our own digital properties, and it lets us take advantage of key audiences and advertising opportunities while also reaching digital natives.","An early example featured Chef Bobby Flay and his daughter, Sophie, starring in a series of cooking videos that aired on Snapchat. This approach to content generation gives us greater agility to take advantage of advertising opportunities. We're able to integrate advertisers into authentic storytelling. This helps clients reach high-value audiences on the digital platforms they love and translates that engagement into deeper connection and transactions.","I want to expand a little now on our international progress. TVN group closed 2015 with a strong 22% share of the adults 16 to 49 television audience in Poland and its spring season has opened with strong numbers. The program MasterChef Junior and the new drama series, Second Chance, scored the best season premier ratings since 2013 across all TV channels in Poland.","TVN continued to shine in its over-the-top strategy. More than 1.7 million people have registered with the TVN Player, making it one of the top five distribution platforms in the country. We continue to view TVN as a great asset for the engaged audiences its networks aggregate. We also see good opportunity to leverage TVN as a launch pad for expanding Scripps' presence in this important region.","Now, while TVN provided the year's big international headline, the company experienced substantial growth in other parts of the world as well. Food Network, our most widely distributed global brand, is now available in more than 150 countries. It's the top lifestyle channel in the UK and has seen substantial success in Southeast Asia and more recently in Latin America and Australia. Travel Channel, our second-most distributed brand, is viewed in more than 130 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia-Pacific region. HGTV debuted on the international scene just about a year ago. It's already the number one lifestyle channel in Singapore and is growing rapidly in Malaysia and the Philippines.","Additionally, our international-only brands, Asian Food Channel and Fine Living Network, enjoyed strong growth in 2015. Asian Food Channel allows us to develop locally-produced shows specific to Asian markets, while with Fine Living Network we can showcase the best of our content from the home, food and travel categories on a single network in markets where that approach works best.","From Knoxville to New York to Warsaw and Singapore on TV screens, tablets and smartphones, we're connecting with millions of consumers worldwide every day, every way. And we're taking advantage of new ways to monetize the close relationships we develop. That's our goal. That's our commitment.","And now, I'll turn it over to Lori who'll review financial performance.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. Since you've seen our strong results, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers that Ken mentioned, discuss our segment performance, provide guidance and then open it up for Q&A.","2015 was a great year for Scripps Networks Interactive. Revenue increased an impressive 13%, surpassing $3 billion for the first time. Driving this growth was a strong advertising market for our lifestyle brands, growth in affiliate fees and the significant expansion of our international business through TVN. This strong revenue growth, coupled with focused cost control helped in part by our 2014 announced restructuring and early retirement effort, translated to a 13% growth in adjusted segment profit and adjusted EPS growth of 25% compared with the prior year.","For the fourth quarter, total company revenue was up 27%. Contributing to this growth was the inclusion of TVN and strong advertising growth and affiliate fee increases primarily at the U.S. Networks segment, which I'll discuss in more detail later.","Total adjusted segment profit increased 19%, driven by strong revenue growth partially offset by increases in cost of services, primarily programming expense. Also contributing to the expense growth were international increases related to the inclusion of TVN. Adjusted net income attributable to SNI was $1.35 per diluted share, up 35% due to the operating improvements noted previously.","We had a great quarter at our U.S. Networks segment. Revenues increased 8%, driven by strong advertising demand for our lifestyle networks as well as continued affiliate fee growth. For the advertising revenue, improved scatter pricing coupled with CPM price increases from the 2015-2016 upfront and calendar upfront markets drove an 8% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter. Scatter versus scatter CPM pricing was up high-single to low-double-digits year-over-year and up high teens to low 20%s over the broadcast upfront.","Our top five advertising categories during the quarter were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, auto and pharmaceutical. These categories are fairly consistent with prior periods except pharma, which was stronger than normal in the fourth quarter. This strong advertising market has continued into the first quarter with scatter versus scatter CPM pricing up high-single to low-double-digits year-over-year and up teens to low 20%s over the new broadcast upfront.","For affiliate fees, contributing to the 5% growth were contractual rate escalators with our traditional distribution partners, incremental distribution increases that we negotiated in some recent renewals for both DIY Network and Cooking Channel, and new distributions related to broadband providers.","Looking at our adjusted segment profits, and as Burton mentioned for the fourth quarter of 2015, our networks realized positive ratings momentum that has continued into 2016. Helping to drive this performance was the decision to shift programming premieres to the fourth quarter, which also allowed us to take advantage of a robust advertising market. However, this record amount of new programming also drove an increase in programming expense for the quarter.","Additionally, and as indicated on previous calls, we focused on developing programming themes for the Travel Channel to develop a strong network identity. We've reevaluated our programming library and elected to write off a larger-than-normal amount of Travel Channel programming in the fourth quarter. As a result of these decisions, our adjusted segment profit was down 1% for the quarter. However, we believe the longer-term trend will be a continued deceleration in the rate of programming expense growth consistent with what we've seen over the past couple of years.","Our international revenues of $163 million increased significantly due to the consolidation of TVN, coupled with growth in our existing international business. TVN revenues were up 7% in local currency compared to the same quarter a year ago, while revenues from our existing operations were up 17% on an organic basis. International segment profit was a healthy $36 million compared with a loss of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This $44 million improvement is primarily due to the inclusion of TVN as we are still investing in our existing international lifestyle networks.","In addition to our consolidated results, we have significant international operations reported in our equity earnings. In total, our equity in earnings of affiliates was $11 million, down compared with the prior-year fourth quarter primary due to transaction-related accounting adjustments and seasonality related to the TVN minority investments we acquired.","On the balance sheet, I want to touch on a couple of items. As you've seen, reflecting the confidence management has in the business to continue to generate strong operating free cash flow, we've increased our dividend for the sixth consecutive year to $1.00 per share annually. Within our capital allocation priorities, we're focused on using operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our leverage and invest in M&A, both in the U.S. and internationally.","We ended the fourth quarter at approximately 3.2 times growth leverage, and we recently notified Cox Communication of our intent to purchase their 35% stake in Travel Channel. This notification started the valuation process for the transaction and we expect the transaction will be completed by the end of first quarter.","Finally, and before we open it up for questions, we'll provide our full year 2016 guidance. All guidance is based on total company results. As a result of the strong demand for our networks from viewers and advertisers, along with an increasing contribution from international, we expect revenue growth of approximately 12%. We believe the revenue increase will be driven primarily by a full year of TVN results and growth in advertising revenue. We expect for the first half of 2016 the company will realize a higher growth rate due in part to easier advertising comps at the U.S. Networks segment and because TVN results were not included in the first half of 2015.","We expect the third quarter will be impacted by the Olympics, and to a lesser extent, the Presidential election. So it should be the slowest growth quarter of the year. Then growth should accelerate somewhat for the fourth quarter of 2016.","We expect adjusted segment profit to increase approximately 7%. Adjusted segment profit excludes TVN transaction integration costs, restructuring and reorganization costs for 2015 and 2016.","Impacting the 2016 segment profit growth will be a larger proportionate share of international revenues which have an inherently lower segment profit profile compared to our U.S. Networks, a change in our program amortization policy and estimation rate for certain programming across the network, and the likely impact from a one-time rate equalization process due to the expected renewal of certain distributor agreements that are being consolidated. After this initial period, we expect to realize mid- to high-single-digit annualized pricing increases per subscriber. These three items impact our estimated adjusted segment profit growth by 500 basis points to 600 basis points.","We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be $120 million to $125 million. This estimate excludes $52 million of TVN purchase price adjustments. We will also exclude purchase price adjustments from our adjusted earnings per share calculation.","We expect interest expense to be approximately $135 million, and lastly, our tax rate should be 30% to 32% for the year.","And with that, we're ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","This question is from Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, great. Thanks so much. I mean, I think a couple of things pop out. One, with advertising being this strong, can you just give us a sense of, if you would, how the calendar upfront sort of ended up in terms of rate or volume and what your thinking is as you head into this year's upfront? I mean, it was helpful getting the cadence around how you think advertising flows for the year, but as we just sort of think about the setup going forward with your ratings doing a bit better. And then any detail that you have on change in programming amortization, the rationale and sort of what you changed from and to would be helpful?","And then if you wouldn't mind me throwing a third in there, just anything in terms of new entrants into distribution that you would comment on at this point. It seems like there's a lot of conversations going on and by the middle of the year, we might have some new entrants launch. Do you think you'll be available on any new platforms or bundles that launch or is that something that's still uncertain at this point? Thank you.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","All right. Well, great, Doug. We'll tackle all three. This is Burton to start on the ad sales, and then we'll go to Lori and then Ken for the others.","The calendar upfront was very strong for us. With scatter pricing where it is, I think the advertisers want to get their money down and try to not play in that scatter market if they can avoid it because pricing is so high. But calendar is always strong for us because especially on the home side, it's where endemics in the home category really put their money down. That's the way they're buying calendar works.","And so, we're seeing that continued strength. We're very happy with it. And I have to say going into the upfront, we're feeling good. Ratings at all six of our networks are up. That's a great position to be in as we tout the strength of our brands and the quality of our audience.","We're still upscale. We've got a great story. In fact, our ad sales group is meeting this week for their national sales meeting. I was with them yesterday. I'll be with them this afternoon. And they're as upbeat as they can be given where we are with our networks and where they are in the marketplace.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Doug. And I'll tackle the program amortization question as it should be no surprising when we periodically look at how we're estimating our amortization, how it matches with revenue and how shows are being premiered. And as a result, we're accelerating our amortization in the first year for certain networks and it's having a one-time adjustment as we change the policy.","So what you'll see is an impact when you see our cost of sales numbers and the growth rate, probably call it from a 1 point to 2 points impact for the year, depending on when the shows premier. So, again, we get past 2016, it'll be no longer an impact. So I'd call it a non-cash amortization impact. So I hope that helps you a little bit, but we continue to look at these things.","And again, I think with the collapse of the networks all under Kathleen's leadership, we might continue to relook at how we're using programming and how that might impact. So we'll keep you in tune, but on a ongoing basis, our investment is still moderating from a cash basis. So, again, if you look at what the dollars going out the doors, we're still moderating. If we go back in time, we were probably, as we brought in Travel, we were more at the high teens. We've moderated that to the low teens, and now we're in the \u2013 I would call we're closely, and without this adjustment, probably in the high-single digit zone, which is what we've been striving to do over the last couple of years.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","And maybe, Lori, it would be helpful, if this is sort of new original programming, are they've been amortized now sort of over a two-year period rather than three-year period? I mean, if you can you give us a sense of just how much is amortized in the first year versus what it was prior.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Again, it's on network-by-network so I can't give you a blanket answer. But I would say for certain of our bigger networks, what we're doing is that the life is the same, but we're amortizing more in the first year. So what's happening as that first year that's being amortized, you're going to see a bigger chunk. So for the premieres in 2016 for certain networks, some of our larger ones, they'll going to take a bigger proportion of that amortization year one, which they'll get the benefit in year two, three, and four. So, again, anytime we make changes in the amortization, it takes some time to funnel through and that's why I point back to the cash investment because that's the better indicator of what we're spending and what you'll see over time.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Doug, since you were able to slide that third question in on potential new entrants regarding distribution, instead of speculating that, I think the best way to answer that question is up to this point, we've been included in each and every so-called skinny bundle or going back to DISH's Sling, which in some ways started some of the alternative distribution delivery systems.","We're across the board. And you heard me say in my comments we're must-have. So I think it's safe to say that any alternative distribution platforms going forward, high likelihood that we'll be in those. But at this point, that's pretty speculative as to who they will be and where they will be and when they will launch. But we should be there.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks so much.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Doug.","Operator","A question from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on Doug's second question on amortization and one for Burton. Lori, when you look at the relationship between cash spending on programming and your program amortization, this year it's about 12% greater, so cash spend was 12% greater than the amort level. So I wonder if you just look at it that way, do we think it looks like mid to high-single digits next year in that relationship? Because it's really coming down every year. So is that the right way to think about the balance between cash spending and amortization?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","What I would say, including the impact of this amortization, you probably see that moderating down from what you're seeing. So we're, again, depending on the timing of premieres and what we're planning which always changes throughout the year, I would say we are hovering right around that 10% range and making the way down to like the 8% to 10% range. So, again, say we were at the 10% to 12% a year ago, now we're 9% to 10% with this impact in there. So, again, we're continuing to moderate.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And, Burton, let's go to Travel for a second. You guys recently named Courtney White to be the Head of Programming at Travel. I noticed since you acquired Travel, there's been a lot of changes in divisions. I wonder what's division now \u2013 what's Courtney's division? And then what kind of program expense growth do you expect at Travel distinctly, given the reboot?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Program expense should continue very much along the lines that we have always said. We had invested more. As Lori just said a few moments ago, the percentage growth there was higher, but that's been moderating. We expect that moderation to continue. And the reason is that even though Courtney is new coming in to Travel, what we've learned about the Travel audience and Travel programming over the last 18 months is what we intended. You may recall over the last several quarters, we've been saying that we're going to put a lot of programming on, new programming in the fourth quarter. We did. We learned a lot about what we put on. As always in TV, some worked, some didn't. So now we have better direction going forward.","Courtney, she's got a long history with us, 10 years. Long history in the business before that. She is very adept at articulating a very clear rationale for why programs need to be on the air. And so she's very craftily divided what's working on Travel into several groups of kinds of shows. And we're going to be pursuing those because we've seen that they work. You'll see a lot of adventure quest shows in the guise of Expedition Unknown. We like seeing personalities like Andrew Zimmern and others like in Booze Traveler and Bizarre Foods going out and exploring the world. You'll see more of that. You'll see more pairs of people traveling because we like dynamics between them.","And we're going to bring a little dose of celebrity to the network as well. We've got Queen Latifah with a new show, she'll start off in South America. And then we've got other celebrities coming on, too. So a lot of what we learned from the current programming at Travel that's working, what Courtney learned at HGTV, we're going to bring to bear. And I have to tell you, she is moving forward at a very fast pace to make all this work.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","And, Michael, I just want to clarify, when I've been talking about that, that's been U.S. Networks. You got to keep in mind, we're bringing in international and when you're looking at the balance, you've got the six-month impact of TVN. So I just want to make sure that that's clear.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","A question from Vasily Karasyov with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Good morning. A quick follow-up on the guidance. Can you please tell us when the rate equalization will start impacting the growth rate and when we will lap it?","And then on advertising, it used to be the case that cable networks argued that their advertising pricing is only a fraction of what broadcast networks get for similar programming. So I was wondering if you could give us an idea where you are in that relationship in pricing and if there is still a headroom for you to catch up with that and what's driving those discount.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","On your first question on the timing of the rate equalization, we're really going to stay somewhat silent on that. This is just our estimated impact for the year as we're still negotiating that. I think you're quite familiar with all of the mergers going on, but we expect that to have an impact throughout the year. And that when we get to next year this is a one time and done and we will start to see those mid to high-single digit pricing increases. So we really look at this as a one-time item, 2016, and then we're back to normal rates of growth next year.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Vasily, this is Burton. Thanks for that question because it gives me a chance on behalf of our ad sales team to say there still is a gap in pricing and we are working very hard to close it, but we think we have some tremendous advantages to be able to do that. The quality of our audience is unmatched in television. High income, highly educated with a great preponderance to buy the products that they see advertised on our networks. That's indisputable and based on outside research, not our own research. And we are at the top in those attributes.","Moreover, as data becomes more of a commodity in the selling of advertising, we're going to excel. Purchasing data, our audiences buy stuff. They have the money, they have disposable income, they go out and buy things. You're seeing pricing increases, as Lori pointed out in our scatter, we think we're going to continue to close that gap and we think we have a lot of headroom to do so because of the quality of our content, the nature of our environment in which the ads run and, most importantly, the quality of that audience.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from David Joyce with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI","Thanks. So I was wondering if you could provide some more color on the seasonality of your various international businesses, particularly TVN, both on the advertising programming expenses, how that should phase throughout the year and then anything we should think about in terms of affiliate deals coming up. Thank you.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","In terms of seasonality, I think particularly related to TVN, you'll see not unlike U.S. networks that there will be increased programming spend typically in the fall and leading into the fourth quarter when new premieres are on the air, as well as in the first quarter when we premier our spring seasons. So you'll see some seasonality there. Obviously, TVN as a group has 12 channels and so among the thematic channels, less seasonality more typical of cable networks.","David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from David Juenger (sic) [Todd Juenger] (34:24) with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","This is Todd Juenger, I guess David's brother. A couple quick ones. Listen, one quick one on guidance and then want to explore a little bit on the programming side. So, I know you're giving guidance on a consolidated basis now and that's fine. I just wondered, just deducing what that means for sort of U.S. domestic, I think it's pretty clear that if we were to think about what U.S. domestic advertising growth rate is embedded in the guidance you gave, it seems like it might be the same or maybe a slight acceleration from this year, maybe the higher end of mid singles. If you'd comment on that in any way, I think it'd be helpful.","And then kind of related to that, anybody who wants to just help opine on the theory here, we've been observing \u2013 when we see your ratings go up, which is rare in this world, it seems to be tied very closely to when you put new episodes of your TV programs on the air, which is great news because it shows when you have a hit show and you put a new episode on, people watch it. It also begs the question of how \u2013 are you more dependent than ever before on having to have new episodes and what does that mean for rate of continued spend in investment? Is the world different now, do you think, than it was a couple of years ago in how sensitive the audience is to new programming versus the life span of reruns of those? Thank you.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That was a good question. You're also smarter than your brother. Go ahead, Lori.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I will give you a little color on the total company revenue guidance. And, yes, on the U.S. Networks, we are seeing acceleration year-over-year, which would not be surprising on the growth rate coming out of the fourth quarter. Again, we saw strong pricing coming out of the upfront versus our peer set. We've got great demand with impressions. So, yeah, I think it's the story of pricing. And just like you're seeing, we're seeing strong scatter.","We're seeing \u2013 the calendar was very strong. Options are at normal levels. So we're feeling again that it's going to be a very good year. It's going to be better than last year. But unlike last year, which I think we talked a lot about, that acceleration throughout the year where we started out slow, it's the first half we think is going to be very strong due to some of the things I said in my prepared comments is that it was softer in the first half so we got pricing plus our impressions are all up. So all very good. And we're seeing a little more strength there than we did last year.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","And, Todd, on programming, you and I could probably have like an hour-long discussion about that because it's such a nuance question. In general, though, I would say your premise is right that television audiences, in general, have less tolerance for reruns. And that's why you're seeing a lot of what's going on in the television industry, overall. It's also why we responded many years ago in fact, when Jim Samples was running HGTV, to that by putting into production 300 episodes and 400 episodes a year of House Hunters. Very reasonably priced show for us, drives a lot of viewing, we decided that's worth the investment in original content.","It becomes more nuance, though, because each network is a little different in our mix and even within a network, different kinds of shows are different when it comes to repeatability. Competition shows like the Food Network Star, they don't repeat very well. And so over time, I'm sure you've observed, you've seen us do fewer and fewer big stunt-type shows. HGTV, in fact, is backing off a lot on that; Food Network is scaling them down a little bit. They don't repeat as well. They're great when they run, but they don't repeat as well.","On the other hand, a show like Fixer Upper, which is far and away right now the number one show on HGTV, the team there is so good in understanding when audiences are watching the network on certain nights that they realize that Fixer Upper on Tuesday night was getting an audience, but Fixer Upper reruns on Wednesday \u2013 on Thursday night, rather, could get a difference audience that haven't seen it. Sure enough, they put it on Thursday night, we actually promoted it, the first time we've ever promoted repeats of a show, and the ratings were nearly 100% as what they were on Tuesday night.","So there are ways for us to utilize reruns, recognizing the way audiences view in different patterns on our networks. So, yes, you'll see more original programming. Although, as Lori said, we're not going to go crazy on our program budgets. We think we have the right number of hours and we can make the mix work.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I will definitely take you up on that hour-long conversation on the (38:57) topic. Thank you very much.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right, Todd. Thanks.","Operator","A question from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your capital allocation priorities. I guess on the slide, there's a mention on M&A. On just high-level, can you talk about your appetite for traditional and digital assets, I guess particularly on the domestic front and what types of characteristics you're looking for? And then secondly, how might the buy-in or the Cox transaction impact your guidance or leverage? Thank you.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Well, as I said earlier, I think when we look at our capital allocation priorities, it's starting with just organic growth which is embedded in the guidance we gave you, highly continue to grow international. We're focused on delevering.","On the M&A side, we're looking on the digital front for opportunistic more tuck-ins, I would say, than outright big things. Again, in these high valuations, those valuations may come down but they're not of as actionable.","And then on the international front, we just did the big TVN transaction, and Jim and his team are focused on making that work as successfully as possible, taking the benefit of that. And, again, there's not a lot of big international opportunities that come on the horizon. So, of course, anything that comes, we will take a look; keeping in mind that we're trying to delever so that we can take advantage of those opportunities when they come.","Again, our priority is on investing our cash flows for things that generate growth and cash flow. So, again, we've always got a 6-month to 12-month window that we're looking. Also, on the Travel, that's already embedded in our delevering plan. We think that we can ingest that and really take care of that so we continue to delever. That's our focus. We think we'll be in great shape as we continue throughout the year and when we round out 2016.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. If you could just please remind us I guess where we are in the cycle of affiliate renewals, sort of what percentage are left in sort of plan? And do you think there's further opportunity ahead for, I guess, more distribution like we just saw on the smaller networks just sort of combat maybe the overall industry shrinkage?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Alexia. On the renewal cycle, I think we've talked that we're in a new renewal cycle that started in 2014. It was a two- to three-year process that, as you know, what you expect to do and how those negotiations go change over time, dates change, rights that people want are different. But I think we've got a year with some negotiations that will moderate over the next few years and then, again, we'll hit another renewal cycle. So I would say we're probably rounding the curve on this renewal cycle and ready to maybe be more moderate for the next couple of years.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And in terms of the distribution?","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Alexia. I think if you think of my remarks this morning, what we're doing as a company is transforming to a certain degree to different platforms. So, while the overall traditional distribution model that we all have admired for 20 years has come under some scrutiny in the last year or so as far as growth and stagnation, we're finding new ways to reach consumers in different platforms in different packages. And I think Doug upfront mentioned maybe some new entrants coming on.","So, if you look at our total business operation domestically and you realized we're having probably in 21 years some of our best ratings years ever, it's because we're attracting newer audiences and growing still even though some of the distribution, as I said, has waned a bit on the traditional platforms. But as we see opportunities on alternative distribution platforms, we're going for them.","I mentioned the Scripps Lifestyle Studios that we've created to do more short-form programming. We're very much about taking our content and our categories and continuing to grow it but now on different distribution platforms. And we're having enormous success on the TV Everywhere model as far as take rates and SVOD in general. So, we think the future for us is a bright one, but we're going to have to be more creative and ingenious in how we do reach future consumers on their platform of choice, if you will.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just a follow-up, if I might, and I think you did speak about the buy-ins for the rest of Travel and, of course, the focus on international growth as well. Is it possible, I guess, Food Network \u2013 the rest of Food Network buy-in still sort of on the horizon, albeit probably not near term?","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Alexia, we've been answering this question a long time. It's somewhere on the horizon. It's out there. But, look, it's a broken record. You've heard us say it many times. At the right price and at the right multiple, it makes all the sense in the world, just like bringing in the rest of Travel does. And if that opportunity ever presents itself, we will be prepared.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","A question from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Two topics. First, on the rate equalization process, just a follow-up there. The impact that you're anticipating in the coming year, is that only related to the major consolidation that we saw over the last year and there's another major consolidation \u2013 distribution consolidation in the marketplace right now? Would you anticipate a similar impact from that consolidation as well? Or is there something unique about that that wouldn't have the same type of impact?","And then my second question, you spoke a couple of times about content being specifically designed for other platforms, a unique approach. It seems like other platforms would be more competitive. It seems perhaps an easier place for a third-party to come in and try to maybe take some share for you. So can you talk strategically why you're better positioned to create that? Like what are you doing that's unique that maybe somebody, a new entrant coming into the space couldn't do? Thanks.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Michael, why don't we go with the second part of that question first? Burton, go ahead.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. You're right. There are not as many barriers to entry on other platforms, although it does depend on the platform.","Our basic position is we don't automatically win on other platforms the way we do in television. We have to be incredibly competitive. We have to look at what competitors are doing. We have to understand audiences, particularly younger audiences who may not in some cases be as familiar with our TV brands, although I'd point out we told you today that millennial audiences actually are growing on our TV networks and we do attract them there.","And so, the way we talk about it internally strategically is we're in the same business we were in television when it comes to new platforms. We create great content. We attract desirable audiences, branded content in many cases, and we've got to compete just as aggressively on new platforms as we did on TV. No guarantee that we'll win, but we have a long history of success of knowing audiences in our categories, of sticking to our categories, of researching our categories and knowing advertisers in our categories.","And so I have to say, we bet on ourselves to do well in those environments. Maybe not everyone, but the preponderance I think I will be very well.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Michael, if I might add, this goes both ways. You heard me mention Kathleen Finch's name earlier. One of the things that Kathleen and her team are doing now in looking at new talent, we'll go out to social media, we'll go out to the YouTubes. We will actually recruit talent because their ultimate goal is to be on our networks. And you will see more of that in the future.","We've already looked at some of the programming lineups that's coming up I hope, I guess, in the next few months, Burton, where we'll tapping into some of this talent. So it's not just for us to try to create content for those platforms, we'll find out what's working. And in some areas where we can recruit the talent, bring him in to our company. We can enhance that talent by offering them larger platform and different social media outlets to expand their personality, their brand, their talent as well. And so far, we've had a pretty good success rate with the ones we've recruited in.","So it's a little bit of the two-way street. This is new territory for us in some ways, but pretty exciting. And I think, Lori, you're going to take the second part of the question.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Michael. To try to give you some help on your equalization question because we really don't talk about specific negotiations and where they are, but I think maybe this will help you get to where you are by triangulating what I'm saying. One, you heard from an earlier question that we're rounding the bend on our last large grouping of affiliate renewals. Not much in the horizon past 2014 for some time. And that we, of course, are estimating that there's going to be an impact from these consolidations that are happening. And that's embedded in that 500 basis points to 600 basis points, which includes the other things where we've got an increasing amount of internationals in the first six months as well as the program amortization. So there's an impact there.","But I would like to stress again it's a one-time item. And then we get to 2017, again, we're looking for mid to high-single digits. So we really just have to get through this year. We tried to give you enough color based on what we're seeing and what's in our pipeline to help you work on your models for 2016.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Just to be clear, though, it includes both completed consolidations and any potential from contemplated consolidations in the marketplace right now is what's embedded in your outlook for the 2016 and then sort of the 2017 dynamic?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Again, the way I would answer that is this is our last year of probably a big round of negotiations and it calms down considerably after this year.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","So you could deduce that.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Qualify it.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","A question from Ryan Fiftal with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Two, if I may. One, you mentioned I think it was a 300% increase in the use of TV Everywhere apps. Can you talk about what was driving that step function increase? And then more broadly, can you talk a little about the relative monetization of viewers on your TV Everywhere apps versus your linear networks?","And then second, I just had a clarification for Lori. You mentioned after the rate equalization you expect to return to mid to high-single digit growth. Is that a comment on rate or revenue? Thanks.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Well, let me tackle TV Everywhere first. Last summer, and I believe we talked about this on calls, we started aggressively promoting our TV Everywhere watch apps, primarily on our three big networks, HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel. We began to see significant downloads of our own watch apps at that point. And they're growing by tens of thousands of additional downloads each month.","The Roku, Amazon Fire and Apple TV apps are connected devices, so you watch through a television. Those have a very large existing base already. So the goal there was to make the existing users of those devices aware that our apps were now available. They became available toward the end of last year. And we're seeing huge downloads of those apps over the first three months that they've been available.","The viewing, of course, is another matter. Once you have the apps, you then have to view. So the viewership we're pushing aggressively on air as well. So we have a two-part promotion message on TV. One is get the app. The second is now you can watch your favorite programs anytime, anywhere, any device if you have the app, and that's both live viewing and delayed viewing. And so it really is a very coordinated promotional effort to try to get viewers to understand you can watch us now more often anywhere, anytime on any device. And I have to say it's early days, but we're seeing it work.","On monetization, these are still small numbers against the overall linear television universe. So monetization will come. We have to start getting the habit in their now. It comes in a couple of ways. Of course, in C3 we can monetize all those connected devices right away because Nielsen measures anything that comes through a TV. On the apps that people are viewing on their pads or phones, C3 will be a little bit of a wait to monetize until Nielsen gets the measurement in order and we sign up for that additional measurement product.","However, on insertion after C3, that's all monetizable. Now, again, that's small right now, but we see that as a potential growth area for the insertion dynamic, insertion of ads. So we're getting the habits in place now for viewing, but we expect to see monetization grow as time goes on.","Jim Samples - President, International","Brian, this is Jim Samples. I would just add at TVN in Poland, we're seeing tremendous response to our non-linear offering there. We have 1.7 million registered users already for the TVN Player. And because TVN produces and owns much of its content, we have a lot of flexibility both to put that content out there and to monetize it through their ad sales house. So it's a terrific market for us to explore and to understand the dynamics of user behavior off of the television.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","And then, Ryan, on your question about was that percentage a rate or a revenue number, it is a pricing (53:11) and then of course you'd have to factor in your point of view on what you think is going to happen on the subscriber growth or not. But, again, I would remind you that of course we've been very successful in getting into those skinny bundles and really keeping our numbers more whole than maybe some of our other competitors.","Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Next question is from Ben Mogil with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. On the Cox deal, can you remind us again, is it an arbitration, what the mechanism around the buyout is, if you will?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","There is a process. There's a prescribed process in valuation. It's a typical one where we get a value, they get a value. And if they're within a certain amount, you're fine. If not, there's a third. So it's a very orderly process.","Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And just tied to that as well, are there any cost savings we should expect now that you take it all in, maybe don't have some governance or duplicative costs from there?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Not that would be of any material nature.","Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Ben.","Operator","Question is from Laura Martin with Needham. Please go ahead.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning, guys. Great numbers. Congratulations.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","So I want to go back to. you were one of the few \u2013 as you said, all six of your channels are up in ratings. And you highlighted some of these younger demos, which we're still fighting over whether kids watch TV. So what I am really interested in is how much of your digital experimentation do you think is driving those numbers? Or to refer to a prior question, is it just that you're doing more episodes online? Is it 90% because of what you're doing on the air is driving these ratings higher? Or do you think some of these digital initiatives that you've had in place for years are actually \u2013 we're seeing it in the Nielsen numbers on your channels? I'm very interested in that.","And then sort of two others. Lori, one for you. Could you remind us the impact of political in your fourth quarter historically so we can build that into our fourth quarter model? I noticed you called out Olympics as being a negative in the third quarter, but remind us how political affects you guys. And then C7 versus three C3, we're hearing a lot of people say they think this upfront, they can move to C7. Is that a goal of yours or do you prefer to stay at C3? Are you pushing for C7 in this upfront?","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right, Laura. Let me take a swing at the first question, which is a good one, and then I'll pass it on to Burton. I think it's both. I think it's both the areas that we've moved into in digital, what we're finding. We'll call it experimentation because it is a little bit. This works \u2013 maybe this doesn't work, but more emphasis here.","But I also think it underscores the fact that millennials watch television and are going to continue to watch television, much of it for us, Laura, has to do with 25- to 34-year-olds growing into the category. Once they start to become interested in the design of their apartment or their condo or if they're fortunate enough, their home, food, similarly once you start preparing meals, once it becomes a little bit more of a family environment, then our content just naturally kind of clicks in. And so what we've seen is not only the increases in ratings overall but the increases, as you mentioned, in millennials, but a lot of it has do with traditional television watching.","Now, no question they're using mobile in different ways. They're using other platforms in different ways. And we're experimenting over there and we're also using the investments that we've made in Tastemade, Refinery29 to see how those take rates are among millennials who's responding there. So I don't know if you agree with that, Burton, but I think it's a mixture of both.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Correct. I agree. Well said.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. All right.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","And then on your political question, Laura, really it's two parts. One, it's more about viewership during the \u2013 and again, it's not as big as the Olympics, but basically when there's debates going on and you get close to the elections, we expect there may be some impact on our networks and viewership, probably more HGTV than others. And then again on the revenue side, again, that's more of a local play than a national play. That's why you see usually a big lift on the broadcast players versus us.","But if there gets to be lots of demand and they can't get all their local and you might see a little spillover on us. But really, again, it's more of a viewership and impact on our top line and that's why we've got just a little bit of a hedge, for lack of a better word, built into our plan for 2016.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. And I should just reiterate, it's Burton, we don't hate political advertising nationally. You may see political ads on our networks, but those are in local insertions. But we've kept our networks politics-free for a good reason.","On C3 versus C7, I was just talking to our ad sales team a couple of weeks ago at our strategy meeting on that question. No, we're not expecting a big move to C7 for us. Remember, a huge percentage anywhere upwards of 90% of viewing of our networks is live and advertisers like that because they can make sure their messages are appearing when they intend them to. So we will not expect to see, for us, anyway a big shift to C7 in the coming upfront.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Can you follow up on Snapchat specifically? What sort of view have you learned from your Snapchat experimentation on the Discover platform? And what surprised you there?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","It's been a great learning experience. And in fact, it was sort of the initial impetus for forming the Scripps Lifestyle Studios. And what we learned was that we really do have to produce content in a different way for that particular format. And I'm not just talking about vertical versus horizontal shot video, but the way the video is created.","And so, we have gone to school very quickly. We worked very closely with the Snapchat team. They're very good partners in helping us understand that audience. And we want to work together to do a better job in attracting audiences there.","So we have gone to school. We have reoriented some of our creation of content to be much quicker in producing a lot of short-form video in our offices with a phone and using our staff to do it and it's really paid off.","Oh, and we're actually doing a little experiment with Snapchat coming up later this week at the South Beach Food Festival. You'll be able to see live feeds from the South Beach Food Festival that we're doing in partnership with Snapchat and we're kind of excited about that, too.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Laura.","Operator","Our last question today will come from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thanks for fitting me in there. Two quick questions for you. First, looking at your international set networks, the segment profit margin for that line item, I'm just curious what's the normalized margin that you can look at going forward from this business line? And then, secondly, where do you think it can trend over the next couple of years? And then as a follow-up to that, when you look at your corporate expense line, is that \u2013 should we think of that like a stable expense item now on the EBITDA line? Or how should we be looking at that line?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Okay, Eric. Just a couple of things and I'll let Jim chime in. On the International Networks, I think we have to go out a year or two to probably give you what we're striving for because we're continuing to invest. So I think, again, we're striving to get closer to those 30% margins over time, maybe getting to 25% before that.","So I'd look at milestones. And again, you could look at TVN when we acquired it and look at what kind of margin it was doing, which, of course, it's going to proportionally contribute more than the other things that are growing. But it's still an investment story. But, of course, we think that we're going to see margin growth over the coming years, but we're going to balance that with investments.","I don't know, Jim, if you want to add anything.","Jim Samples - President, International","And if you look at sort of the last two quarters of 2014, I think you'll get a feel for the scale of where we're investing beyond TVN in those networks that we've been launching around the world. Obviously very different financial profiles from the networks that we launched from scratch versus those more mature networks that we have acquired, but very good progress in revenue growth in those networks that we've launched as the distributions increase and as we've brought advertisers on board.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","And then regarding your question on is corporate stable, I hope we're stable. But corporate, I would say those costs are pretty good indicator of where we're going. Of course, as we've tried to do over the last couple of years, we continue to look at how we can be more efficient and operate including the corporate lines. But as we become more global, we've added staff and functions to support that.","But I think if you look at what we have in the plan and even if we're substituting certain comps for others as we grow, I think it's a deal. You can use that as your proxy.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Thank you.","Dylan Jones - Chief Communications Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, everyone. As a reminder, Mike Gallentine will be available for follow-up calls through the rest of the day. I'll now hand it back to the operator for replay information.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 12:15 PM Eastern Time today through midnight Eastern Time on Tuesday, March 8.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Ken.","Kenneth W. Lowe","All right. Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin this morning by saying, as always, we really appreciate your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive.","The company had another in a very long line of positive quarters as our growth story continues without interruption. Underpinning our success is the ubiquitous popularity of our lifestyle television networks in the U.S. and abroad, as well as our industry-leading websites, mobile applications, magazines and array of branded consumer products and venues.","It's very clear that we've created valuable lifestyle destinations, if you will, that attract highly-engaged audiences of food, home and travel enthusiasts, and that those distinctly unique attributes are really what sets Scripps Networks apart from its peers.","The company performed particularly well during the second quarter, with double-digit growth in advertising and distribution revenues; strong viewership at HGTV, DIY and Cooking Channel, positive audience trends at Travel Channel, and the success of popular Food Network programming franchises such as Food Network Star, Mystery Diners and Restaurant: Impossible.","The company's second quarter performance also benefited from a growing contribution from our international businesses, which now includes the Asian Food Channel, which we acquired in April, and rapidly expanding distribution of Food Network and Travel Channel around the globe.","Now looking ahead, we're poised for continued growth, completing another peer-leading advertising upfront this summer with high-single-digit CPM increases and, for the second consecutive year, booking more than $1 billion in business.","On the distribution front, we took a major step forward in joining the industry's TV Everywhere initiative during the second quarter, rolling out a suite of websites and mobile applications across 65% of our distribution base. So that means 65 million authenticated viewers now have access to our popular lifestyle programming across a wide variety of media platforms and devices. Suffice it to say, lots of positive developments and momentum across the entire enterprise.","This is especially true at Travel Channel, where we continue to make progress defining the content genre and creating another lifestyle power brand. During the second quarter, we generated double-digit audience gains on Thursday and Friday nights and mid-single-digit gains on weekends and total day, driven by successful shows like Mysteries at the Museum, Dig Wars, Bizarre Foods America and season #2 of Toy Hunter. The momentum we're creating at Travel is reflected in the strong 14% revenue growth it delivered during the second quarter. Now we'll continue to build on that momentum with a full slate of returning and new programming at Travel in the weeks and months ahead.","In the home category, HGTV had just an outstanding quarter. We set audience records at our original flagship network, with viewership up in the mid-single digits in both prime time and total day. Our creative team at HGTV is really transforming the network with new shows and concepts, and by strengthening and refreshing our most proven programming franchises. Innovative shows such as Renovation Raiders and Flip or Flop are resonating with new and younger viewers, as our new episodes of House Hunters, House Hunters International, Love It Or List It and, of course, Property Brothers.","Now this year's version of HGTV's Star also performed very well, with viewership up an average 11% from last summer. HGTV's durability, as well as its popularity and potential for further growth, is evident, especially as consumer sentiment towards all things home continues to improve.","At Food Network, audience trends improved sequentially during the second quarter, but still lagged behind last year's record levels. The sequential improvement was driven in part by a 10% year-over-year increase in Food Network Star's audience. Now its ninth season, Food Network Star continues to be a dependable performer for us. Other programming successes included Mystery Diners, up almost 20% from the prior season; and Restaurant: Impossible, also up double digits from last year. Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives and Chopped also delivered solid audiences.","Looking ahead, we expect the momentum to continue with the fourth season of The Great Food Truck Race and by leveraging the popular Rachael versus Guy franchise with a kids' cook-off version.","Also, we're going to be premiering some entirely new formats like Food Court Wars and a new vehicle that we're excited about for Alton Brown called Cutthroat Kitchen. And oh, by the way, we just received word that for the second half of the year, Food Network Magazine -- I should say for the first half of the year, Food Network Magazine was the second best-selling title on newsstands. Now that's among all magazines. It's quite a success story and a powerful statement about the strength of the Food Network brand. Now in its 20th year, Food Network is as strong as ever. It continues to shape America's and the world's conversation about food, with certainly much more to come.","Now turning to our flanker brands in the home and food categories, viewership at both DIY Network and Cooking Channel set records with double-digit audience growth. At DIY Network, the list of hits continues growing with new series like Salvage Dogs, Garage Gold and I Hate My Yard. Returning favorites like the Crashers series and Desperate Landscapes also drove audience growth at DIY.","At Cooking Channel, The Freshman Class was the highest-rated launch of a new series in the network's history. And other new shows, like Pizza Cuz, proved to be fan favorites as well.","Strong double-digit revenue growth at DIY and Cooking during the second quarter is proof positive of their value to advertisers, to content distributors and their popularity with media consumers.","Now rounding out our portfolio of lifestyle networks in the U.S. is Great American Country, where our Living Country format is gaining traction. We saw encouraging trends in the second quarter, with viewership among adults aged 25 to 54 up in the double digits and up 30% among women in the demo. Programming standouts for the period included The Willis Clan, which premiered to some very strong ratings, coupled with strong showings from existing titles like Kimberly's Simply Southern and Farm Kings. Great American Country's evolution into a celebration of the best America has to offer continues, so stay tuned.","Internationally, we expanded our footprint with the acquisition of the Asian Food Channel in April. We also expanded in Europe. Food Network and Travel Channel both launched on Virgin Media in the U.K., adding about 2.3 million subscribers. Food Network, we're proud to say, was recently voted as the Best Specialist Channel of 2013 in the U.K. during the annual Freesat Awards. Now, we bested 180 different channels across 10 different genres, quite an accomplishment for a network that's really new to the marketplace.","Food Network, by the way, also launched in Turkey, Norway, Finland and Greece, while at the same time, Travel Channel launched on UPC Direct across Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia. Lots of progress internationally, and certainly more to come.","So there you have it. Scripps Networks Interactive continues to grow, led by the global popularity of all of our lifestyle networks and driven by peer-leading operating results. We're committed to creating value for our shareholders over the long term, a commitment that's borne out of the company's successful track record.","With that, I'll turn it over to Joe to discuss the financial results. Joe?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to touch on some of the second quarter highlights and provide some color on what drove our positive results, then we can open it up for Q&A.","Now starting with the consolidated view, total revenue was up 11% on advertising and affiliate fee revenue growth. Total segment profit was up 12%, which reflects the revenue growth, partially offset by higher programming and international investments. And net income attributable to SNI was $1.08 per share, up 16% compared to last year.","Looking at the key revenue drivers, both advertising and affiliate fees were up 11% versus last year. Advertising revenue growth was driven largely by the strength of the scatter market. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing across the networks was up in the mid- to high-single digits year-over-year, and up in the mid-teens to low-20s over the broadcast upfront.","As for advertising categories, our top 5 were food, retail, auto, financial and consumer packaged goods. And so far in the third quarter, the scatter advertising market continues to be very healthy. Year-over-year, scatter-versus-scatter pricing growth is running in the mid- to high-single digits, and up in the mid- to high-teens over the 2012 broadcast upfront.","As Ken indicated, in the just-completed upfront, we once again finished right at the top of our cable peers, with healthy high-single-digit gains in CPM pricing. Our success in the upfront speaks to the desirability of our lifestyle networks as valued programming and marketing environments, with highly engaged viewers who are passionate about food, home and travel. As has been the case historically, advertisers are willing to pay up for network like ours that can deliver engaged upscale viewers, who are willing to spend discretionary income to buy key goods and services.","Now looking at affiliate revenue growth in the second quarter, the 11% increase was driven by a number of factors, including the annual escalators in our affiliate agreements, a reduction in launch fee amortization, the Amazon digital distribution agreement that we announced at the beginning of the year, and the acquisitions of Asian Food Channel in April of this year and, to a lesser extent, Travel Channel International in April 2012. We expect our quarterly affiliate revenue growth rate to be in the high-single digits for the remainder of 2013.","Now looking at our network performance just in the U.S., revenues were up 9.5% on the strong advertising and affiliate fee growth. Advertising revenues were up 10%, driven by the strong pricing increases I mentioned previously. Affiliate fee revenues were up 9.5%, which were positively impacted by the reduction in the launch fee amortization and the Amazon digital distribution deal.","Total segment expenses were up 6.6% on higher programming costs, and as a result, segment profit was up 12% from the prior-year period. Our international businesses generated $16 million of revenue that was included in our second quarter consolidated results. This was up considerably from the prior year, primarily due to the previously-mentioned acquisitions. We also generated $25 million of equity in earnings of affiliates, up from $21 million last year, with about half coming from our international partnerships in Canada and UKTV in the United Kingdom.","Now turning to the balance sheet, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of our own stock during the second quarter at an average price of $67.71 a share, for a total expenditure of around $100 million. We ended the second quarter with $347 million in cash, including $160 million we generated from operating activities during the period.","Finally, we've updated full year 2013 guidance as follows. Due to the ongoing strength in the advertising market, total revenue is now expected to increase between 9% and 10%. That's up from the previous range of 7% to 9%. And as a result of the Asian Food Channel acquisition and other international investments, our selling, general and administrative expenses are now expected to increase somewhere between 9% and 11%. The previous range was 7% to 9%.","And for the sake of completeness, the company reiterated all its other guidance ranges. Cost of services are expected to increase between 12% and 14%; depreciation and amortization, between $115 million to $125 million; interest expense will be between $50 million and $55 million; our effective tax rate will be between 28% and 30%; noncontrolling share of net income will be between $175 million and $185 million; and our capital expenditures will end somewhere between $65 million and $70 million for the year.","And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Townsend Buckles - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Townsend Buckles for Alexia with a few questions. First, looking at your guidance with a bit of moderation in growth still implied in the back half of the year, it sounds like advertising is pacing a bit stronger than expected -- than you expected earlier in the year. So are there other offsets we should keep in mind?","Joseph G. NeCastro","I'll take that, Townsend. No, there's nothing you should concern yourself about. I think we -- obviously, we project with some caution. There are things we don't know yet. But we feel confident about it.","Townsend Buckles - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Do you see advertising growth continuing at about double digits ahead, or slowing somewhat?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Well, I think the guidance we gave today gives you the numbers.","Townsend Buckles - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then just lastly, if you could talk about how you see profitability progressing at your international networks as you continue to develop them?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Well, certainly, look. I think the international operations for us are one of our most important investment opportunities for the company, and we're going to continue to invest where we see opportunities. We obviously take a longer-term view of that avenue for growth and that opportunity to build value, so we're going to -- we'll invest where it's appropriate. I think in the markets where we achieved scale, we certainly expect to turn profitable. But overall, we're going to continue to invest wherever we think there's an attractive return available.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","With regard to the ratings at Food Network, I mean, you talked about Food Network Star being up 10% year-over-year; Mystery Diners, up 20%, Restaurant: Impossible was up double digits, Triple D was positive growth. What's been the drag on the performance? And as you get into August now, where your comparison should be a lot easier, does some of those tough comparisons go away?","John F. Lansing","Yes, Eric, this is John. I'll take that. You're absolutely right. The comps for Food Network ratings will ease as we move forward through August and into the fourth quarter. You point out the strength of certain programs. The reality is, in the first quarter and into the beginning of the second quarter, we were pacing against unusually successful and high ratings from the prior year. And notwithstanding some of the drag there, we were still turning in the second or third highest quarter in the history of the network. And as we moved into June, we saw the declines move from mid-teens to high singles. And into July, they moderated even some more, and I fully expect to see us begin to move into the positive territory in year-over-year comps coming up in the next month or 2, looking forward.","Operator","We have a question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Hersh Khadilkar - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Hersh Khadilkar on for Ben. Just a couple of quick questions. Year-to-date, your cash spend on programming was down. Regarding the expectation that you guys may have indicated earlier that, for the year, it should be up, can you give us a sense in terms of how we should think about that for the rest of the year? And then just to follow up, on your international investments, you've been pretty active expanding your footprint. Are there any particular kind of markets you're focused on going forward?","Joseph G. NeCastro","I'll let Lori take first part of that, and I'll come back on the international.","Lori A. Hickok","Really, there's really no change in our view of cash spending for the year. It's just more of a timing. It's probably got more of the cash coming in, in the back half compared with last year, which really ties with development schedules and the timing of premieres. We've got a lot more premieres in the back half, as we were counterprogramming the Olympics last year. So a lot of that has to do with really just timing. But spending is really in line, for full year, with our expectations.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Okay, great. On the international side, look, I think we have talked before on these calls about our -- the markets that we think are really attractive to us. Ken mentioned some of the Eastern European markets, where we're seeing enhanced distribution for Travel Channel, and our areas of focus continue to be sort of Central, Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America. And part of the reason for some of the accelerated spending is we are going deeper into each of those areas of the world, and we're going to continue to invest there.","Operator","Our next question is from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.","Dave Beckel","This is Dave Beckel for Todd. With regard to U.S. affiliate revenue, can you comment on to what extent SVOD affected the overall growth rate this quarter? And excluding SVOD and lower amortization, did the core affiliate growth rate accelerate or decelerate this quarter? And as a quick follow-up, there's been some industry interest on whether or not subscriber accounts in general have changed to the downside this quarter. Have you seen any sort of noteworthy change in your subscriber accounts across your U.S. footprint?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Dave, I'll take the first part of that. I think the impact of SVOD and the amortization were, I wouldn't say negligible, but they were positive obviously. But without them, we did not see any kind of deceleration in the growth rate there. It's, in fact, fairly steady for the year. John, you want to talk about the universe?","John F. Lansing","A quick answer on the universe estimates, we have held fairly steady throughout the first half of the year, nothing notable there at all.","Operator","Our next question is from Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","My question, I think, is for Ken. So, Ken, I think everyone agrees with you on the attractiveness of the business model, and the revenue growth trajectory is a testament of that and the margins. There are some peers that have much lower rate -- advertising revenue growth rates, gross margins. Do you think that the competition in your category, because of the attractiveness of your business model, is going to be intensifying further from here? And if so, where do you expect it to come? Whom are you watching, keeping an eye on? Is it broadcast networks, general entertainment or new launches of targeted networks? So I would be interested in your view from this big-picture point.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Sure, Vasily. Well, thank you. I think our business model over the years has proven to be very durable, very sturdy. And the advertising component, which is how these networks were put together from day one and that has a close association with our advertising partners, working hand in hand with them beyond just 30s and 60s across all platforms and trying to stay ahead a little bit, if you will, of the advertising trends, has served us very well. And I think it's why we over-index on the advertising side. Of course, it doesn't hurt to deliver a very quality audience of upscale women, which we have targeted also from day one. Regarding competition, we've said on these calls before, we've enjoyed our share of competition in all our categories for some time now. And we see that ebb and flow. It depends on different dayparts. It depends on different channels. The food category has certainly seen an influx of a lot of competition over the last several years, primarily due to the success of the Food Network. To your point, we have seen it move beyond cable networks onto the broadcast platform, but I think it's just indicative, Vasily, of how popular these categories are. And if you look at how well we're doing in the home category now, with both HGTV and DIY, and the advertising around that category, it's not surprising that we see competition. But the important thing, I think, is that we have these unique brands that people come to consistently. So competition is going to pop up. That's the nature of the game. We operate in a very creative, cannibalistic environment, and that's just been the nature of it. But I see nothing but positive trends ahead. And I think as we've seen competition come and go, we'll see more of that. But to your point, the model is very sturdy, and we're seeing the popularity of the model, as Joe talked about, also in our international expansion. So competition is going to continue, and we think we're in a good position. But again, if I could just emphasize, the quality of the brands and the focus of these brands, where people can come 24\/7 and know they'll always get food programming, always home programming, always travel programming, in my opinion, that's going to continue to serve us well regardless on what platform people will be accessing them.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Morris with Davenport & Company.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. One, Ken, you mentioned the increasing popularity of all things home and home improvement at this point. Can you talk a little more, maybe revisit the topic of how that can positively impact you? And what I'm thinking is, I understand how it can improve ratings if the public is more interested. But does it also give you an additional tailwind on the advertising side? Do you see an increase in endemic advertisers? Did more come in during the upfront, and do they pay more? And then second, Joe, I'll ask the question. Any update on the Food Network stake buy-in? But maybe just to go a little further, we keep waiting it seems, sort of an indefinite time frame. You guys haven't used as much leverage as some of your peers. Interest rates are going up. At what point do you have to be more assertive in either pushing the issue or making the decision to use your balance sheet otherwise?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes. Mike, let me address your question around advertising, because you're right, there's no question, the improvement in the housing market that we're seeing, and it certainly is very strong now and I'm sure, like us, you saw the most recent housing numbers, pricing. Market is pretty tight right now. I've been going to the International Home Builder's Show now for almost 20 years. And when the market's healthy, there are more vendors there and there are more people selling things. And guess what, consumers are paying more attention to their home, both inside and outside. We realized quite a few years ago that there were certain endemic advertisers, especially advertisers that sold special products, it might be just one product that goes in your garage or something to use outside, would not maybe be able to step up to the level of an HGTV CPM, and that's why we created DIY, both to take advantage of additional endemic advertisers and also, in some cases, go for a little -- a little bit more towards the specialty home market. So it's a long-winded way of saying, absolutely, we benefit when the market is healthy. When Lowe's and Home Depot and the home improvement guys are doing better, it just makes for a better marketplace. Having said all of that, the endemic advertising, while a critical part, really, if you look at our categories in the second quarter, the top 3 were food, retail, auto, and financial was #4. Home improvement was actually #6 overall. So while it benefits us, it's a positive, we'd love to see a healthy home market, we're now diversified enough that we're not as dependent on it as we were, say, 10 years ago. Joe?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes, Mike, on the Tribune question. Certainly, it's -- all of you -- it's not lost on investors what's happening at Tribune there. Their strategy is obviously becoming very clear as they move aggressively to build a very large broadcasting platform. Certainly, they made some aggressive moves, they're going to separate out newspapers and they've made some purchases, and I think they continue to be active. It certainly makes sense to us that, at some point, as they rationalize their portfolio and move toward a more pure-play broadcast enterprise, that their minority investments are something that they could use to fund their ambitions. That said, there's obviously one buyer for that asset, and we knew we're not going to overpay for it. And I think everybody understands that. They know that we're here. We meet with them quarterly, if not more frequently than that. And like I say, we're not going to do anything overly aggressive to overpay for that piece of the Food Network. We have a number of opportunities available to the company, and we prefer the flexibility that a little bit lower leverage provides for us. We are keenly aware of the benefits of increased leverage. We just want to make sure we're using it most appropriately. So we'll continue to be here and patient about it, but we do believe ultimately that's something that will happen.","Operator","We have a question from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wondering, if you take this Food Network ratings question a step further, is there a way for you -- and maybe it's a question for John, to find the possible upside to monetization from recovering the Food Network ratings? Maybe said another way, have there been make-goods that will go away, that would possibly mitigate the impact of the Food Network's ratings question? And then second question, maybe just for Lori, I think you said that cash programming expense for the year remains in line. Have you shifted? I mean, when you guys talked about the new formats of Food Network, have you...","[Audio Gap]","Lori A. Hickok","Uh-oh.","John F. Lansing","Anthony [indiscernible]?","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","network for another?","Lori A. Hickok","Anthony, we're losing you.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Anthony, you're cutting out. Sorry. Why don't we work on the first question? And then hopefully, your line will clear up.","John F. Lansing","Yes, Anthony, this is John. Can you hear me?","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I can hear you.","John F. Lansing","Okay. Listen, we made some adjustments going into the year on our advertising guarantees so that we weren't digging a deep hole there and that fortunately, we haven't. And therefore, I think, as ratings -- we continue to moderate and move into positive territory, they won't be that far out of line with our original estimates. And they'll -- the revenue, as our forecast indicates, is driven, in large part, by HGTV and Food. And so you can see the number buried within there, is just about right based on the ratings delivery that we see going forward.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then if you can still hear me, my second question was just -- you mentioned the new formats on Food Network. Have you guys taken any programming expense on, let's say, HG, or maybe your smaller networks and allocated them or reallocated them to Food Network as a way to support the network and its shows and ratings during that period of these tough comps? Have you done that just for...","Lori A. Hickok","No, we have not.","Operator","We'll go next to Amy Yong with Macquarie.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Research","Can you just provide some more detail on your strategy on the international front? Is it just blocking and tackling at this point? Can you also talk about your appetite to do something larger on the M&A front, or if you're looking just for smaller tuck-in deals?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Sure. Amy, this is Joe. We certainly have spent a lot of time talking about our international strategy. I think, at this point, we are working very hard to execute the integration and the expansion of the Travel Channel International and now, certainly, of the Asian Food Channel and along with the sort of organic growth of the existing networks in new territories. As you know, we've been active. They've tended to be smaller deals, but things that fit very, very well with the portfolio and with our management structure and team. We do have an appetite to do something bigger, we would love to, but we're going to be disciplined about things that we think fit within the portfolio and that might provide a good return for our shareholders. As you know, there's been a lot of enthusiasm around certain of these assets and these acquisitions. Prices have certainly crept up. So we'll be -- obviously, we'll be disciplined and we'll be careful. We think we have a lot of capacity to do things and a lot of grow room ahead of us. So we'll -- we're going to look at everything, continue to be active.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi with S&P IQ.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","So, Ken, I wanted to get your quick take on the a la carte topic. With all the noise going on out there in terms of programming costs, it seems to me that you guys would be -- are very well positioned in such a scenario, however remote that might seem, so any kind of thoughts there would be helpful. And separately, with regard to the TV Everywhere deals that you seem like you're finally ramping up, I was just trying to get a sense, where do you feel you're getting the most value for these deals, especially now that you seem to be getting critical mass? Where are you getting the most monetization for those kinds of rights? And I also wanted to clarify if it was primarily in-home viewing? Or did you -- also kind of making deals for out-of-home and how you see those kind of dynamics playing out. That will be helpful.","Kenneth W. Lowe","All right. All right, Tuna. Regarding a la carte, I think you've put your finger on it, it's a very remote possibility at this point. It's not something that I think is anywhere near in the future, even though it's a little bit in the news these days. But it really gives me a chance to just underscore the value of the video package. And you've heard it many times, it's a great package. I mean, when you look at the value, the number of the networks you're getting, the diversity of the networks you're getting, at the end of the day, the American consumer would not be well served by an a la carte environment. And quite frankly, we don't think that's on the horizon any time soon. As far as the TV Everywhere deals, Tuna, it's early. What we're really doing is continuing to work with our distribution partners on what we think will be the continuing future, this very strong economic model that we benefited from for a number of years. And as measurement, it's more precise and better on all these different platforms that will allow us to continue to perpetuate this model on the different platforms and different devices. And in our case, we think there's some real upside, because the more specificity and the more targeting that we can do for advertisers to the end consumer, with additional information and data, we're pretty excited about the TV Everywhere model. And I think at the end of the day, that's why you'll see this partnership between content folks, like us, and our distribution partners continue for a long time. It benefits everyone, and it's still, hands-down, the best advertising model, and will be for the foreseeable future.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","Do you feel that being -- indexing really high, you have your in-line viewing, as you've alluded to in the past, is pretty at the top of the heap. Is that some -- is that a factor as you think about some of the issues you alluded to, whether it's kind of measurement or monetization, or even the kind of shows that you would put on?","Kenneth W. Lowe","A bit all of the above. Because if you -- if you can take our programming with you anywhere, you can take it to the grocery store if you're shopping your recipe list you got from the Food Network, whether it's a mobile device, whatever, if you can take it to your home improvement store and we can geo target you there in-store, couponing, whatever that could be in your smartphone, like I said, we're pretty bullish on all of this. There's going to be, as there always is, a few bumps in the road as we transition to these other platforms. But we own all of our content. It has tremendous engagement. And as you've heard us say many times, Tuna, we have the highest engagement of all content providers among cable networks. So that engagement, I think, bodes very well for, \"taking our content\" in any room in the house and, of course, out of the house as well. So all in all, we're very bullish about the TV Everywhere partnership and the benefits it can reap for both sides.","Operator","And our final question comes from Ben Mogil with Stifel.","Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask you a little bit about the SVOD. I'm not sure how much Amazon is sharing with you in terms of where people -- what people are watching. But if they are, any sort of surprises there? I know that Lionsgate has mentioned in the past that they think that some of the shows that have gone onto SVOD have kind of had a new life, and AMC is seeing the same thing. And I'm wondering if you're sort of seeing some shows that were having some trouble on network, possibly using SVOD to sort of reinvigorate them?","John F. Lansing","Yes, Ben, this is John. We -- it's really early days for us with Amazon in terms of that, and we're really seeing nothing that's popping out as a unique offering. Of course, our networks are a little different than general entertainment networks that may be driven by 1 or 2 hit series. Ours tend to be driven by brands, a number of series that drive the brand. And I think people, when they go to Amazon for our content, are really going for the brand and not an individual show.","Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then if you look out abroad, any expectations that you can get an SVOD deal done with some of your international channels?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Sure. I mean, there are discussions underway in a lot of these distribution deals to whether or not there are alternatives available. Certainly, part of the Amazon deal is international deal -- calling for international distribution as well. So there are opportunities, and we continue to explore them.","Mark W. Kroeger","All right. This is Mark. Thanks, everybody. Mike and I are available for the rest of the day for follow-ups. Operator, you can give the replay instructions.","Operator","Certainly.

Lowe","All right, Mark, thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. As always, we appreciate your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. This is a company that's had 20 years of growth and that long-term track record of success continued uninterrupted during the first quarter. Our peer-leading operating results during the 3-month period included double-digit growth in advertising revenue, double-digit growth in distribution revenues, a growing contribution from our international businesses and partnerships and here in the beginning of the second quarter, the addition of an exciting new food channel in Asia that reaches some of the fastest growing markets in the world.","It's an impressive litany of positive developments and they're all driven by the ubiquitous popularity of our lifestyle television networks and the distinctive competitive advantage that they command.","Without a doubt, our networks are highly valued marketing platforms that media consumers, advertisers and content distributors demand. Our network group is #1 with 94% in-live viewing, a remarkable number. We're #1 for aggregating upscale audiences. And we're #1 for ad receptivity and inspiring our viewers to learn about and try new products. Now these attributes separate us from the pack and they drive our consistently solid operating results.","We deliver on our promise to create value for our shareholders by staying true to our formula for success that's proven time and again to be remarkably durable. Our television networks, websites and apps are leaders in their respective content categories because of our determination to stay on brand, our determination to stay focused on consumer interest in all things home, in all things food and in all things travel.","Now in the Home category, our networks are basking in the glow of a reviving housing and real estate market. Consumers are feeling better about their homes and they're turning to HGTV and DIY Network for ideas, information and inspiration. HGTV attracted record audiences during the first quarter with viewership among adults 25 to 54 in the high-single digits in both primetime and total day. On weekends, audience gains were even stronger, up in the double digits. New episodes of House Hunters and House Hunters International, Love It Or List It and Property Brothers appeal to a growing number of viewers as did new titles like Hawaii Life and Flea Market Flip.","Now we'll keep the momentum going in the weeks ahead with a full slate of entertaining new series and this year's addition of HGTV Star, which is always a fan favorite for us. At DIY Network, we continue to define home improvement television, with shows like The Vanilla Ice Project, Rehab Addict and Rescue My Renovation. And audiences have responded in kind.","Viewership at DIY was up in the double digits during the quarter and we set audience records at every major daypart. It's clear that our Home category television networks are perfectly positioned to capitalize on the housing recovery.","Now over Travel Channel, our investment in quality original programming is paying off. Travel Channel has delivered 8 consecutive months of year-over-year audience growth with March tying as the network's highest rated month ever for all demos.","During the quarter, Travel Channel registered double-digit audience gains in the important primetime daypart. And even more promising, the gains were driven by female viewers, a demographic that as you know, is highly valued by advertisers. The popularity of returning series like Bizarre Foods America, Mysteries at of the Museum, Hotel Impossible and Baggage Battles are driving this growth, affirming for us that we're on the right track and defining the travel content genre for television and in building the brand.","Now looking ahead, watch for new episodes of other successful series that we've introduced including Airport 24\/7: Miami, Trip Flip and Toy Hunter. And there'll also be some new offerings as well, including one starring legendary rocker, Bret Michaels, that's already getting lots of buzz. Brett now, as it turns out, is an RV aficionado of the top order and he's going to be sharing his passion with viewers by transforming their ordinary RVs into mobile mansions. We call it Rock My RV with Bret Michaels. It's coming soon. Be watching for it.","And we're delivering on our promise to create value at Travel Channel and we're very excited about the progress being made there.","Over in the Food category, we're celebrating Food Network's 20th anniversary and the success that we've had establishing a pop-culture icon. We help shape a nation and, increasingly, the world's conversation about food by defining the genre for television and providing the platform for some of the world's most recognized celebrity chefs and high-profile food personalities.","It's an amazing story, really, that's driven a niche channel into direct competition with the top ranked television networks of our day. During the first quarter, audience trends improved as we introduced new series of Rachael vs. Guy Celebrity Cook-Off and Worst Cooks in America, featuring Anne Burrell and Bobby Flay. Also contributing were new seasons of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, Chopped, Restaurant Stakeout and Restaurant: Impossible, a pantheon of hit shows that efficiently drive viewership.","Next up, the perennial performers like Chopped All-Stars, Iron Chef America Tournament of Champions and the ninth season of Food Network Star, as well as some new concepts that we'll be premiering. And one of our new shows, an unsuspecting hard-working fast food employee will win their own restaurant franchise. It's a hidden camera challenge format we call, Giving You the Business. And in another new show called The Shed, we'll follow the antics of a Mississippi family who made a fortune and a name for themselves in the barbecue restaurant business. In other words, we're taking the Food Network to new heights and in new directions as we leverage our 24\/7 ownership of this popular television genre that we define. And we're doing the same at our flanker brand in the Food category.","At Cooking Channel, total day audience continued to grow during in the first quarter and popularity of shows like Not My Mama's Meals with Bobby Dean and such fan favorites as Extra Virgin, Dinner: Impossible and Throwdown With Bobby Flay. We're giving Cooking Channel a personality, really, all of its own by allocating a fair amount of original programming to the network balanced with popular archived content from the mothership. The successful formula has followed -- has allowed us to further capitalize on the tremendous popularity of food as a content genre.","Now at Great American Country, our Living Country lifestyle format is beginning to find its audience. Most promising was an increase in viewership among women during the first quarter on the strength of original programming like Kimberly's Simply Southern and Wynonna and Cactus, The Road Back. Now some of the programming from our library like Paula's Home Cooking and Truck Stop USA is also resonating with GAC viewers. The positive viewing trends are encouraging and they're reflected in the network's improved performance during the first quarter.","Internationally, we continued to grow with our acquisition last month of the Asian Food Channel. Based in Singapore, AFC is the region's leading food-focused pay television network with 8 million paid subscribers in 11 markets. In addition to our portfolio significantly expanding our presence -- its addition, I should say, to our portfolio significantly expands our presence in key growth markets and it really gives us a tow haul in the region that we can build upon.","AFC aligns perfectly with our lifestyle programming focus and along with Travel Channel and Food Network, it gives us 3 strong brands that we're marketing in the region.","So there you have it. Strong first quarter operating results driven by [indiscernible] advertising growth. We're delighting and engaging audiences in the U.S. and across the globe with our brand of lifestyle content. And we're delivering on our promise to create value for our shareholders over the long term.","Now with that, let me turn it over to Joe NeCastro to discuss the financial results. Joe?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to touch on some of the first quarter highlights and then provide some color on what drove our positive results. At the end, we'll open it up for Q&A.","Looking at the quarter and starting with the consolidated view, total revenue was up 11% on advertising and affiliate fee revenue growth. Total segment profit was up 3.4%, which reflects the revenue growth offset by the higher programming and support costs.","Now let me emphasize that the cost growth for the year is more heavily weighted to the first quarter in part due to the timing of certain equity compensation awards and to the headcount that was added during 2012. The other sizable item contributing to the higher level of expenses during the quarter was programming amortization, which was up 15%. This reflects the cash investment we've made in prior periods to drive viewership of Travel Channel and our other flagship brands.","The good news is that the first quarter rate of growth moderated year-over-year, down from 23% in 2012. Programming costs in 2013, while they'll be lumpy, are expected to fall within the guidance we provided, as will non-programming expenses.","Also contributing to the expense growth in the first quarter and included in our full year guidance, are the company's initiatives to expand globally and to leverage growing consumer and advertiser demand for digital video platforms. We debuted one of those initiatives during our upfront presentations this spring. We're calling it uLIVE and it's receiving a very warm reception from advertisers.","","Internationally, keep in mind that the first quarter expenses also include Travel Channel International, which wasn't part of our portfolio until the end of April last year. International expense growth also includes products related to our buildout of regional hubs in London, Singapore and Rio de Janeiro as we target expansion into key global growth markets.","We believe these are wise investments in the Lifestyle Media businesses that will generate positive returns for our shareholders over the long term.","Now turning to net income for the first quarter, net income attributable to SNI was $0.72 per share compared with $0.73 in the first quarter of last year. Included in the first quarter of 2013 were unfavorable tax adjustments totaling $8 million or $0.05 a share. This reflects the net impact from the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the resolution of open income tax items from prior periods.","Looking at the key revenue drivers for the quarter, we finished with strong advertising and affiliate fee revenues, both up 11% last year. As for the U.S. advertising trends, we saw a strengthening of the scatter market during the quarter. The first quarter scatter versus scatter pricing was up in the mid- to high-single digits year-over-year and up in the mid to high teens over the broadcast upfront. As for advertising categories, our top 5 were food, retail, financial, consumer packaged goods and auto.","In the quarter, the big movers were the financial and retail segments. Financial increased nearly 30% from last year's first quarter, while retail was up over 30%. Financial, in fact, moved up to #3 on our rankings.","So far, in the second quarter, the scatter advertising market continues to be healthy. Year-over-year, scatter versus scatter pricing growth is currently running in the mid- to high-single digits and up in the mid to high teens over the 2012 broadcast upfront.","The 11% increase in affiliate fee revenue in the first quarter reflects the impact from the Amazon digital distribution agreement that we announced at the beginning of the year. Also impacting the first quarter 2013 growth rate was the acquisition of Travel Channel International at the end of April 2012. Going forward, we expect our quarterly affiliate revenue growth rate to be in the mid- to high-single digits for the remainder of 2013.","Now let's take a look at how our networks did in the U.S. during the first quarter. Revenues were up 10% on strong advertising and affiliate fee growth. Advertising revenues were also up 10% in the quarter, driven by the pricing increases I previously mentioned. Affiliate fee revenues were up 8.5% which were positively impacted by the Amazon deal I mentioned above.","Total segment costs were up 13% on higher programming and support costs. As a result, segment profit was up 6.6% from the prior-year period.","Turning to our international business, we generated $12 million of revenue that was included in our first quarter consolidated results. This was up considerably from the prior year, again, primarily due to the Travel Channel International acquisition. The largest components of our international revenue were distribution fees and advertising. Our program licensing business comprised the remainder. We also generated $20.6 million of equity in earnings of affiliates, up from $13.9 million last year. Driving more than half of this was generated from our international partnerships in Canada and from UKTV in the United Kingdom.","During the first quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million shares of our own stock at an average price of $62.62 a share, with total expenditure of around $150 million. We ended the first quarter with $421 million in cash, including the $268 million we generated from operating activities in the first quarter.","And finally, there's no change in our previously issued full year 2013 guidance at this time.","And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from John Janedis with UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","2 questions. First, John, just on the slide deck, it shows the improving scatter pricing trends. Should we assume 3Q options are pretty light and that some scatter money may get pulled into the upfront given the strength of the market? And separately, for Joe, just on uLIVE, can you talk a little bit more about the opportunity? With the exclusivity around the Amazon prime deal, how much of your content can you put up on the site? And are you selling it alongside of the networks in the upfront?","John F. Lansing","Yes, John, I'll start. Your assumptions are correct. We're very low in terms of options on Q3. Pricing continues to look strong, as Joe just mentioned. And we anticipate that to continue. And I think that will have a favorable effect on our upfront negotiations. Joe, why don't you go ahead and talk about uLIVE and Amazon?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Sure. Well, uLIVE, as you know, is an extension of our digital video strategy. Really, what it allows us to do is to give scale to expand our existing video strategy online on our own sites. And it lets us expand to not only the uLIVE site, but to affiliated sites all over the web in our categories. That's a separate strategy from affiliating with Amazon, for example, where we're taking existing library content and just monetizing it through that one particular business model.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions, I guess, we have one and a follow-up, right? With the upfront presentation behind you and a sense of a programming lineup looks like for next season. And I know you honestly programmed for the season but you're about to sell on the upfront. Do you have increased visibility on the programming cost growth curve looking forward beyond this year?","John F. Lansing","Well, Doug, as you know, it's a very competitive marketplace right now in terms of lots of networks doing very, very well and ratings improving all over the dial, including our own. And that will have an effect on program pricing. We don't have a -- I don't think we can put a percentage growth in terms of beyond this year and what we're forecasting for this year. But we, as you know, are well-known in the industry for having the lowest cost per hour for our programming. And the fact that we own our programming for the most part, over 90% of it we own, allows us to monetize it beyond the linear exploitation of it as we were discussing earlier through these other windows, through a window with Amazon and, ultimately, through our own digital strategy. So we have a better monetization scheme. But overall, the price of programming certainly is not going down, but we're going to work hard to moderate it as much as we can.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And maybe if I asked it better. Is the amount of original programming hours going up by a percentage that you could share?","John F. Lansing","No. I mean, we're producing roughly the same number of hours now that we've normalized the hours on Travel Channel year-over-year. We may have a small, very small growth in numbers of hours because of our increase on GAC, but that's really not material. But in the scheme of things over the entire company, I'd say our number of hours will be roughly the same year-over-year.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Very helpful. And then just in terms of your experience historically. What does mid to high teens scatter pricing translate to in terms of the upfront? I mean, I'd say over time, I would typically see that kind of price increase translate into mid- to high-single digit in the upfront. But do you have a -- what would your experience tell you?","John F. Lansing","My experience would tell me not to speculate about the upfront.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Eric Handler with MKM Partners","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Looking at your corporate expense line, wonder if you could sort of break out your corporate overhead versus the investments that you're making with a number of the initiatives that you have going on? And how should we think about that going forward?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes. Eric, this is Joe. Look, I think we have sort of avoided being too granular on that line. That's the line that includes the investment activity in the digital space primarily and some international spending, as well, in addition to corporate overhead. The way we think about it is we target very low growth in the corporate overhead piece and then we try and give you a sense typically for how much we're going to spend on the other initiatives. And last year, we targeted a number for the other initiatives of around $30 million in spending. I'd say that number will be in the same ZIP code, up slightly year-on-year. And corporate expenses are going to grow very modestly. And I think that's our target going forward, to target a sort of over to the 0% to 3% growth in corporate overheads and focus our resources on either programming or new initiatives that we think will generate positive returns.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","And is there a point in time where some of those -- the other -- the digital initiatives or the international spending, we start seeing a slowing there? Or is that going to be pretty steady throughout the year?","Joseph G. NeCastro","I think it will be a little bit lumpy during the year. But I'd say generally speaking, we're going to be at this rate. We're going to be in this area. I think the guidance we've given is still very, very relevant and we're not going to change it. I do think year on -- there's some things we're doing this year, I would say, that I would not expect to recur. So I'm expecting some of that to moderate. But in terms of the core corporate stuff, no, I think that's going to be pretty steady.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Michael Nathanson with Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have one housekeeping for Joe and then one for Ken. Joe, the question is how did you guys spread the digital money for Amazon across your operating revenues per brand? So was it all in one brand? I mean, how do you -- how do we look at your operating revenues, I'm thinking, for the digital money?","Joseph G. NeCastro","I'm going to let Lori take that.","Lori A. Hickok","Really, we're spreading it across all the brands because we're providing content across, but what I would point out is that we also have refresh. We're going to be providing content throughout the life of the contracts, so you're going to see that continue on throughout the course of that. But it's not one brand only. Obviously, big shows like on HGTV and Food might be getting a disproportionate amount of that. But it's sitting in our numbers and it really depends on where the views are and what titles they're monetizing.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. So it's really the -- it was the mission of the bigger brands because -- over-indexed to that?","Lori A. Hickok","Yes.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then Ken and John, I wonder, given how  badly broadcast ratings were in the first quarter, I'm looking at the growth of some of your smaller channels like Travel, DIY, Cooking. Are you seeing a new type of advertiser heretofore coming to you because they can't find inventory? And where are the spot rates on some of your smaller networks versus maybe the more traditional bigger networks you have? So can you talk a bit about where the money is coming from?","John F. Lansing","Yes. We'll tag-team it a little bit, Michael. As we've talked many times, these flanker brands benefit so greatly by being flanker brands. As you heard us say in the past, just about out of the box, the Cooking Channel is doing 75% of the CPMs that we were getting on the Food Network. So yes, there's some spillover of endemic, but to your point, we are finding some specific advertisers -- DIY is a great example because we've had that network up and running since 1999 -- where maybe some of the advertisers who don't have big enough budgets to do an HGTV buy will very selectively and smartly buy into DIY. And that gives us some additional money in the marketplace that we're not having to play with across all of our brands in the normal categories. And we're starting to see that on the Cooking Channel, as well. And we expect to see that with GAC as we convert that more to a Living Country format over time. So I think when you look at our results, our advertising results then again for the quarter, we expect to be at the top of the peer group. It's that kind of additive feature that these flanker brands give us. Now as far as the broadcast networks, I don't know, John, if you want to comment about some of the changes going on there. I don't think there's a lot necessarily.","John F. Lansing","No, I'll just add to the points Ken made. The Travel Channel opens up more male category advertisers to us. And that's new to us and that's a lucrative area for presenting high-quality male demographics that are non-sports, nonnews. Travel Channel is really opening that up for us. And then on the other side, along with Cooking and DIY, is our ability to converge digital with these smaller networks to bring first to time to television advertisers into our fold here. And so the combination of bringing them in through the digital door, if you will, and then up converting them into TV advertisers has been a real success story for us.","Kenneth W. Lowe","And then, Michael, maybe just to summarize this and, actually, I guess the conversation I had with you the last time. I saw -- as we see the broadcast networks continue to shrink a little bit, if you will, it's becoming more and more apparent that the quality of the audience and the targeted nature of the audience, the psychographics and demographics, are becoming even more important and biased to advertisers, the environment that they're putting their spots into. So I think as the cable networks continue to, on many nights, battle of broadcast networks for leadership and ratings, you're going to see quality of audiences continue to kind of rise to the top. And that's why we've been where we are and that's why we tried to stay on brands here for a number of years.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You used to have such an incredible success at the Cooking Channel with the ratings doing particularly well. Is there any concern that maybe there is some migration of audience there, which is contributing to some of this more soft performance you're seeing at Food?","Kenneth W. Lowe","It's a great question. It's a logical question, Alexia. As you might guess, we've looked at that very closely. And the reality is the -- as well as Cooking Channel is doing on its subscriber base, a movement of 8%, 9% and 10% on Cooking Channel would really be non-material even if it all came from Food Network. Considering on any given night, Food Network might have 1 million viewers in the demo and Cooking Channel would have something like 50,000 to 80,000 perhaps. So while it seems logical that there'd be an erosion one to the other, we think of it more as a protection, as a defensive stalwart to protect our leadership in the Food category completely, both against an incoming 24\/7 competitor, which we don't believe one would now show up, and in terms of owning the category or advertising as well. So all in all, no migration significant or measurable.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just a follow-up on GAC. Sort of another success story there where you made a change in programming that really transformed the network. Any sense there where you think, I guess, what inning you're in, in that sort of transformation, how much further can we see that improve?","Kenneth W. Lowe","It's top of the first with one out. No, I -- listen, we are just getting started. We don't want a knee jerk and create an audience, a head snap, if you will. There's still a significant audience in that world, if you will, for the country music. And so we want to evolve and not revolutionize the network and carry it along. And particularly not just for the audience, which always comes first, but also on the expense side. We want to be very prudent on the investment in programming. We want to use our library wisely, use cross promotion wisely and move it along quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year. And we're really pleased with the progress we're making.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. The first is, if I kind of parse your commentary around the digital expenses kind of keeping a run rate around where they were at $30 million. If you look at 2012, you were kind of building uLIVE with absolutely no revenue and building out City Eats. You kind of move into this year, uLIVE is kind of up and running by the fall, it looks like, and starting to generate revenue. The expense level may be stable for the next couple of years, but how should we think about the profitability, particularly of uLIVE, if you look at that $30 million loss drag? And how do we think about the next couple of years where that loss becomes 100% offset by revenue and ultimately start to make a profit? And the second totally unrelated part of the question is, if I look ahead to 2015 as kind of an outsider, it seems to me that your affiliates fees are still really massively under-indexed versus your audience levels, your advertising levels. And I think there's some -- after having come to such a massive affiliate step-up in the last cycle, people wonder, even though you arguably deserve on that index basis, a pretty big affiliate step-up, do you think you could pull off the same kind of magnitude of the increases this time? That's my second part of the question.","Kenneth W. Lowe","So David, I'll take the first part, but I will comment on the second part. Would you like to join us on our next [indiscernible]?","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'd be happy to be in the room.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes. On digital expenses, first, just a clarification. The $30 million that was drawn around last year was losses including international as well. So -- but back to digital, specifically from a minute. Look, without forecasting when these initiatives will get to breakeven, we certainly feel like it'll be in the not-too-distant future. But these are longer-term investments. We believe there's a big market in video we want to play. So we are working hard to get that product in the market. There will be continuing spending as we build it out, build the capability and build that network as we talked about, and also build a portal for that. But we do expect the revenue to continue to track positively. As I said, advertisers are excited about it. And certainly, it won't be 10 years from now before it breaks even. So it's a short-term proposition, but we think it's only that we want to do for advertisers, ultimately, then for shareholders. And C3, it's a similar, and in fact, that market continues to evolve. Our proposition will evolve, but we do think playing in restaurants is really an important place for us to be and we'll invest for a couple of years. But again, it's not going to go so deep that we don't get that back to a cumulative breakeven in the near term.","John F. Lansing","And then I'll take the affiliate question. I appreciate your tone on the question as well. The answer is that we do believe there's a significant upside growth, notwithstanding the headwinds and the rising cost of programming overall. We believe there will need to be somewhat of maybe a share shift in some networks that are underperforming, seeing rates go the wrong direction perhaps on our competitors. But with our ratings growing on HGTV significantly and on Travel and our belief that Food is in the very short term minor trough, they'll be pulling out of in the next few quarters and into next year. And particularly given that Travel is particularly under-indexed and our ability to continue to grow its audience will provide leverage that we believe will be necessary for us to go on and make that case. Now I'm not saying it'll be easy and we certainly appreciate our distribution partners and all of those concerns that they have, but we also believe that our particular brands bring a unique value to their channel lineup, as well as a unique value to their local ad business. In fact, in some cases, we feel that our contribution to their local ad business, in some way, nets down the rate they're paying us to the point that it may even be net 0 to them, considering the value of our advertising to them. So we're working hard every day to continue towards that point when we do our renewals in '14, '15 and beyond to have another reset of our rates. Whether it's as significant as the last reset, I don't know. But I think the fact remains that we're under-indexed, to use your term, in the marketplace and we intend to work hard to reverse that.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I actually have 3, hopefully, quick ones. Wondering, Joe, if you could share what the core affiliate fee growth would have been in the quarter, if not for the Amazon deal? Secondly, wondering on the SVOD front, do you guys see there as being other SVOD opportunities out there for you, like the Amazon deal and perhaps just other players where there might be incremental opportunities? And then finally, I'm struggling a little, I'm trying to get a sense for -- you talked about the investments in international and digital. And trying to get a sense for what the drag on the segment profit from those 2 will look like over the next 3 quarters of the year. Would you say, Joe, that the first quarter segment profit loss incorporated at other -- in other is a good kind of proxy run rate to use for the rest of the quarters of the year? Or is there anything you could call out that would kind of change the degree of that drag?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Tony, let me play emcee here. We'll have Lori take the Amazon question and John will take the SVOD. And maybe by the time you get back to me, I'll have an answer to [indiscernible].","Lori A. Hickok","Okay. Anthony, on the Amazon deal, it really did not have a huge material impact for the quarter. But it was additive, I'd say low-single digits. And that will continue through the course coming second...","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It will continue? So spread over the coming quarters?","Lori A. Hickok","Yes.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So was that 8.5 -- okay. So it's not lumpy. So that will sort of look like what the trajectory will look like for the rest of the year, in the high singles like that?","Lori A. Hickok","Yes. To clarify what you've seen probably with some of our peers is that they've taken all that income up one time. And that's probably due to the delivery requirements that they have. We actually have refresh requirements throughout. We will be continuing to provide fresh content throughout the term of the contract. And based on that, we'll be recognizing the revenue.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful.","John F. Lansing","Anthony, the answer is yes. We are, though, I will say, not looking to be the leaders in expanding our business to these SVOD over-the-top businesses at the expense of our current distributors, who also have SVOD businesses. And we consider over time the biggest value of opportunity for us, the biggest value proposition, is to grow the current business model through TV Everywhere. But at the same time, we will experiment. We look at Amazon as a good experiment for us. And we'll look at some other over-the-top potential deals. But it isn't our leading edge. Our leading edge is to grow the current business model as well as we can and to see if there are other opportunities in other over-the-top deals. We'll take case-by-case, as they come.","Joseph G. NeCastro","All right, my turn, Anthony. I will answer that question probably in 3 parts or 3 pieces of it. International, which I would expect is moderate as the year progresses, actually look a little bit better at the -- sort of toward the end of the year. The digital investments, I think, it will be sort of a steady as she goes. There'll be a spending throughout the year and that will not moderate significantly as the year goes on. And then the sort of pure corporate piece. And I'd say for that piece, certainly in the first quarter is the largest quarter in terms of spending because due to some of the items that I mentioned in the script. So I think, obviously, 3 moving parts. If you add them all together, I think you should expect to see the first quarter will be the deepest and then to moderate slightly as the year goes on.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Michael Morris with Davenport & Company.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, on the advertising and the sequential acceleration you saw domestically in the first quarter. You talked about pricing and the rating to pick up a little bit. Can you maybe give us a little more granularity on how much is pricing and how much is ratings? And is there a component that has to do with the timing of liability? Or was there simply a sequential ratings performance and a sequential strengthening in advertising? Just help us get perspective looking forward.","Lori A. Hickok","Yes. I'll take that, Michael. Really it's a combination of factors. One is definitely is pricing. That had a huge bearing on what was going on with the strong scatter market. But also rate increase saw the strengths of HGTV and Travel. There's a component of that. And of course, Food, where we're a little bit of a trough. As John alluded, it wasn't so much ratings as much as trying to stay steady. And with ADU liability or make good, we manage those quarter-to-quarter, so they ebb and flow and they will have an impact, but they're not materially huge one way or the other. So I would really say it's pricing combined with the strengths of Travel and HGTV. And really advertisers, again, Ken talked about the quality of our advertisers. So ratings aside, we still have buys and advertisers that want to be on our brand. So that's good.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","So you would say that the sort of sequential improvement didn't have much, let me say, impact or influence from some liabilities being shifted into the fourth quarter that didn't hit you in the first quarter or something like that? It was pretty purely core ratings and pricing growth?","Lori A. Hickok","Correct. That's what I would say. And I would state that liability is always a factor. So even when -- you are always managing liabilities. But those are the 2 drivers.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","All right. That's really helpful. And then just like kind of a housekeeping question. But you guys didn't disclose the subscriber numbers this quarter in earnings release as you have in previous quarters. And I was curious as to why you chose not to give us that information this time?","Lori A. Hickok","Well, to be honest, I think it's just where we are in the evolution of the cable network industry. We started that a long time ago. As we were growing our distribution, we thought it was an important metric in fact. And I think it's very steady now and we pretty much ebb and flow with the universe. So you could expect that our trends on the top line are about the same for our fully distributed networks. And we continue to see modest low-single digit growth on our premium tier networks. So we really -- there's nothing that's outlined in the industry.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Hersh Khadilkar - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Hersh Khadilkar for Ben. Just like a follow-up question on programming spend for Joe and Lori. Ratings at HG and Travel have been strong year-to-date, but has the softness at Food changed your view on cash spend for the year? And then I know you mentioned that the softness is a short-term phenomenon. But to the extent that they do remain challenged for the rest -- for a few more quarters, would you expect to reallocate dollars to more food programming from other networks or potentially increase your overall spending budget?","John F. Lansing","Yes. This is John. I'll take that. No, we don't anticipate shifting dollars from the other networks in terms of programming into Food. Food, we think has a very good plan going into the third quarter and the fourth quarter. We've -- I've had a -- we all have had a good look at the programming lineup. And very confident that they're on the right track, on the right path. And although the first quarter has been a challenge, it was up against the highest quarter in the history of the network in terms of audience delivery. And so the pacing against audience ratings year-over-year becomes a little more moderated as we go forward. But again, I don't see a significant shift in the cost of programming related to that other than what's already in our current plan.","Operator","Our next question will come from Laura Martin with Needham & Company.","Laura A. Martin - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I'd like to ask Ken about mobile. So I'm sitting here at the digital new fronts and all eyes are on a 6-minute original program that Yahoo! and AOL and Google are making. And everybody has a food entry. And I think the idea is when you're in a store and you want to make something for dinner, you watch a quick little video and then you buy the goods. So when you -- you've been really a genius with the flanking brands. And as you think about over 3-year frame moving some of your programming to mobile, could you talk about how you're thinking about flanking brands on digital platforms that have kind of mobile applicability?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes. Thank you, Laura. Yes, we've always believed, you go back to a statement John made earlier about owning the content from day 1, so we had the ability to move it to different platforms. Having said that, we're realizing, just like all the industry is, that different-sized screens and different platforms sometimes require different content. In some ways, it's why you see the movement in the things you have like uLIVE. But we've always had a healthy appetite for moving our content to mobile. Specifically to your question, pricing-wise, right now, I think it's in the very early innings of how this is going to be priced out. Is it going to be additive? Will we see more and more of it at the upfront in years to come wrapped into a total buy, like we're now seeing digital and the cable networks involved. So you will see us definitely be a player there. We already are to a large degree with a lot of the content we have. Our mobile apps have done extremely well. As a matter of fact, the Food Network and Travel and Home have all got leading apps in the App Store. I think still, the #1 culinaries In The Kitchen, as far as a paid app, and we're converting some of those paid apps into free. So we see this as a hugely lucrative area. And again, I think you touched on it, to be able to take our content, especially into retail and the place-based media is just going to be huge. So more to come on that, but part of our all investment strategy is continue to look at all of these different platforms. And as you know, Laura, our big connection is to the advertiser. We want to be where the consumer's going to be and we want to be where the consumer is intersecting with our advertising partners. So it's a huge opportunity for us. It's just early in the stages of how this is going to play out.","Laura A. Martin - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Very helpful. And then on the $8 million -- so  this is, Ken, this one's for you. But on the $8 million tax charge in the quarter, could you reiterate, remind me where you guys are for the full year on your tax rate?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes. Give us a second to think that out, Laura, and I'll come back to that.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, we can come back to you, Laura.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just had a question on international. It seems like some media companies have been very successful expanding internationally and others have sort of tripped up more than once. And I was just wondering, as you sort of think about international expansion, would you mind just sort of elaborating on some of the things, some of the challenges, and how you're sort of planning to avoid some of the pitfalls?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Sure. Yes, this is Joe. I'll take that. Obviously, we are probably 20 years behind some of the initial pioneers in the space and like to think that we have -- some have done well where some have stumbled. I don't want to get in the specific analysis or criticisms of things that have gone before. I think the way we think about it is and it'd be more important for you to know, is that our ambitions are focused. We know what we're good at. And so far, what we've been good at is compelling content and owning as much content and then trying to repurpose that content for different platforms, in this case, only for different markets. And we are starting slow. I think some of those things that are often made, frankly, are overinvestment, too soon in one particular market. And so you've seen the steps we've taken and measured. And after a fair amount of time, analyzing and negotiating specific deals. So it's a little bit of walk before your run, test the programming, see what works in what markets and moderate your spending as you go, so you don't get out over your skis. So that's our approach. I mean, it's generally our approach to be conservative and stick with what we know. And we're going to do the same internationally.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Hey, Jason, if I may just add and Joe's exactly right. But if you go back to the early days, we've actually been syndicating programming internationally for almost 18 years now. And by that, I mean, we've been selling our programming around the world because we chose early on not to go out and launch individual channels. So we've got a track record of 18 years of really knowing what programming is working in what countries, in what cultures. And I think now that you see us going out and doing dedicated networks, obviously, Food and Travel and the Home category, we have more confidence in the countries we go into because of what our syndicated programming has done. And now that we're moving to that in some cases, we're taking the syndicated programming, no longer selling into the open market, moving it onto our dedicated channels. And I think that's why you're seeing the early success like the U.K. Food. You're seeing our programming resonating in countries. So look, it's always going to be a little riskier than domestic, but the better you can make your odds. And I think lastly, we have continued to use the playbook that we have in the states and that is stay in brand. You won't see us varying very much from what we do best and that's the Home, Food and Travel category. Hence, it's why we acquire Travel Channel International. Hence, it's why we just bought the Asian Food Channel. We're kind of doubling down in our categories. And we think of it, eventually, as a global advertising application here that comes into play, too. So we're very optimistic about the future, but as Joe said, we're pretty prudent. And if you followed Scripps for a number of years, we're not necessarily leading edge, but we like to be rather methodical and plotting and how we do it. So I'm very confident about our international strategy, but we're pretty mindful that there are pitfalls out there.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I think I have what qualifies as 2 follow-ups to some of my colleagues' questions. The first on the future of the programming expenses. So another thing we can look at, obviously, is the cash investment you're making in programming. I think we've all seen that. If I'm reading this right, it was down significantly year-over-year this quarter. I'm assuming that's, obviously, just an accident in timing. But I guess what I wanted to inquire about is if there's anything that you could care to share on how we should expect to see that flow over the course of the rest of this year. I mean, one would presume that would reverse and we would see increases year-over-year, maybe substantial ones over the course of the year or maybe not. And I have a follow-up.","Lori A. Hickok","Todd, this is Lori. Yes, you could expect that to increase or moderate over the coming quarters ahead. However, I would point out that some of our spend did occur last year. So as we move premiers and look at counterprogramming, our production schedule ebbs and flows based on that. So one quarter a year ago does not necessarily represent what you would see in a quarter as far as spending. And also we're out buying more episodes of things that are successful versus smaller orders between what would've been in travel as far as trying to find our feet in what might work. So you could see us to be very mindful, very careful about looking at last year's spend, but I would expect our spend to definitely increase over the coming quarters.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That makes a lot of sense. And have you ever felt like sharing the specific timing and amortization schedule, I'm sure we'd all love to see it. The second follow-up was back to the Amazon deal. And I guess what I'm very curious about is, you guys clearly took a cautious approach to sort of decide how you wanted to participate in that market. But then this year, you decided to go ahead and participate. So I'd really love to hear, what were you looking for and what specifically did you see that made you decide, hey, you know what, I think we should try this and do an experiment with Amazon?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes. Sure. The Amazon presented we thought of the best opportunity for us to test the different video marketplace in terms of subscription. And it also presented, because it's Amazon and because we're operating these networks through these categories with an expansive and growing list of products and services and magazines and everything else and books, that we saw an opportunity with Amazon to do something more interesting and slightly bigger than just a video deal. And so if you go on Amazon and look at our page on Amazon, you'll see the opportunity to touch points of other parts of our company through books, magazines, et cetera. And we thought that was an interesting experiment, so we decided to do it.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And I know we're running out of time, but there wasn't any specific sort of ratings data point or cannibalization impact or -- that you could tell us that you were looking at that you said that you saw and got comfortable with the idea of that platform?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Well, we'll look at all that data as it comes in. We're really just end of the deal now and we'll see the consumer adoption. We'll measure that. We'll do our research. We'll see if there's any cannibalization. But those are the reasons we're cautious, because as I said earlier, we are not looking to run away from a great business model called cable and satellite TV. At the same time, we recognize the audience is moving to other platforms and we'll be there and we want to participate. We just want to do it smartly and not just headlong rush into something that might damage the current business model. Because we believe that the TV Everywhere concept is real, it will work, and that we want to be good partners with our incumbent distributors.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Let me jump in real quick, too, before I forget. The full year tax rate guidance hasn't changed. Laura, if you're still on your mobile, we're still looking at a 28% to 30% effective rate for the year.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Tuna Amobi with S&P Capital.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","So if I can stay on that last question. Given the fair amount of archived content that you use on your flanking brands, I was wondering if that is a consideration in terms of when you go out and try to do these deals with the SVOD guys or even TV Everywhere. How does that, perhaps, factor into the programming that you decide to use or even the terms that you're able to secure? Or just kind of the dynamics of that, given your unique situation? And then separately, if I can return to the international theme. With regard to the AFC specifically, perhaps you can provide us some metrics that can help us assess the potential of that asset in that market in general? And if you can comment on how China fits, perhaps, into your long-range plans for Asia, that would be helpful. And then broadly speaking, on international, as you make all these deals and expand, how should we think about the split of your ad and affiliate revenues? Do you pretty much expect that to converge over time, where that's 5, 10 years? And if so, I mean, what -- how should we kind of expect that to play out?","Lori A. Hickok","All right. Hey, Tuna, this is John. I'll start off with your first question. The way we think about it is really in 3 dimensions. The first dimension and the most important, obviously, is our incumbent distributors and their SVOD and TV Everywhere strategies that we participate with fully. And then the second dimension for us is our existing digital businesses of our own: our websites, our apps, our introduction of uLIVE, as a way to exploit video that's exhibited on owned and operated sites of our own that's outside of the affiliate window, but before we go to a third-party, so that we can take advantage of owning our content and monetize it through our own world-class digital properties and expanding those digital properties so that we can achieve greater scale. And then the third dimension is really what I think of as the experimental dimension, dimension with third-party distributors such as Amazon. But really, that third dimension is one that we believe is worth determining, worth understanding, but we want to make sure that we're, obviously, again, solidifying the current business model and exploiting our own digital capabilities through our owned and operated sites. And then we see that third piece as one that will be a little bit more cautious with because it more directly impacts the existing business model.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes, Tuna, on AFC, I'll try to be very brief here. With respect to metrics, I would say, the only thing I would tell you is it's not material to the results at this point. It's more advertising than, clearly, revenue at this point. And we would expect the growth over time to be more on advertising than in the affiliate area. And again, as Ken mentioned, 10 or 11 countries, we're 8-plus million subs all-in. You asked about China specifically -- well, why don't I comment on the markets we're in now. Every market is obviously different. The dynamics are different. And some of those are large, fast-growing markets that we expect a lot out of. But this will unfold. And frankly getting distribution is lumpy and somewhat opportunistic. So we do expect that the overall market dynamics will drive growth there and we expect to enter in more markets as we go. Specifically on China, back to the question on proceeding with caution, that's a market that is, obviously, very exciting for a number of reasons, but also very scary for a number of reasons. Very complicated, I guess, I should say. So we are looking not only at a traditional launch there, but potentially a launch on other platforms where it may make more sense than the traditional television launch. So much more to come. Nothing imminent with respect to China, but certainly on our radar. And then lastly, with respect to the mix of revenue, again, it's going to be market-driven, market-specific. And the mix, ultimately, we expect would be more advertising than affiliate means, but I'm not really sure how that will play out.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","That's very helpful. And if I can just have a quick follow-up. I guess it kind of -- your moves really beg the question, I know Latin America seems to be the next logical outpost, what's your view of that market in terms of the potential -- market potential for your type of programming? Is that something that you have on your radar at this point?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Absolutely. We do think there is great potential for our type of programming. In fact, there's a fair amount of that type of programming in the market. And so that's one of our considerations there. A little more difficult and complicated to enter 2 very large markets that matter a great deal. And you probably saw the announcement, we did hire a managing director for that region and we are underway. But no news specifically to report.","Operator","And the final question then will come from Ben Mogil with Stifel.","Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just talking about the category movement, talking about financial and retail moving up a lot. Did you see those tied to housing and really just tied more to HGTV? Or were you seeing that category moves across all the major channels?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes. Well, certainly a significant piece of it was the -- on the Home category side, major retailers such as Lowe's and Home Depot are taking some big steps towards more advertising. We're getting our fair share of that. But it really is across-the-board on finance and some other categories, Food, that it is -- I think we're feeling just a strengthening economy. Slow as it is, it is expressing itself through a healthy advertiser demand and a healthy scatter marketplace.","Mark W. Kroeger","Thank you, everybody, for your time.

We'll start the conference call today with comments from Ken Lowe, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Joe NeCastro, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. Our prepared remarks should take about 20 minutes, then we'll open it up for your questions. Also on the call is John Lansing, President of the Scripps Networks' Operating Division; and Lori Hickock, Executive Vice President of Finance.","Let me remind you, if you prefer to listen in via the Internet, go to our website, click on Investor Relations and find the microphone icon on the landing page. Additionally on the page under the microphone icon, you'll find our second quarter earnings presentation materials that we'll be referring to during the prepared remarks portion of our call.

Let me remind you that our discussion this morning will contain certain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from those predicted. And some of the factors that may cause the results to differ are set forth in our publicly filed documents, including our Form 10-K. With that, I'll turn it over to Ken.","Kenneth W. Lowe","All right, thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As always, we appreciate your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. We just completed another terrific quarter. Let me just quickly run through some highlights. We saw audience growth at all of our Home and Food category networks. We debuted new travel programming, that is clearly resonating with viewers. We had double-digit growth in advertising and affiliate fee revenue. We just completed our $1 billion dollar share buyback authorization and just announced another $1 billion buyback this week as you probably saw. We also reached an agreement with the country's biggest distribution partner that will make Scripps branded content accessible to millions of our fans on their tablets, smartphones and other new electronic platforms.","And the big news, and I am happy to report, is the successful completion of our best-ever performance in the upfront ad sales marketplace. In fact, in total business booked, we broke through the $1 billion threshold for the first time in our company's history. That gives us a whopping 10% of the marketplace and it puts us in the same league with a very short list of other programming groups. Clearly, we've created a distinct competitive advantage by uniquely defining and staying true to the lifestyle content categories that we own and it's paying off.","Our superior performance is driven by the remarkable power of our programming and our brands. We've establish ourselves as leaders in influencing consumer purchasing decisions in the Home, Food and Travel categories. And that's why our networks and related interactive businesses are must-buys for advertisers and must-carries for content, distributors. Our investment in trendsetting original programming and our commitment to stay focused on our lifestyle categories is delivering industry-leading returns and creating uncommon value for our shareholders. So let's take a look at how we're performing in each of these lucrative content categories and we'll start out with food.","At Food Network, we had our highest rated second quarter ever and ended the period ranked eighth among ad supported cable networks in the 25-54 demo. That is just outstanding. Promising new shows like Mystery Diners, and the eighth season of Food Network Star drove our improved viewership numbers. Also contributing were stalwarts like Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, Chopped All Stars and Restaurant: Impossible, all of which are proving their enduring popularity.","The third quarter has gotten off to a strong start with premiere of Chef Wanted, with Anne Burrell, it's a great new show. I hope you'll have a chance to catch it. And coming up, we're looking forward to another season of the breakout hit Restaurant Stakeout and the ever popular Great Food Truck Race Competition.","And it's worth noting that while we're breaking records on TV, Food Network Magazine is having an outstanding year as well. Newsstand sales are up 16% and ad pages sold continue to grow robustly. All good news and great validation of the multimedia marketing power of the Food Network brand.","Now over at the Cooking Channel, we're literally sizzling. I kid you not. Viewership among adults 25-54 was up 16% year-over-year, and the network is showing no signs of slowing down. New shows like Roadtrip with G. Garvin and new seasons of Easy Chinese and Eat St. all contributed to Cooking Channel's excellent performance.","Turning now to the Home category. HGTV tied for its best ever quarter in adult 25-54 viewership. Viewers have [indiscernible] time and time again just how much they love our signature series, including House Hunters, House Hunters International and Homes Inspection. They're also discovering new favorites like Property Brothers and Love It Or List It, which all seem to be performing well no matter where we schedule them. And later this summer and this fall, we'll be premiering several new shows including one called Buying and Selling that leverages the popularity of Property Brothers Drew and Jonathan Scott. Now in this new series, Drew and Jonathan help home owners fix up and sell their current home and then buy and renovate their new home. Another new concept is Natural Born Sellers, where viewers will be able to follow some of California's most sought-after and successful real estate agents. Now these folks have some pretty big personalities and unlike any real estate agents that most people are likely to know -- you'll see on the show, true characters and we have great hopes for it.","Our new supercharged lineup at HGTV should be great fun and we do really hope you'll all tune in. We built HGTV into a powerful, respected consumer brand, which is evident in the success of our second publishing venture. Sales of HGTV's Magazine's third issue exceeded everyone's expectations, prompting us and our partners at Hearst to green light more issues in 2013 and importantly, boost sales expectations for the magazine. In this case, it's a very good thing when lightning strikes twice, first the Food Network Magazine and now the HGTV Magazine, both doing extremely well.","Also in the Home category, DIY Network outperformed in the second quarter, thanks to its avid fan base of home improvement enthusiasts. DIY Network had its best quarter ever for adults 25-54 on the strength and popularity of The Vanilla Ice Project, Renovation Realities and Rehab Addict. It's clear that both of our top quality premium tier channels are very much in high demand.","And what we've done for the Home and Food categories, well, we're doing for Travel as well. Time spent viewing on Travel Channel improved significantly during the second quarter, and we're seeing encouraging growth in destination viewing. We also seen a very promising uptick in ratings points in adult 25-54 viewership in recent weeks, all signs that tell us we're on the right track. We're defining the network and the genre with some entertaining new shows, series and concepts. They're really out of the Scripps playbook, and they're finding an engaged audience. Hotel Impossible and Baggage Battles, 2 shows the premiered in the second quarter have performed well and have been picked up for another season. A couple of other promising new shows that we've added to the schedule are Trip Flip and Top Spot. Now in Trip Flip, fan favorite Bert Kreischer hijacks unsuspecting vacationers and hijacks them in a good way, I might add, and treats them to the adventure of a lifetime. It's a fun show. And in Top Spot, vacation planning takes on a House Hunters look as vacationers inspect and choose between 3 resort hotels or experiences at their chosen destinations. Both shows obviously, are variations of successful Scripps formats that are proving to work in the travel genre as well. In total, we'll have 6 new series premiering on Travel Channel during the third quarter, all very promising. So keep tuned to the Travel Channel. There is more to come.","Now the appeal of our multimedia lifestyle content is evident on interactive platforms as well. Our lifestyle digital businesses continue to flourish, averaging about 25 million unique visitors and 430 million page views a month. Our food and home websites are among the top content sites in their respective genres based on the tremendous amount of traffic that each generates. And to further demonstrate their appeal to consumers, our brands have some of the leading paid apps in their respective categories as well. For example, HGTV's Shelf app launched to positive reviews and","quickly reached the #1 ranking lifestyle app on iTunes. And at Food Network, our In the Kitchen app has recorded more than 523,000 downloads, while Travel Channel's Man v. Food Challenge app has more than 172,000. Both are paid apps, by the way.","And we continue to engage fans on popular social networks. Food Network has already crossed 3 million friends on Facebook, and HGTV has more than 2 million friends. So suffice it to say, consumers and advertisers are well aware of the reach, popularity and utility of our digital platforms.","On the international front, we continue to have productive conversations with various partners around the globe, exploring a variety of potential business opportunities. Additionally, as you know, we completed the Travel Channel International acquisition during the second quarter and the integration with the existing business is well underway. As part of the integration, we've been focusing on leveraging programming opportunities. We're already planning to air some Travel Channel U.S. programming on Travel Channel International this fall.","At our other international properties, our lifestyle programming continues to resonate with consumers. Food Network, in both the U.K. and South Africa is showing year-over-year double-digit audience increases. In the U.K., we just launched 24\/7 on Freeview. And even with the Olympics, we're seeing strong increases in viewers in the U.K. At the U.K., they set all-time high audience records for the UKTV for the first 6 months of this year. In fact, UKTV is the fastest growing network group in terms of audience delivery.","Our international team and partners are off to a great start, and we expect there'll be other exciting international developments in the coming quarters, so stay tuned, as we say.","Overall, I'd have to say things are going very well for Scripps Networks Interactive and its shareholders. Nearly all of the key trends and measures are moving in the right direction. And as we've been saying, it looks like 2012 will be another positive year. Now here's Joe to go over the financial results. Joe?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to touch on some of the second quarter highlights and provide a little color on what drove our positive results, and then we'll open it up for Q&A.","First, let me mention that starting here in the second quarter, we decided to modify our income statement presentation. We're now presenting a little more detail on the face of the income statement by presenting cost of services separate from selling and administrative expenses.","Now looking at the quarter results, starting with the consolidated view. Total revenue was up 13% on strong advertising and affiliate fee revenue growth. Total segment profit was up 3.9%, which reflects the expected higher programming marketing and employee spending we've noted on previous earnings calls and as we've reflected in our annual guidance.","For the second quarter, income from continuing operations, attributable to SNI grew about 19% to $0.93 per share. Earnings per share were also positively affected by the share repurchase program and by the increase in equity earnings of affiliates, which I'll discuss later on the call.","During the second quarter, we repurchased 4.6 million shares of stock at a cost of $250 million. Over the past year, we've repurchased 21.4 million shares of stock for $1 billion. And, as Ken just said, you probably saw our announcement on Tuesday, that the board approved another $1 billion buyback program.","Looking at the key revenue drivers for the quarter. We finished with stronger-than-expected advertising sales, up 12% versus last year. We also had better than expected affiliate fee revenues, which were up 16% compared with the second quarter last year.","Our networks benefited from the strength of the ad marketplace, with second quarter scatter versus scatter pricing up in the mid-to-high single digits year-over-year, and up in the high teens over the broadcast upfront.","As for advertising categories, our top 5 were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, auto and financial, all pretty consistent with prior quarters.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, the scatter advertising market, while still healthy, isn't quite as strong as it was the second quarter. Year-over-year, scatter versus scatter pricing growth is running in the mid-to-high single digits, and up in the mid-to-high teens over 2011 broadcast upfront. Some of this softening, we suspect, is attributable to the Olympics, of course.","Overall, the general tone among our advertisers continues to be very positive, however. Now Ken mentioned our record upfront, let me provide a little color there. We finished right at the top of our cable peers, again, with healthy high single-digit gains in CPM pricing and low double-digit gains in total dollar volume commitments. Breaking the $1 billion barrier was a huge accomplishment for us. So kudos to Steve Gigliotti, President of Ad Sales and Jon Steinlauf, EVP of Ad Sales and their entire team for this great accomplishment. Really proud of that gang.","We did particularly well monetizing the audience we're building at Travel Channel, while advertiser demand for HGTV and Food Network inventory remained exceptionally strong. Our success in the upfront speaks to the desirability of our lifestyle networks as valued programming environments, with highly engaged viewers who are passionate about food, home and travel. As has been the case historically, advertisers are willing to pay up for networks like ours that can deliver engaged, upscale viewers who are willing to spend discretionary income to buy key goods and services.","And turning to the distribution side of our business, affiliate fee revenue grew about 16% in the second quarter. The increase is attributable to the renewal of about 25% of Food Network's distribution base at the end of 2011 and some positive contributions from our new international operations.","Now let's take a look at our domestic operating segment, Lifestyle Media. Revenues were up 12% on the strong advertising and affiliate fee growth I previously mentioned. Total segment costs were up about 18% during the quarter, and segment profit was up 7% from the prior-year period.","Driving the segment costs, program amortization was up 20%. We continue to expect amortization expense growth to be in the mid-to-high single digits for the second half of the year.","Nonprogramming expenses increased 16% compared with the prior year second quarter. This growth was primarily related to 2 items, first, employee costs as we've increased headcount to support our business initiatives, and marketing and promotion expense as we move some high profile programming into the second quarter in anticipation of the Olympics.","In the second quarter of 2012, we generated about $10 million of international revenue that was included in our consolidated results. We also generated about $21 million of equity earnings of affiliates, and a little over half of that was from our international partnerships. While these figures affect different parts of the P&L, in total, our international operations and partnerships are generating a growing amount of income.","As I indicated earlier, during the second quarter we repurchased 4.6 million shares of our own stock for $250 million. We ended the second quarter with $262 million in cash, including $34 million we generated from continuing operating activities. Cash flow from operations was lower this quarter due to the timing of some tax payments compared with the prior year.","And finally, a word about guidance. Total revenue is now expected to increase between 10% and 12% for the year, as a result of the better-than-expected advertising revenue during the first half of the year, and the Travel Channel International acquisition. Nonprogramming expenses are now expected to increase between 16% and 18%. Contributing to this increase is the inclusion of Travel Channel International operating and integration expenses and a decision by the company to accelerate marketing and promotional programs to further drive audience growth at its lifestyle networks.","And finally, as a result of some favorable tax items, the company's effective tax rate is now expected to be between 28% and 30% on the year. The company also reaffirms all of its other previously issued guidance.","With that, we are ready for questions, Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Janedis with UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You've been aggressive, obviously, in rolling out the new programming this year. Ken, on the marketing front, what are you doing for returning shows, meaning for like a Designer or Food Star? Are you spending a lot more to market those shows? And also new shows due to audience fragmentation? And are you using new platforms to attract viewers?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Sure, John, go ahead, John.","John F. Lansing","Yes, John, this is John. Actually, we have focused much of our marketing spend on the existing, we call them tent-pole series, such as Food Network Star, Design Star, on the theory that -- and even House Hunters and House Hunters International -- on the theory that driving time spent viewing, along with cume, is really what drives our ratings and allows us to launch new programming on the backs of those shows by bringing a larger audience into the shows that are already well-known.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Joe, and then maybe, yes, you called out the Olympics, obviously, way back in '08 as you guys were spinning off. I know it's hard to size the impact I guess today, but can you tell us what you're seeing from back to school? And is your underlying assumption that scatter pricing reaccelerates post the Olympics for Labor Day?","Joseph G. NeCastro","John, I'm going to take a pass on that one. It's hard to tell, it's hard to call out exactly the effect of the Olympics, as always. I think the -- in general, it creates some additional tension in the marketplace. It's good to see NBC doing well with that -- but it's hard for us to parse out the effect of the Olympics. As far as pricing going forward, I think that's an overall market dynamic. And the Olympics, in or out, I'm not sure it's going to change the scatter pricing. John, do you have any...?","John F. Lansing","The other major dynamic is political advertising that'll be putting a lot of demand into the marketplace. And since we purposely don't take political advertising, that should help drive some demand towards our channels and help support pricing.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I want to try to get to margins on a go-forward basis. It seems like you've annualized the major increase in programming investment that you've been making, but there's still more work to be done with Travel, right? So I was hoping you could give us a sense of how much of the programming cost growth this year is specific to investing in Travel, and how much more you think there is to go? I think you said in the past that about half of the primetime hours in Travel are now being programmed under this year's schedule. And the reason I'm headed in this direction is I want to get a sense of next year, whether we're back to flat top margins after the investment phase you've been in.","Lori A. Hickok","This is Lori. You are correct, that Travel is driving a lot of our programming increase and that should continue for the next couple of years, as we change the programming hours. I think we've talked about this before, but the level of programming -- new programming that's been generated for Travel is less than what we do for HGTV and Food. So we're on a track to do that, but we can't do it overnight. So I think you'll continue to see that. And with success, the quicker that will happen, with shows and finding kind of what the returning series will be and the original. But there is still some incremental investment, as John talked about, on some of our tent-poles and those things in HGTV and Food, as we continue to drive ratings and performance there.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So does that imply that maybe we go from, yes, the double-digit programming cost growth we've had, because of the incremental investment in Food and HGTV in addition to Travel down to, you say, mid-to-high single digits when you normalize Food and HGTV?","Lori A. Hickok","Yes, that's a fair assumption. It should decelerate. But keep in mind we will make choices from time to time to continue to accelerate in Travel. But yes, the trend is the right one.","Operator","Next we have Michael Nathanson with Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I just have a couple for Joe. Joe, I wondered with the announcement of the $1 billion buyback, is that at all conditional upon your ability to finally buy in the food stake from Tribune? Or is that going to be a separate track from your ability to buy into the Tribune stake?","Joseph G. NeCastro","It is entirely separate from our ability to buy in the Tribune stake. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that one will not affect the other. If we find that we're in the middle of negotiations, it certainly might affect the pace of the buyback program. But we certainly -- we've done the math. We are pleased to proceed with both.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then, let me just ask quickly on the -- your guidance on the nonprogramming expense growth. You mentioned some of it's marketing and some of it's the incorporation of bringing in Travel International. Could you give us a sense of the step-up, which is 600 basis points? Is that roughly split between bringing in Travel and increased marketing?","Lori A. Hickok","I think --","Kenneth W. Lowe","Go ahead, Lori.","Lori A. Hickok","I'll go ahead and answer that. I think this year, you're going to see little more of that towards TCI business -- that's probably a fair assessment now. But we've got integration costs this year, along with just the increased operating expense, as Joe said in the opening remarks.","Operator","And we have a question now from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was just wondering, for Joe, if you look at the -- your increase in your guidance, the delta for the new guidance range versus yield and you attributed the inclusion of Travel Channel International as part of that delta, can you put a little bit more of a finer point on it? Is it about half of the increase? Is it more or less than half? Can you help us with that?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Sure. I think the -- of the increase, it's roughly half, I'd say at this point. That's a fair assessment. But we were very pleased with the domestic growth as well. And that's -- that alone would've gotten us to increase the range.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just going back to John's question. I mean, we're just all trying to figure out to what extent do we shift the -- shift dollars from third quarter to fourth quarter. I mean, can you commit to the fact that, we should probably model an acceleration 3Q to 4Q? And what are the other dynamics going on? I think you talked about high single-digit CPM increases in upfront, which kick in, in the fourth quarter. Wondering if you could also share the sellout ratio split as you move from third quarter to fourth quarter. It'll help us think about it.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes, Anthony, I'm -- we try to stay away from quarter-to-quarter guidance. I think hopefully, if you want to follow up with Mark on modeling-type questions. But I do think it's fair to assume that some of those positive effects you mentioned on the fourth quarter will help -- will probably result in a pattern, sort of like what you're implying there.","Operator","Next question will come from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just have one question and a quick clarification on something you said previously. First, I guess the first question is, could you give us a bit of an update on where you're seeing the most success or biggest contribution outside the U.S., Travel International, separately, I guess where else are you seeing good growth? And any change in sort of your outlook in those businesses, given the concerns in Europe and  [indiscernible] the macro environment? And then just a clarification, I think Joe, I think you said that the scatter market has softened in the third quarter because the Olympics. But I think I heard, the mid-to-high single-digit scatter over scatter growth. Did I mishear that? It's -- because it sounds like the scatter over scatter growth is similar to what you said it was in the second quarter.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes, I'll clarify that. That is, you did hear correctly. It's still in the same range, but it's a little softer than it was before, sort of lower versus upper end in that range, I was -- the way that we characterize it. And if -- after I answer the other one, if John wants to add some color that will be fine, too. But as far as outside the U.S., most of our ratings are -- have been very, very strong, especially in the U.K. We've done some things there to shore up that business. We are now on 24\/7 on the Freeview platform there, and that's had a very, very positive effect on our ratings and our projected growth. That will be a good story for us. South Africa, we continue to do well. The troubles in the rest of Europe did have an effect on our projections for the business for UKTV, which is a much broader-based business. And in fact, we planned for a bit of a sideways year there. And we're happy to report that they have been exceeding those expectations and have really outstripped the growth in the market, which is a tribute to the good management team there and the programming decisions they've made, and just the quality of the programming even coming from the BBC into that partnership. So fingers crossed there. We hope for a very strong finish to the year as well. And that is by far the largest investment, largest effect on our international results at this point. We sort of like to believe that some of the weakness there may also open up opportunities for us to either acquire or venture with other partners there. So we're looking at -- very aggressively in this period because it's a good opportunity for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Morris with Davenport.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","My first question is on your expenses and looking forward beyond 2012, especially in light of the step up in the guide you gave today. A couple of things that you've highlighted specifically in the past, 1 was about $30 million of incremental spending on new initiatives this year. And then now we have this step up in part due to increased marketing on your nets and in part due to the TCI consolidation. So as we look at the number that you're guiding to this year, and we look into next year, can you help us understand any component of that, that won't be recurring next year?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Well, maybe Lori can add fill in some color here. But certainly, the integration expenses related to the acquisition will not occur and the $30 million was made up of 2 or 3 different parts for us, mostly these new developing initiatives. It's hard to tell what that number is going to grow to or shrink to. It depends on the results and the pace of investment. And we will moderate that or accelerate that depending on the attractiveness of those opportunities. In fact, it would probably be good news if we could spend more on some of those. Then that would mean they're attractive enough to keep pushing on. So it's hard to peer forward. The best thing we can do is to continue to call those out so you know the effect of those. I'd say the -- on the sort of overall, the base of the operating expenses, I wouldn't expect to see very aggressive growth going forward. But these items on top, like the opportunistic marketing and the investment in these other growth initiatives, those are going to be -- could be lumpy and may affect the numbers. But the core underlying trend should be very reasonable, going forward.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","And just to be clear on the TCI integration, I apologize if you said this. But you said kind of the of the 600 basis point step up in that nonprogramming guide, half is TCI and half is the domestic marketing. How much of the TCI portion is kind of the nonrecurring integration?","Joseph G. NeCastro","It was a pretty significant chunk of it, but not, certainly not all of it. That we -- it's an ongoing business and it -- the operating expenses are -- I don't know, they're reasonably significant for that side of the business. It's a -- so I can't tell you exactly what that is. But it's, it was a few million dollars on the integration.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just one other item, if I could real quickly. With respect to your buyback and the cash that you maintain on the balance sheet, is there a level of cash that you feel comfortable not going below, as we look at what your behavior can look like, going forward?","Joseph G. NeCastro","We have a number of parameters we use as we execute that program, and one of those is a liquidity parameter. So it's both a combination of the cash balances and availability on the revolver. So I don't think this is -- it's appropriate to lay out all those parameters. But suffice to say, we do have liquidity parameters that we follow.","Operator","We have a question from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. The first is, can you give a sense of how much of your advertising growth in the quarter came from sort of the integrated, nontraditional spot side versus the more traditional spot side? And the second question is, your ratings certainly this quarter have been less volatile than some of your competition and more successful. And I guess I was wondering, one of the big differences is between you and your competition is that you have less or very little of your content available on SVOD over the top subscription services. Do you see a correlation between that? Or do you think it's coincidental? What are your thoughts around that?","John F. Lansing","Yes, Dave, this is John. I'd be happy to tackle that. On the first part of your question, I actually wasn't quite clear what you're asking between integrated advertising and traditional, but we'll come back to that. In terms of ratings, we have just had a stellar quarter in terms of ratings. HGTV really began to gain a great deal of momentum. And Food Network, as you heard Ken say, had the best quarter in its history, certainly coming out of that. They're -- both of them are having extremely strong -- or had extremely strong Julys just prior to the Olympics kicking in. So that momentum continues. And even on Travel Channel, we're really seeing in July one of the strongest rating months pre-Olympics that we've had since we've acquired the network. But to your point about over-the-top, we have been cautious and we were purposely not early movers in aggressive over-the-top deals for the very reason that you point out, that the value of a rating point in this ecosystem is so much more valuable to us that to put it at risk for a relatively small one-time uptick of revenue, to us, just seemed like something that was much better in a wait-and-see mode and to see how it did affect ratings. And I can't certainly draw a straight line between deals that were done and ratings issues at our competitors. But I will say that we will be moving forward cautiously in the over-the-top world. But we'll start in the over-the-top world that exists in our current business model, and that's TV Everywhere. We are a strong believer in the value of TV Everywhere to our consumers and to the strengthening of our existing distribution relationships with the multi-channel universe. So that's where we are today and I wouldn't anticipate anything dramatic in the near future.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just said that the [indiscernible] on the side -- the other question was, you do a lot of sort of in-show product placement sponsorship, not necessarily what we'd equate with a typical, just a 30-second spot. And so the question was, how much of that is driving your business versus sort of core CPMs times rating points on traditional spots?","Kenneth W. Lowe","This is Ken. Look, it's a very astute observation on your point -- on your part, because we've been doing that from day 1, because we see these brands with value-added components. And that's helped pretty much restructure the ad sales over the years. So it's very hard for us to break out. Let's just take something like Dream Home, where we have a lot of integrated advertising. But those are wrapped into the upfront sales packages. So we don't necessarily break that out. But I think your point gives me an opportunity just to talk about the advantage we have with these passion power brands, where we can sell beyond just the 30s and 60s and truly do an integrated ad sales. And I think that's part of the reason, quite frankly, that we've had this stellar upfront market we just experienced.","Operator","We will go next to Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I had a broad question on TV Everywhere. Correct me if I'm wrong. Are we -- I don't think we're in a spot now where Nielsen is sort of measuring sort of IP delivery of video. And I was just wondering, as you go down this TV Everywhere path, from a timing standpoint, how much of mismatch do you think there could be between when your content's available online and when you think Nielsen will begin measuring that? And did that influence your decision at all to go forward with Comcast?","John F. Lansing","Yes, I know, Jason, this is John. It's absolutely a key point and was front and center in our negotiations. Our understanding is that Nielsen will be prepared to measure in the first quarter of 2013, which would coincide with our launch of TV Everywhere with Comcast. And by that time, we should have some other significant deals done, authenticated deals done as well. And once you get past the measurement issue, which obviously is key to your point, then you have the advantage of being able to count eyeballs beyond C3 and into the fourth day and beyond through the TV Everywhere VOD application. So over the long haul, once measurement is solved, then it creates even a greater opportunity to drive impressions for programming.","Operator","We have a question now from Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question on the upfront. You said the CPMs are up high single digits and total volume commitments, low double-digit. Wondered if you could talk about the implication that you sold more inventory across all your networks. Is that in fact what you did? Or did you pull back some inventory like in maybe Travel Channel? And by selling more inventory, is that sort of -- give an indication of your view on what scatter might look like over the next couple -- as you look into 2013?","John F. Lansing","Yes, I'll take that. This is John, Eric. No, we were -- our inventory usage in this year's upfront was in the range that we normally operate within by -- within a 4- to 6-point range between high 40s, low 50s. We were within that range. What really drove it for us was our best-of-class pricing. Steve Gigliotti and his group just did an outstanding job and once again led our peer group in terms of pricing increase. And as a result of the growth in the total volume of the cable marketplace, I think there was roughly about a 5% volume growth for all of cable. Scripps Networks took 18% of that growth. So in leading the market, we were able to capitalize on capturing the growth. And our team does that, not only by driving pricing but by really smartly churning out the low CPM business when they can and replacing it with a high CPM business and continuing to enrich in the full aggregate advertising on all of our networks.","Operator","Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask -- and I apologize if you've talked about this before, and then just please then feel free to ignore me. I wanted to ask about the investment in programming across the networks. I think if you look at last year, the cash spend was up about 30%. It's up 30% the first half of the year. And clearly, that's benefiting you in the upfront and on the top line, so definitely money well spent. But Lori, I thought you said that programming amortization expense growth would slow in '13. And I just wanted to see if that is what you said and if it is, how does that foot up with the cash increase on the cash flow statement?","Lori A. Hickok","Absolutely, yes that's what I did say, that you should see some deceleration. We also talked about Travel Channel and continuing to build on the hours that we invest in there. Again, the cash spend, you've got to be careful about because it's tied to the premieres, the type of shows and different things. So yes, our cash is up year-over-year. But then again, you have to take into account the timing and it's not necessarily apples to apples from years to year. You talk -- you heard John talk about, we've accelerated some programming earlier in the year, some of our premier programming. That has an impact. So you're seeing that in the first half of this year and it continues to have an impact as we go through our amortization life cycle. But yes, you should start to see some moderation in that.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then, I just wanted to ask a follow-up, John, to Jason's question on Nielsen. Do you know -- will they be able to measure TV Everywhere streaming data, streaming views with different ad loads? I think one of the big issues was if the ad loads and sort of what you were running varied across, kind of an on-demand versus a sort of time delayed on-demand platform versus live linear -- have they figured that piece out, do you know?","John F. Lansing","That's exactly what they're working on, although our bias is towards mirroring the ad load in the TV Everywhere model. And we believe that can be the case, I think it has proven to be the case in some other situations. But as you get into VOD further out from C3, I think you could have varying ad loads. And that is, I think, one of the hurdles that they're solving for, absolutely.","Operator","Next question is from Ben -- I'm sorry, Tom Egan with Canaccord Genuity.","Thomas W. Eagan - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","You mentioned interest in ventures or investment overseas. Could you give us a little bit more color on what you're thinking about, like for example, what markets, what dollar size and whether any JV would be consolidated or not?","Joseph G. NeCastro","I'll give you my -- just a sort of a look forward there. We are very focused on certain geographic targets around the world, and I don't think anything would surprise you. Certainly Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia are the most important targets for our programming. But that's not to say we don't have good opportunities in -- even in Western Europe and in Africa, even. But the ones I mentioned at the top are probably our most important targets. The size of the potential investments is really hard to calibrate. I will say that the investment we made in UKTV is certainly at the top end, I think of anything we've even seen since then. They're just not a lot of very large opportunities that are -- that would be in our wheelhouse, because we are trying to capitalize on our expertise in lifestyle. And there just aren't a lot of huge plays out there in lifestyle assets. Our bias, obviously, is to acquire majority stakes and consolidate wherever possible. We're building an infrastructure to support businesses that we can manage rather than have to rely on partners to manage and hopefully put us in a position with the infrastructure on our programming to be the majority partner wherever we have a partner, and then consolidate. So that's our sort of primary thrust in international, if you...","Thomas W. Eagan - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Is there any timing we should -- that we should be thinking about? Like do you want to make a decision before the end of the year? Or would you be thinking about '13?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Well, these are ongoing. It's very hard to predict. We have a number of conversations underway, and it's just hard to predict timing on them. I would say it's just not something that we're willing to put out there, a specific timing on any of them.","Operator","We have a question now from Alan Gould with Evercore Partners.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","First a clarification. You mentioned that half of the increase in revenue guidance was to TCI. Was half of the nonprogramming expense increase also due to TCI? And secondly, could you tell us how much TCI does or did in 2011 in revenue and EBITDA?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Alan, this is Joe. That is what we said on both the revenue and expense. It's, let's say you have to have a -- take those with a plus or minus on them. I don't have the TCI 2011 results with me at the moment, I apologize, but we can certainly get that to you.","Operator","Next question is from Vasily Karasyov with Susquehanna.","Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I had a question on Travel Channel ratings. And I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that some shows worked out really well. If my data is correct, it looks like total day and primetime were both down every month in the quarter. So my question is, what should we be looking at to judge the success of the new programming initiatives? And then as a follow up, if you -- if we assume total cable viewing is somewhat flat, and you would have to take market share to grow viewership at Travel Channel, where do you think that would come from? And is it possible at all that it could cannibalize Food or HGTV?","John F. Lansing","Yes, Vasily, this is John. I'll take that. Your point is right. In terms of the second quarter, our slate that we are, really excited about, really didn't hit in full until the beginning of July in the third quarter. It's really targeted to the third quarter. And I'm really happy to let you know that while Travel was a minus 15 in the second quarter, it was flat in July to last year's July. So it really saw some acceleration in July. And that's just prior to the Olympics kicking in. And the other stat that we find very encouraging that's undergirds that acceleration in ratings is time spent viewing. That's a stat that we watch very closely. And that had been an issue for travel because it was so reliant on really 2 series when we acquired the network, Man v. Food and No Reservations. And Man v. Food just wore out quickly, unfortunately. And when it did, it took a lot of the time spent viewing with it on the network. Now, as we have 5 or 6 series beginning to kick in and show ratings growth, we've seen time spent viewing almost double to 43 minutes per night from where it was at a low point, and up 13% just from last quarter. So that -- the key indicators for travel are very positive, and I feel very good about the slate that our team there has put together on a going forward basis. And you can anticipate some new series launches -- back to our investment in programming -- you can anticipate some new series launches in the fourth quarter as well that should continue that momentum. In terms of whether that's -- we're concerned about whether that's cannibalizing our ratings, I can only look to the data, and the data shows us that Food Network and HGTV are at all-time highs in terms of their ratings, while Travel has grown its ratings into July. We think about it very much, and we understand that some of the Travel programming, particularly as it relates to food can be impactful to Food. But once again, as you look at our entire Food category, and the growth of Food Network, the growth of Cooking Channel and now the growth of Travel, I guess my argument would be that we are gaining a hold of and controlling a major television category and owning it. And -- so my concerns about cannibalization are not really supported by any data.","Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Do you know where the incremental viewers are coming from, from what other categories? Just out of curiosity.","John F. Lansing","Yes, it would be a reach for me to identify this network or that network. You're absolutely right. It's a share shift. That's just the nature of television to get a viewer from one channel to another. But again, ratings are reliant not just on a viewer moving from one channel to another. They're also reliant on having a viewer that you already have on your channel remaining there, and not changing channels. And that's that time spent viewing stat that I was -- that data point that I discussing earlier.","Operator","We have a question from Amy Yong with Macquarie.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Research","You have a couple of high profile affiliate fee negotiations recently. When you think about 2013 and Travel comes up for renewal, how confident are you on raising fees in this kind of environment?","John F. Lansing","Yes, so this is John. We -- Travel, obviously is a work in progress, and it is progressing. And we will have renewals for Travel along the way. But we really feel like it'll be a more than one-step process for Travel. And to the extent that we have a positive story on ratings, then our ability to grow those affiliate fees moves accordingly. And I have confidence we'll be able to do that, as time progresses. Now 2013 is not a drop-dead date for Travel. There are renewals in '14 and '15 as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Tuna Amobi with S&P Capital IQ.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","So I guess, on the equity earnings affiliate line, I was trying to maybe get a better sense of the run rate as we look to the back half. I know you said half of the Q2 number was related to the international JV, which was just kind of trying to get a sense of how we should think about that, going forward.","Lori A. Hickok","There's really not going to be a major shift there in this current year. And in fact, as you heard Joe talk, the market in which UKTV is operating is a fairly tough one right now, even though they're at the top of the field, and we also acquired that last year. So a little tougher comps in the back half. But I would look at the run rate and kind of -- and factor that, looking at that.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","Okay, that's great. So for Ken, so you guys did a very good job, maybe an understatement, to kind of monetize your ratings gains upfront and you threw out some pretty amazing stats there in terms of your share of the overall market and the CPM, et cetera. I was just kind of trying to get a sense, as you think about some of your peers that have been bemoaning, actually, their inability to kind of close that gap fast enough between the revenue and the audience gains, and yet you guys are getting a disproportionate share of your -- of the market. I'm wondering if you think that -- as you look out in the next few years, if you think that you will be able to sustain that pace? And how much, at this point do you think in your particular case, that gap is in play, in terms of potentially motivating you guys? It seems like, with the kind of ratings that you've gotten across your networks, there is still possibility that there's still a lot more headroom ahead. So, how do you think about that in the overall context of the cable advertising marketplace?","Kenneth W. Lowe","True, Tuna, well, yes, first and foremost, we absolutely believe there's upside to all of our networks. And I think John touched on a couple of things. I mean, as we look at new platforms and new technology and more definitive ways to measure audiences, that's going to play very much into our favor because as you know, somewhat of a broken record, but love to talk about it, the quality of audience that we deliver, psychographically, demographically, upscale and highly educated women, continues to be at the top of every advertiser's wish list. Add to that, these passion brands. And passion continues to play out by the way in all forms of media, including social media, because passion drives not only viewership but interactivity. And then coupled with the fact that we have a very, very safe environment, if you will, for our advertisers. And more and more, I think, as advertisers are looking where to place their dollars, they are looking for safe, they're looking for reliable and they're looking for trustworthy. And that's never more been in vogue. It's not going away. It's going to continue. And I think it's from our internal research and it's what gets played back every day. I think you heard me rattle off some numbers about the number of friends that the Food Network and HGTV and all our networks have on Facebook, and the opportunity that people now have to use Twitter and socialize around these networks. So we not only see upside, we see continued growth. And the opportunity, I think, to enrich our relationships beyond just what we've been doing for a few years successfully, that's the 30s and 60s, I mentioned earlier, and that's these integrated advertising arrangements that we have. So all in all, this is not by accident. This is a lot of years in the making. This is a lot of hard work by some really incredibly talented people, both on the programming side, on the production side and on the ad sales side. So I'm very bullish on the future. And thank you for pointing out that we had a stellar quarter against some of our competitors.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","That's helpful. Just quick clarification on how much of this recent growth has come from endemic advertisers?","_","John F. Lansing","I think it's fair to say it's in the 60% range is endemic. Okay, Food, of course, is more endemic because of the advertising on Food Network than on Home. But if you aggravate everything, it's in the 60% range.","Kenneth W. Lowe","I think the good thing, Tuna, is, in the early days, we were very reliant on endemic. But as these brands have grown, there's very few advertisers you don't see lined up with us, and some of that's younger males. We don't get a lot of fast food. We don't get as many soft drink dollars and things of that nature. But all in all, that these are broad-based networks. But the endemic, I think, is just indicative of the fact that in the categories we're in, again back to the safe buys, so they're must buys. So you get those endemics showing up every year. And by the way, it costs a little more this year, and will cost a little more next year.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","Is it fair to expect that your endemic base could actually grow to over half by next year, perhaps, sometime next year?","Kenneth W. Lowe","I wouldn't want to speculate on that. I don't have those numbers in front of me. But again, I think the very positive thing is every year when we go to the upfront, we go to advertisers, it helps when you can lay that base in and that base continues to support us. And that just is, I think, underscores the categories we're in, Home, Food and Travel and how valuable they'll be going forward.","Operator","Our final question will come from Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities.","Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","I was just curious. You didn't say  [indiscernible] you were dealing with the MSOs stateside, over in the U.K., you're working with Freeview. You've gotten very good results there. Can you talk about how you're adjusting to the market over there, and what versions [ph] doing with TiVo as well? And then this is a broader question. When you look at the foodie phenomenon in the States, and you look at the markers for that activity in some of the other countries you're going into, do you feel like you're having to educate people with the process, or do you think there's a lot of latent demand that you can just hit, practically as soon as you get on the track, so to speak?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, Matthew, let me take the last part of that question. This won't surprise you at all. There are people internationally waiting for the Food Network to show up. We live in a global society. It's amazing now, how many people in these countries that we're entering are already familiar with Guy Fieri from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, or Ina Garten or Bobby Flay. These are becoming global personalities, and I think it was never more evident than when we launched in the U.K. The immediate success of a lot of the Food Network domestic programming. We know from our partnership at the BBC it even took them by surprise a little bit because in the UKTV partnership we have a competitive Good Food Channel -- but quite frankly, we've been able to beat with Food U.K. So just the opposite. We're finding whatever the country, with very few exceptions, I think it's safe to say, Joe. People are waiting with open arms to have the Food Network into their country. Now there are some variations and it helps if there are already some stars, some chefs in some of these countries that we can put on the network and popularize. But we're very encouraged by the fact that there are foodies everywhere.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Matthew, on the distribution side of that question. On the Food Network U.K., we are on Freeview and we're on the unpaid tier on Sky. So we don't have distribution issues the way others do. We have a single revenue source business for Food Network U.K. Now UKTV, obviously is on all platforms, paid and free. And we do see the dynamics around the entrance there. In fact, there is good competitive tension. Virgin's strategy, is obviously one of them that we have to tailor our approach to, as we do with BSkyB there, the largest distributor on the paid platforms. So I think they've had a great track record, UKTV, of securing distribution and getting paid for their content. And we have renewals coming up in not too distant future. We expect a positive result. It certainly helps that they are having a very, very strong ratings year. And we're in a good position to capitalize on that with our renewals.","Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Would you expect more of an affiliate fee stream internationally when you go out 3 to 5 years? I assume that you would.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Absolutely, we would. Our objective, of course, is to build a dual revenue stream business. It's not available in all markets, to be fair. It's either, some cases you get paid for the content, and it's very hard to build an ad business or the reverse. That's the fun of the International business. But we do expect that we'll get -- our objective is of course, to get the dual revenue stream wherever we can.","Operator","Then ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our Q&A session.

Welcome to the Scripps Networks Interactive 2014 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Executive Vice President and Chief Communications Officer, Mr. Mark Kroeger. Please go ahead.","Mark W. Kroeger","Thank you, Angela. Good morning, all, and thanks for joining us. On the call this morning is Ken Lowe, our Chairman, President and CEO; Joe NeCastro, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer; Burton Jablin, President of Scripps Networks; and Lori Hickok, Executive Vice President of Finance.","We'll start the conference call with prepared remarks that should take about 20 minutes, then we'll open it up for questions.","Let me remind you, if you prefer to listen in via the Internet, go to our website, click on the Investor button and find the microphone icon on the landing page. Additionally, on the page under the microphone icon, you'll find our first quarter earnings presentation materials that we'll be referencing during the prepared remarks portion of our call. An audio archive will be available on the site later today, and we'll leave it there for 2 weeks, so you can access it at your convenience. [Operator Instructions]","Let me remind you that our discussion this morning will contain certain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from those predicted, and some of the factors that may cause results to differ are set forth in our publicly filed documents, including our Form 10-K.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Ken.","Kenneth W. Lowe","All right. Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As always, I appreciate you joining us. We're off to a great start in 2014, driven by our unique lifestyle content, which attracts a highly engaged, upscale audience.","During the first quarter, the company delivered strong growth in advertising and affiliate revenues, positive audience trends at all of our networks and a growing contribution from our international businesses. Our concentration on the home, food and travel lifestyle categories and the world-class brands they represent stands apart from the other media choices.","Our networks are truly different, delivering quality lifestyle programming that outshines the competition on television, the expanding array of mobile video platforms and in magazines. Media consumers recognize the distinctive nature of our programming and they seek it out. Across all our platforms in the United States, 170 million people consume our content each month.","At Scripps Networks Interactive, we don't just have appointment viewing, we have appointment brands. And if you ask our viewers, they don't just watch shows. They watch networks. So this kind of viewer engagement means that all day parts and audience demographics are valuable to us and to our advertising partners. For example, in the first quarter of 2014, HGTV was the #1-rated cable network on the weekends for adults and women aged 25 to 54. And once again, it was the #1 network for weekend viewing among upscale adults in women in that age group. And this is a highly sought-after audience for advertisers.","Consumers also consider our networks to be trusted information sources. For example, in a recent study by Beta Research, viewers said they were more likely to buy products advertised on some networks than on others. Our networks held 4 of the top 8 positions on that important list, with DIY Network claiming the top spot. It was #1.","Beyond their appeal to viewers and advertisers, our networks are highly valued by distributors. For example, Cablevision recently agreed to carry, for the first time, both DIY Network and Cooking Channel. These brands are now available to approximately 3 million Cablevision customers in the most important market, New York. All of these peer-leading unique attributes are what sets Scripps Networks Interactive apart for viewers, for advertisers and for distributors alike.","Now let me turn the call over to Burton Jablin to underscore some of our network trends before we go to Joe and Lori to discuss financials. Burton?","Burton F. Jablin","Thanks, Ken. You already touched on some of the highlights, but let me just say our networks performed exceptionally well in the quarter, driving the company's stellar results. This positive momentum started in January. HGTV was the #1 rated cable network on New Year's Day. It was also a big social media day with an all-day Twitter party around HGTV's coverage of the Rose Parade. In fact, HGTV was one of the most popular topics on Twitter that day. Besides being the top weekend destination network in all of cable, HGTV is now the 11th highest-rated advertising-supported cable network among adults 25 to 54. That's up 3 spots from last year. Shows like Flip or Flop, Caribbean Life and Living Alaska, along with favorites such as House Hunters, Love It or List It and Property Brothers contributed to HGTV's strong audience growth.","The future looks bright for HGTV as well. I hope you saw our recent announcement that Ellen DeGeneres is going to produce and star in a show for us called Ellen's Design Challenge. She's a big HGTV fan and has a passion for furniture design, so it's a great fit.","DIY Network provided another great first quarter story. In addition to expanding its footprint on Cablevision, DIY Network completed its best quarter ever, with the average adult 25 to 54 audience up 25% over the first quarter of 2013. Rehab Addict, The Vanilla Ice Project, Rev Run's Renovation and Building Alaska helped drive the record growth.","Speaking of new shows, DIY Network will boldly go where no home improvement show has gone before starting this fall. We'll be following the legendary William Shatner as he renovates his California home in The Shatner Project. Great American Country also is generating viewer interest as the repositioning to a country lifestyle network progresses. In the first quarter, we saw primetime audiences grow more than 20% compared with year ago levels. Programs such as Farm Kings, Flea Market Flip and I Brake For Yard Sales helped drive record growth. Together, Great American Country and DIY Network represent some of the strongest year-over-year growth in all of cable.","Now over at Food Network where we've created one of the most widely known brands that influences all things food related. Even with intense competition from the Olympics, overall Food Network audiences were level with the prior year. Over the same period, weekend audience has realized mid-single digit growth, with the important demo of women aged 18 to 49 increasing 10% compared with last year's first quarter. Helping drive the improvement were new programs like Alton Brown's Cutthroat Kitchen, Guy's Grocery Games and Beat Bobby Flay.","Cooking Channel started 2014 strong, right where it left off in 2013. The network delivered its highest ever quarter and finished the period with its best March on record for adults and women 25 to 54. Programs like Unique Sweets, My Grandmother's Ravioli, Not My Mama's Meals and Unique Eats helped drive very strong audience growth. Both Food Network and Cooking Channel are off to a great start in 2014.","We're also seeing positive results in Travel Channel as we build a consistent viewing environment and focus on developing programs that reflect the desire to connect with people, places and cultures around the world. The network realized its best first quarter since 2001 for adults 25 to 54, and importantly, it was the highest-rated quarter ever for women 25 to 54. Weekends continued as a source of strength as viewing matched all-time network highs. We're also seeing more time spent viewing and frequency as we implement consistent scheduling across the week. A broad slate of programs helped drive this performance, including new seasons of Mysteries at the Museum, Hotel Impossible and Bizarre Foods America. We expect this positive momentum to continue with a host of new programming and episodes of successful returning series.","Internationally, we capped the first quarter with the launch of Fine Living Network in Italy. And speaking of Europe, audiences there find our lifestyle programming very appealing. Food Network is the most watched lifestyle channel in the U.K. and Travel Channel has grown its audience 60% over the past year.","In Asia, it's been about a year since we acquired Asian Food Channel. And in that time, we've managed to triple distribution in the region. What's more, we've successfully positioned ourselves as the food category leader in Southeast Asia.","In Latin America, we're working toward a network launch this summer as we look to repeat the success we've seen in Europe and Asia.","So overall, Scripps Networks Interactive is off to a great start in 2014, led by the global popularity of our lifestyle networks and driven by peer-leading operating results.","With that, I'll turn it over to Joe and Lori to discuss the financials.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to touch on first quarter highlights, and Lori will provide color on what drove our strong results before we open it up for Q&A.","Starting with the consolidated view. Driven by strong growth in advertising and affiliate fees, total revenue was up 8%. Total segment profit was up a healthy 9%. This reflects the strong revenue growth and lower-than-expected programming and marketing expenses in the quarter. Net income attributable to SNI was $0.87 per share. This reflects the growth in segment profit, coupled with the effects of our share repurchase program.","During the first quarter of 2014, we repurchased 3.1 million shares of stock for around $250 million. So overall, a great start to 2014 driven by strong growth in advertising and affiliate fees, coupled with lower-than-expected expenses and an increased use of the balance sheet through the share buyback program.","Now I'll turn the call over to Lori. She'll provide more detail and then discuss the drivers of these results. Lori?","Lori A. Hickok","Thanks, Joe. Looking at key revenue drivers for the first quarter, advertising was up 10% and affiliate fees were up 7% compared with last year. Advertising revenue growth in the first quarter was driven by strength in both the scatter and the 2013, '14 upfront market. Scatter versus scatter, CPM pricing, was up mid- to high-single digits year-over-year and up mid- to high-teens over the broadcast upfront.","For the advertising category, our top 5 were: food, financial, consumer packaged good, retail and auto.","So far in the second quarter, the advertising market is healthy. Second quarter scatter versus scatter pricing growth continues to run in the mid- to high-single digits and to mid- to high-teens over the 2013, '14 broadcast upfront.","Affiliate revenue grew 7% in the first quarter, driven by annual escalators in our affiliate agreements, digital distribution revenue and our international acquisition in April of 2013.","Looking at our network performance in the U.S. Revenues were up 7.6% on a strong advertising and affiliate fee growth. Our advertising revenues were up 9%, driven by the pricing increases I previously mentioned. Affiliate fee revenues were up 6%.","Lifestyle Media segment expenses were only up 4.5%. The lower-than-planned increase in expenses was due primarily to a decision to shift some programming premieres out of the first quarter. This also resulted in a corresponding delay in some marketing and promotional expenses. As a result, segment profit for U.S. networks was up a healthy 11% from the prior year period.","Included in the consolidated results, our international businesses generated $19 million of revenue in the first quarter. This was up 40% from the prior year, primarily due to the Asian Food Channel acquisition and growth in our existing international operations.","Additionally, our equity and earnings of affiliates was $22 million, up from $20 million last year. Our international partnerships in Canada and the United Kingdom comprised slightly more than half of equity earnings. Together, our proportionate share of international revenue from equity investments, coupled with our consolidated international operations, now equals almost 15% of revenue.","We have not updated our previously issued full year guidance. However, due to the inherent seasonality in our business model, which leads to fluctuations in our quarterly growth expectations, I'll provide some specific color on the second quarter. We expect total revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. Contributing to this, we expect advertising revenue growth in the high-single digits driven primarily by the continuing healthy advertising market we noted previously.","We expect affiliate revenues to increase in the low-single digits. For the second quarter, we don't have the benefit of the incremental digital distribution revenue as we did in the first quarter of 2014. Additionally, since we acquired Asian Food Channel in April 2013, we expect the positive comparisons from international operations to moderate in the second quarter.","On the expense side, cost of services is expected to increase in the midteens driven by the shift in program premieres from the first quarter into the second. Driven, in part, by the increase in marketing expenses related to the shift of program premieres, selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the mid-single digit range.","In total, for the second quarter, we expect consolidated expenses to increase in the low-double digits. The good news is that the second quarter will be the highest quarter of the year for expense growth, with subsequent quarters' expense growth rates trending downwards into the mid-single digit rates.","With that, we're ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Anthony DiClemente from the company of Nomura.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have 2 questions. First is, it sounds like, from your prepared remarks, that the second quarter scatter market that you're experiencing is a little bit healthier than maybe some of your media peers are seeing. And I just wonder, maybe this is a question for Lori. I'm just wondering, does this have to do with the endemic categories for the company and -- versus the non-endemic? Is that what it is? Or maybe it's a combination of ratings performance and that? And then, I have a second question. And maybe this is for Burton or whomever. You guys have talked a lot about -- I know Ken, in his prepared remarks, talked about being #1 in the category of affluent women, 18 to 49. And you have talked about weekend watching quite a bit. I'm just wondering, in the scheme of cable programming, if that target demographic is beginning to gain more importance or sort of take more mind share, if you will, in terms of brand marketers and their priorities on demos. Is that maybe another explanation for your general company stability on the ad side?","Lori A. Hickok","Okay, Anthony. Well, I'll take the first one as you suggested. But yes, you hit it. Part of the story is our endemics but also, as you will hear us repeat [ph] over and over and over is the quality audience that we deliver. We are a must-buy for advertisers, and that's why we do relatively better than our peers against market pricing. So you hit it on the spot. What I really will come back to is our brands, the appointment brands, the quality of our audience, the consistency and the predictability of what we put on the air.","Kenneth W. Lowe","And Anthony, the second part or the second question relates to the first. It is the quality of the audience, but specifically in the demo of women. And it's both demos, 18 to 49, and 25 to 54, there absolutely is an interest in women in the household, especially moms. The purchasing decisions being made by that particular group are known to be sort of where decisions are made in the household. So reaching them is really critical. And we reach probably the most attractive segment of that audience because they're affluent, they are paying attention to our ads, they're involved in our programming, they relate to our brands and they have money to spend.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, on that point, with your new addition of Cablevision with DIY, would that have any positive influence at all? I know you've got difficult comps from last year for the Asia network. But I guess I'm trying to get a sense of how meaningful that pickup will be.","Lori A. Hickok","Alexia, on the overall scheme, it's not a material amount. It definitely helped somewhat but I would not say material to the consolidated results, and something we would note. But it will help -- it's more eyeballs and more impressions over time. So it should have a positive impact as we look forward.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just a follow-up question. You gave some great color on the scatter market, which like Anthony noted, seems a bit more positive than what we've heard from others, which is great. Any color, I guess, on the upfront negotiations? I know you guys had your presentation a few weeks ago, and I know negotiations are still kind of early days. But does it feel any different than last year? I mean, if you can give us any color, that would be great.","Burton F. Jablin","Well, this is Burton, Alexia. The negotiations haven't begun yet, actually. We just finished our last of the big upfronts last week. There are continuing presentations being done at advertising companies around -- advertising agencies around the country. So that part continues. We, of course, had our Digital NewFront presentation last week. I can tell you this, that the reception to all of our presentations has been very positive. A lot of good buzz. A lot of sense that there's still much more great programming to come on our networks, which there is. Our story remains the same. We have a great audience. It's a premium audience. We sell for premium prices. So the ad sales team tells me that they're optimistic going into the negotiations which, of course, are still a few weeks away.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Do you see any real difference in sort of the advertiser's approach to how much they're putting versus the more traditional -- your traditional networks versus your new fronts?","Burton F. Jablin","Well, I mean, we've all read the talk that they're sort of looking at digital. But I think we'll wait and see when the negotiations really get down to business, where they're going to put their money. I mean we, of course, still feel that television is extremely strong. We also feel we have a great digital product. And we expect to be able to put the 2 together with our quality audience and get a very nice share of the dollars for both.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Alexia, this is Ken. I had a chance to attend several of the upfronts. And I think one of the things that we're seeing, to Burton's point, is not only the continued strong response to our traditional upfront, but the recognition, that's what we've been doing for years and that's delivering on a multi-platform basis. And I think we kind of stand out in that area. And as we blend to a new front, we're very bullish on just the TV upfront for some time to come. There will be some migration to upfront -- to NewFront, but I think that will be over time. We're already there, to a large degree, with a lot of the relationships we have with our clients on multi-platform. So for us, it's just more of the same. But to Burton's point, in several places, we've had record crowds and just excellent response. So let's hope that turns itself into another strong upfront.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov from Sterne Agee.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Ken, you said that you moved a couple of premieres out of Q1 into other quarters. But if I look at the ratings, it looked like ratings did just fine. I was wondering if you infer anything from this, whether maybe you could spend a little less on programming or something like that? And then another question I had, you mentioned that you're launching a network in Latin America, which has been highlighted by all your peers as a very fast-growing market and attractive. I was wondering if you could tell us if it's different for you, given your genre, to launch networks and find carriage and affiliate partners in Latin America? Why hasn't it been done before?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes. Vasily, let me -- Joe is closer to the international on a day-to-day basis. It all reports to him. We'll take that first -- that second question first. And then actually, I'd like Burton to weigh in on the premieres. All positive news on the premier side, by the way. But I think he can give more color. Joe, you want to talk about Lat Am?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Vasily, this is Joe. I'd say you're right to point out that it's a unique market. It's a very attractive market. It's a 2-language market, at least and 2 very important markets there, both Brazil and Mexico, to start. And then of course, some of the other Spanish-speaking markets behind them. We have spent a fair amount of time obviously studying the market before launching. They are well developed and, in some cases, protected markets. That is, big competitors with market share to protect. Our reception has been outstanding there. They love the content. There are other lifestyle channels in many markets. But nobody does the kind of quality programming that we do and nobody owns the formats that we own. Our programming has been seen in many of those markets through our licensing over the years and so that we know that there's a market for it and there is an appeal to it. And our commitment to launch in those markets with both U.S. programming adapted for the local market, and maybe reusing the formats with local talent and in local language is a very powerful combination for distributors. So we really expect that we'll have a successful launch sometime this summer. And the reception so far, especially among big distributors, has been very, very positive.","Burton F. Jablin","And on the program premier question, the shifting was done for a couple of reasons, partly, tactically, because the Olympics were on and we occasionally want to avoid some of the bigger events on the Olympics in competition. We also go directly against them with some of our networks depending on past performance in the Olympics. So that's all very tactical. Other reasons that we might shift, and did shift, is that the first quarter tends to be fairly strong anyway. Other quarters need more programming in order to compete. And so there -- I wouldn't read into that, any implication that we would be able to reduce programming expenses because we saw ratings performing fairly well even with the shift of some premiers.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Can you give us an update on where you stand on your new SVOD deal? So I think the Amazon deal is up after the first quarter. And then, where does your SVOD strategy stand in relation to your upcoming affiliate fee negotiations in TV Everywhere? So a little bit on that.","Burton F. Jablin","Well, it is true the Amazon deal expired. As we've said many times, it was a short-term trial agreement. And so we did learn from that -- from the relationship. And we learned that our content has value to digital consumers. And so, at this point, we are talking to other digital distributors. But we've got nothing to announce at this point.","In general, we always have a preference for models that allow us to monetize our content via advertising because our networks are such strong advertising platforms. And we think that that's true as well on the digital side. And we also have a bias toward being very good partners to our traditional distributors. And TV Everywhere is something that we believe in, have supported from the very beginning, have rolled out across more than 70% of our distribution footprint. And so we'll continue to work closely with our incumbent distributors on ways that we can work with them on the digital side as well","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","And can I just follow up, Burton, on your guidance for the year, are we assuming another SVOD deal? Or that's opened?","Burton F. Jablin","Lori will take that one.","Lori A. Hickok","We aren't currently, no. So there would be an upside if we would do something there. But again, I don't think it would have a material impact one way or the other unless it's the big deal that we announce later in the year. So we don't take that kind of liberty when we're setting guidance.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler from MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","I don't know if I missed it or not, but I wonder if you could talk about how much your digital revenue contributions were up from your own company-specific websites? And then, when you guys are starting to promote a little bit with your upfronts and NewFront, the ulive website, how do you sort of balance the ulive website with your own very robust network websites that are already there? How is it differentiated and how do you not confuse the advertisers and more particularly, the users of those sites and why they would go to ulive versus, let's say, FoodNetwork.com?","Burton F. Jablin","I'll take the second part of that question but give the first one to Lori.","Lori A. Hickok","Yes. When you look at our guidance, you actually do see the digital embedded in there. What we're seeing and what you\u2019re seeing, which is industry-specific, is that pressure on the display ad. So we're suffering some of that also, but because we have, again, those quality audiences, those quality brands, we're looking like it's going to be a lot more positive as we put our strategies together and move towards the back half of the year. But we are watching that programmatic impact on display banners, impact as us well as others. So it's a market influence that we're all trying to figure out. But we've got strong brands. And as you heard Burton talk earlier, when we went to the NewFront, they're very excited about what we're doing. We premiered some things that we're thinking and how we're doing convergent selling, and that's what Steve and his team have been doing for many, many years, is convergent selling on the digital front. And we're becoming more refined and focused on that selling point.","Burton F. Jablin","And Eric, this is Burton. It's a good question about the relationship of all of our digital platforms. The way we think of it is this way, our overall mission is to drive more video views of our content, just as we are trying to drive more video impressions on television. So we try to look at it holistically. Each of our branded websites has a particular way of relating to consumers, and they are intended to create a holistic brand experience that, in part, includes video. But if you take FoodNetwork.com or food.com, those have tremendous amounts of recipes, which are a key driver of traffic on those sites. For HGTV, it's photography, for example, of beautiful rooms and d\u00e9cor. So ulive is intended to be where we do some experimenting, even expand beyond our traditional home, food and travel categories. In video, as you know, we're now trying to do wellness, pets, kids. So it's a way for us to actually expand into more lifestyle without disrupting the clear focus of our brands, which is critical that we continue the consistent success we've had. So ulive, remember, as well it's 2 parts. It's a website and it's also a distributed network where we have partners and place video content throughout the Internet. And that's how we are going to -- and have been aggregating more and more video views. So we're looking at it holistically. Each piece represents part of the bigger puzzle, bigger picture. And hopefully, it will all come together with, as I said, a focus on driving more and more video views.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I always say you guys give more disclosure, I think, than anybody else in the peer group. And for me, like, no good deed ever goes unpunished. So I have to ask you, because the disclosure's so great. Look, you're one of the few who haven't really talked about an Olympic headwind while posting a really good number. So I guess my question is, I'm surprised you're not seeing more sequential acceleration. Are you seeing sequential acceleration because of that Olympic headwind? Or was it just like not a headwind at all? And then -- on 2Q versus 1Q ad growth. And then secondly, can you kind of give a x SVOD impact of 1Q year-over-year affiliate growth and then of 2Q expected? So that 4% -- was 4% because you didn't have the SVOD contribution. What's sort of the core affiliate growth?","Burton F. Jablin","Well, you're welcome on behalf of all of us, David. This is Burton. I'll tackle the first part of your question and Lori can look at the second part.","I referenced this sort of earlier, in an earlier answer, we've gotten pretty good at analyzing what the Olympics does to both our ratings and our ad sales. And so we're very tactical in our approach to the Olympics in any given quarter. And so to say that we expect that the Olympics themselves are going to impact how we view the rest of the year in any significant way, we've baked that in already. So I wouldn't say that we would tell you anything different from what we've already given in terms of guidance just because of the Olympics. And in terms of headwinds from the Olympics, as I said, because we can plan pretty well for them, we're pleased with the performance of our networks. Some were flat in the quarter, and that was the impact of the Olympics, expected. Some improved in the quarter in ratings, and that's because we found that some of our networks, we can actually program aggressively against the Olympics. And it's traditional counterprogramming, and it works. So Lori?","Lori A. Hickok","And David, back to your question on what would our distribution revenue year-over-year growth look for the back half or even for the remaining quarters, it's the low-single-digits. Just what we said in the script and in the guidance previously. So we did have the benefit in Q1 of the SVOD, and that's moderating as we go out. So that really is our traditional, with a little bit of help when you look at the consolidated from some of our international operations.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Laura Martin with Needham.","Laura A. Martin - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I sort of have 1 for each of you. So Ken, Vince McMahon over at WWE is doing really interesting things with an on over-the-top channel and his focus is U.S. But you really need a really deep library of fully-owned copyright like you guys have. Have you thought, as you're going offshore, about doing anything like, essentially, a linear channel but over-the-top with some of that wonderful on-demand deep library you have? I'm interested in your thoughts on over-the-top. I'm specifically interested from you, Lori, on margins. So one of the things we do in valuations is we really don't want to hit you guys for the losses on your international because we don't think that's value-destructive, so we want to add back the losses. So I'm wondering if you could parse through the guidance you've given and just tell me, like, magnitude, what the losses of international are that this SVOD rolling off isn't going to contribute [ph] because I'd like to add those back when I value you on an EBITDA basis? And then I guess, 1 last question is just on the structure of your sales force. Then NewFront presentations, you're right, were really, really highly attended this year. do you guys have a separate ad sales force for your digital? Or is it sort of bundled into the sales force that also sells linear, so by implication you're going to have more of your digital ad sales kind of as a -- in part of the bundle with linear ad sales or are those different sales forces?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Thanks, Laura. First off, you gave me a great opportunity to talk about over 35,000 hours of programming that we own and we have in our library. So we're constantly looking at ways, whether it's short-form, domestically utilizing it on ulive, on our own websites, just is how we can maximize the use of that library because I think, if you will, the world is coming to us. We believe from day 1 that the ownership of content long-term was of great value. And we're starting to see that. As far as offshore, I'll let Joe comment. But I was -- just spent some time in Asia, and we're seeing more and more opportunities. But you can imagine, it's a little complex relative to some of the deals that we have in place, how we structure the deals and what we want to get accomplished under the deals with our partners. And as you travel the world, the world is beginning to catch up with the States in how they're structuring deals as well. But Joe, do you want to comment, add further comment on it?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes, Laura, just 1 or 2 other thoughts. Our preference as we approach any market is to distribute through the traditional either cable or satellite operators because we find that that's the widest audience and maximizes the potential for revenue on both of the revenue streams. So that's usually our first play. There are absolutely markets where we think an over-the-top play would probably be our best route to market. But we sort of have our hands full looking at the opportunities before us on the traditional side. In some of those cases, we are looking at complementarity digital offerings. I wouldn't describe them exactly as over-the-top, but we are thinking about certain markets where that may be our first entry into the marketplace. So stay tuned.","Lori A. Hickok","And then back to your question on margins and valuation, what I would say, Laura, is really our investment strategy, we have a plan going into the year but we moderate that based on opportunities and different things that happen. But if you look at the core business, our margins are expanding and that's a little bit back to our cost controls on SG&A. So we're really looking at mid to -- actually, it's down, flat to down to even maybe low-single-digits on expenses on our core business. So I would say, from a valuation perspective, the core business is strong. We continue to drive the top line and we make smart, strategic decisions as we invest in international, and that can be through our balance sheet or could be organically through our income statement. And it's really hard to know as we look at opportunities and as Joe and his team go around the globe looking for what to do. And as well as these multiplatform opportunities. We continue to look at opportunities, but nothing huge there. And if there was any acquisition-type things, we'd probably be talking about that anyway. So hopefully that gives you a little color to your question on valuation.","Burton F. Jablin","And Laura, this is Burton. Thank you, by the way, for the observation about our Digital NewFront. It was a great event. I was there. It was very exciting. We do have a separate digital sales force headed by Beth Lawrence, but sales -- the digital sales force works hand-in-hand with our on-air ad sales force, headed by Jon Steinlauf and under the direction of Steve Gigliotti. The whole thing is, and the whole focus, is multiplatform. We have television. We have digital. We have, of course, print, which we saw in conjunction with our partners at Hearst. And in the Digital NewFront, for example, pretty much every video we showed in connection with our television brands was an offshoot of a television series that's a digital-only video so that we can sell it in a convergent package with the television program. And so that is not new for us. We've been doing this for a long time. And so while we do have a dedicated digital sales force, it is part of a holistic approach to selling multiplatform.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Joyce with International Strategy & Investment Group.","David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of more on the international side. On the new Lat Am launch, is that contemplated to be all affiliate fees or will there be some advertising component to that? And more broadly, on your international growth strategy, how is that altered with the change in ownership at Chello?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Thanks, David. This is Joe. The launch in Lat Am is meant to, over the long haul, be a dual revenue stream business. I think early on, we're very much focused on getting launched with the biggest distributors and getting fees. And then hopefully, as we expand viewership there, we will be able to develop an ad sales business as well. So we are hoping to replicate the U.S. dual revenue stream model in as many markets as we can, and certainly Latin America is no exception. With respect to the international growth strategy, the change in ownership at Chello really has very little to do with our plans. It's not to say that there weren't some attractive assets in that portfolio, and we did spend a fair amount of time looking at it. I don't think it's any secret. I think any of the domestic players that have international aspirations did kick the tires with that. But there's nothing in that portfolio that we don't think we can replicate and do on our own in some of the markets. So I don't think it has a material effect on us. I do think it was an asset of scale, which is why people were attracted to it and looked at it. But it was a collection of things, some of which fit with our plans and some of which didn't. So we could never get to the value that the asset ultimately traded for.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions on digital distribution of content and your content. One, it seems like the major SVOD partners, primarily Netflix and Amazon, are paying less or are less interested in paying for nonfiction content. And I'm curious as to whether you would agree that that's a fair characterization. And perhaps, why your content seems to work so much better on linear channels than it does on an SVOD platform? And then secondly, I know it's still a nascent business, but if you look at sort of linear digital distribution, let's use YouTube as an example, there's a lot of incremental investment in developing content for those platforms. Can you just talk about your -- what you're seeing in the competitive environment in your genres in those types of platforms, and how you're positioning yourself for that competition?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, Michael, it's a fair observation. But I think if you look at it from the other side, 94% of the viewing to our networks is live. We, in some cases and you've probably heard me say this before, we act as our own syndication model. Those statistics that I we gave you earlier about weekend viewing, it's 24\/7 as a brand. People watch our networks continuously. So the type of binge-viewing that you're seeing more and more of, I think on the Amazons and the Netflix, it doesn't occur as much because when people watch our brands, they stay for long periods of time. And that's the great reason that we can attract the high level of audience that we do. And I don't think it has that much to do with the value of our content. More importantly is the advertising component. We can make a lot more money selling our own content with advertising as opposed to stripping out the advertising and just doing some SVOD deals. So I think it's more about the value of our content, how we view it, how we want to sell it, how we want to position it. And I think it's going to consistently be the case that entertainment and fiction will probably be more at the forefront of what they're creating in their models. Burton, anything to add to that?","Burton F. Jablin","Well, just that if you look at television ratings in general, entertainment and scripted programming get higher ratings than most lifestyle and nonfiction programming. And so why wouldn't that be replicated in the SVOD universe as well? That said, we were pretty pleased with the play rate of our programming on Amazon. We saw no indication that our content wasn't as popular in that format or that venue as it is on television. So as far as what those distributors would want to pay to nonfiction players like us or scripted, I guess that would be up to them to respond. And on YouTube, we view it as a very good marketing platform. We have content on YouTube. It's aimed at audiences that we think are going to be looking at lifestyle content on YouTube. As far as a moneymaker, that's a little tougher. And so we view it mainly as an outreach, an audience outreach form -- location for us and our video content. And competition, there are all kinds of videos in lifestyle categories on YouTube. I think we'll stand by the success of our -- the performance of our video content both on our networks and digitally in terms of quality and the kinds of audiences we attract and the way that we can monetize that through our dual revenue stream. We like that ecosystem very much.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Just one more item of color there. We don't ignore it, we absolutely understand the attractiveness of especially short-form content on these other platforms. That's part of the justification behind our investment in ulive, on the one hand. And we do have relationships and ongoing dialogue with some of the larger players in the lifestyle space on the ulive platform -- on the YouTube platform. So we continue those discussions. And we try to learn from it as much as we can and reflect it on our own product offerings.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Question for anyone that wants to answer. But you guys have been very consistent over the years about your ability to sort of command premiums in the ad market, and your results have sort of shown that. And my question is, how would you suggest to those of us on the outside how we can gauge how long that can continue, right? It can't continue in perpetuity where you grow your ad dollars faster than your ratings. So when -- as you guys think about it internally, how long can this go on?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Jason, with all due respect, I think it can go in perpetuity because if you go back 20 years ago, this is how the company was put together. It was about attracting upscale women. This was the plan from day 1. So we've been doing it for 20 years. Can we do it for another 20 years? Absolutely. Does it get more difficult as the world becomes more fragmented and more people -- more competitors come after this very valued demographic, psychographic? Absolutely. But as we said consistently, it's all about understanding and connecting with the audience. And we've been fortunate in that from day 1, we had a call center where we connected with the audience. We've got this, as you heard earlier, this trust that we have with the audience. And I think as long as we continue to stay in touch with them, stay in sync with them, where they're going, what devices they're going to be using our content on, what they want, to Burton's point earlier, very much why we're experimenting with things like ulive. I think our business model is very solid for a long, long time.","Operator","And our next question is coming from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sticking on the scene with international and with all the M&A in the air, my question, Joe, is as you travel the globe racking up frequent flier miles, I'm wondering if you're looking at some production assets. With the trade today with All Media, Eyeworks and Time Warner, seems like a part of the ecosystem that's growing in value given all the increased demand for content. It's historically probably not something you've spent maybe a ton of time on. And -- but I'm curious if you think that's something that would allow Scripps to create value for shareholders with that asset? I guess either inside or outside the U.S. but I'm probably more focused on international opportunities where production seems to be, at least right now, a pretty hot area for investment.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Ben, obviously those announcements don't go unnoticed. And we are aware of that level of activity in the markets that we happen to be in. I would say it would be more beneficial to a company with a much larger footprint at this point. And I think in due time, it will make some sense. We believe that our library makes a huge difference for us. And one of the things we'd love to do is just take advantage of the content that we already own and the formats that we already own rather than to give into the production business. We've never done that in the States. We're very, very successful at getting programming and owning all the rights and being able to exploit those rights. So we're going to continue the same model. If we get to the point in any particular market or region where we think that it makes economic sense for our shareholders, we'll certainly get more active in that space.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That makes sense. And then just as a follow-up on sort of the cost side in the lifestyle area, everyone is also pouring money into scripted drama, serialized stuff. And you can see the cost numbers going up all around us. I'm wondering if that actually puts you guys in a little bit of an advantaged position being not necessarily niche, but sort of focused in an area of programming that you've got a long position of incumbency and maybe there isn't as much incremental competition. I know, Ken, you would never say you're not in a competitive market but at least as it relates to the second derivative, it does seem like an area where people are a little less focused on pouring money into versus scripted original dramas that run more expensive.","Burton F. Jablin","This is Burton. The quick answer is yes, we do feel that we continue to have that advantage. We've had it from the very beginning of the network when we started HGTV 20 years ago. We're doing programming at a fraction of the cost of other programming, including nonfiction programming that was then on the air. That continues to be true today. I wouldn't say it's necessarily a fraction like it was back then because there is more competition for lifestyle and for production companies' efforts. But we still think there is a cost advantage vis-\u00e0-vis scripted and the competition for really strong scripted ideas. So the premise of your question we certainly agree with.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, Ben, and I think going back to the previous question, we just have to keep raising the bar. DIY Network had the best quarter in its history in first quarter. And now we're getting an additional distribution. We just mentioned in the Cablevision deal for that network. In some cases, we've created a little bit of our own competition. When we added DIY to HGTV at Home category, and when we added the Cooking Channel to the Food Network and GAC is becoming more and more a complement to -- Great American Country's becoming more and more a complement to all of our networks. So there's no rest for the weary. There are a lot of smart competitive people out there. We're not the only ones that understand this is a valued demographic. So we just have to keep at our A game. And thanks to Burton and his incredible team and Brooke and Kathleen and Shannon, that's happening. So -- but it's -- you got to deliver. You got to deliver every day and you got to keep improving. And we will.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I remain very interested in the Travel Channel. And Burton, I was hoping you might be interested and willing to share some of your thoughts with us. And I guess I would just say, I know you have high aspirations, I believe you still do, for where that channel can get to now that it has found a permanent home. And from your prepared remarks, it sounds like you feel happy with the progress you're making. But I can't help but point out, and as you disclosed the revenue, at least and assign it to different networks, it actually had the lowest, I think, reported revenue growth that leads in the quarter among all your networks. And the ratings, at least as we track them, are fine. But they're not necessarily as obvious. Maybe we're not slicing it the way just to see maybe there's growth there, too. So is everything on track? What gives you the confidence that you -- that this can get where you thought you would get it?","Burton F. Jablin","Well, thanks, Todd, those are good observations and I'm happy to talk about them. Just a reminder that HGTV and Food Network's success, while they seem to be a given now, were actually many years in the making. And yes, Travel Channel has a great home with us and -- but we also believe it's a multiyear process. We've talked about that. The team that Shannon O'Neill, who was just named President of the network, has at Travel Channel, has been hard at work to develop what is the key to their success as it is for all of our networks. And that's content that we believe is very clearly targeted to our great demographic that we have on other networks, an educated upscale audience. And so that content is in the works now. We'll start to get on the air the new programming beginning at the end of this year and into 2015. As for the revenue number, I would just give you a reminder that Travel Channel has, in ad revenue, outperformed its ratings over a number of quarters previously. And so there's a little bit of catch-up going on. In addition, I would say that there is a lag between when ratings will start to show some improvement, especially in some key demographics, and when the ad revenue catches up. So we hope to see that as we get the fresh programming on the air. And within the rating itself, I think you're correct to say you're not seeing major pickup in percentage growth. Let's remember, we had the Olympics, but let's also remember that we're looking within those numbers to see things like the quality of the audience, that's very critical to us; and we're seeing improvement in median income, which is a nice sign. We also want to see greater stability in the -- on the network night-to-night, which we are beginning to see because of scheduling changes. And then we have to see what happens when we start putting the fresh content on the air. So I hope that gives you a little more insight into what we're seeing going on there.","Operator","And our last question is coming from the line of Ben Mogil with Stifel.","Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Just curious, as you now look to do a new SVOD deal, should we sort of infer from that, that whatever ratings impact was there or not there, you felt pretty comfortable with? And sort of does that give you the ability, if you will, maybe to go to a larger platform, i.e. Netflix, which may pay you more because you feel that the ratings impact was more manageable? I know you had talked earlier that Amazon's traction when you did the deal was, it was a more smaller universe and therefore, the impact would be sort of more measurable, if you will. Curious what your thoughts are around that.","Burton F. Jablin","Yes. This is Burton, Ben. We were certainly absolutely satisfied with the impact or lack thereof on the television ratings. We didn't see that as an issue. And any deal we might do in the future would be based on more factors than that. I mean, it would obviously be based on the finances and whatever the terms are in terms of advertising, for example, on some of the platforms and where we would see it might have an impact on our incumbent partners and our relationships with them. So it'd be more than just that 1 factor as we contemplate a deal with any other potential SVOD distributor.","Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And Burton, just sort of as a follow-up to that, when you were looking at -- did Amazon share any kind of ratings data with you or anything that you thought was really interesting, a couple of shows that maybe hasn't done great on broadcast but were really doing much better on Amazon, kind of curious if there was anything you gleaned from there that was interesting to you guys?","Burton F. Jablin","We looked at data and research from them, but honestly, for competitive reasons, I'd prefer not to give any detail on that. We were happy with what we saw, I would leave it at that.","Mark W. Kroeger","Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for your questions and participation. Angela, you can read the replay instructions.

We have another solid quarter under our belts, building on the momentum that we've created with our extraordinarily powerful and ubiquitous lifestyle television networks. Our shareholders are benefiting from the unique competitive advantage that we've carved out for ourselves in the media landscape. Our family-friendly networks in the home, food and travel content categories are extremely popular with viewers of all ages, but they particularly appeal to upscale women who watch our programming live. That makes all 6 of our television networks remarkably attractive marketing platforms to the broadest range of prestigious premier advertisers, all of whom know, without a doubt, that their commercial messages will be seen and acted upon by the most engaged and upscale audience in all of television.","It's a winning combination that's tough, I might even say impossible, to beat.

And now, we're successfully exporting that expertise and competitive advantage across the globe.","Now this is a company that's growing and on the move. It's a company committed to creating value for its shareholders. And we do that by doing what we do best.","For example, we just completed another peer-leading advertising upfront. We achieved solid mid single-digit CPM increases, and for the third consecutive year, we booked $1 billion in business, just an outstanding record. Huge props, by the way, to our ad sales team, led by Steve Gigliotti and Jon Steinlauf. They prove year in and year out they're the best in the business. And their success in this year's upfront is proof positive that our brand of lifestyle video content stands far apart from the crowd.","We have a unique place in popular culture. We set trends and we define a world's conversation about home, food and travel. It really doesn't get any better than that. So now let me turn the call over to Burton Jablin, who will underscore some of our network trends and highlights before we go to Joe and Lori to discuss financials. Burton?","Burton F. Jablin","Thanks, Ken. And you're absolutely right. All of our networks proved during the second quarter that they continue to be immensely popular with audiences in just about every daypart.","Starting with the home category, which includes HGTV and DIY Network, it's safe to say that things are good at home. The second quarter was a record breaker for both brands. HGTV finished the quarter ranked fourth in primetime among all ad-supported cable networks for women 25 to 54. That was up 2 positions from last year and our best quarterly finish.","In adults 25 to 54, we closed the quarter at #8, also 2 slots higher than last year. HGTV continues to dominate cable on weekends, ranking as the #1 network among women 25 to 54. More than 14 million viewers watched HGTV each weekend during the 3-month period, helping the network achieve its highest rated second quarter. And HGTV enjoyed an exceptional June, setting records for both primetime and weekends. Our new show, Flip Or Flop, has been a huge hit and recently led the network to its highest-rated Tuesday night. Another new show, Fixer Upper, has already been seen by more than 19 million viewers since its April premiere and is posting double-digit ratings gains for its time slot over last year. And viewers can't get enough of all things House Hunters. House Hunters Renovation, now in its third season, is achieving its highest ratings yet.","Over at DIY Network, the second quarter was the second best in networks -- in the network's history for adults in primetime, and that was just below the record set in this year's first quarter. DIY Network also was particularly strong among men.","Second quarter brought the best ratings week in DIY Network history among adults, and the weekend of May 31 also tied for the network's highest-rated weekend ever. Airings of Lake Life and Barnwood Builders contributed to the success. Other top-performing programs included Rehab Addict, The Vanilla Ice Project, Holmes Inspection and Decked Out.","Now a word or 2 about Great American Country. We made a strategic shift a few months ago and tucked the network in with our home category group. The home team jumped at the opportunity to program the network, and thanks to their creativity and enthusiasm, there have been really nice results there. The adults 25 to 54 audience grew 19% year-over-year, which made Great American Country one of the fastest growth stories among all ad-supported cable networks. Much of the programming drawing new viewers is lifestyle content, borrowed or re-purposed from the Scripps' library, which is an excellent use of our extensive programming archive.","Shows contributing to the second quarter's audience growth included Flea Market Flip and Junk Gypsies, which attracts the most upscale audience for the network. So some positive momentum at Great American Country.","Over at Food Network, we're finding new and younger fans, thanks to our growing team of high-profile, high-energy, on-air personalities and next-generation breakout hits. Simply put, Food Network continues to dominate in the food lifestyle space, delivering the best programming in the genre 24\/7. Food Network finished second quarter as the #11 rated network in primetime in all of cable, driven by shows like Food Network Star, Chopped Tournament of Stars and Worst Cooks in America.","For the first half of the year, adult 25 to 54 primetime ratings were even with 2013, while other demos were up. In total day, we were up in women and younger viewers. We're building on the success of several recent primetime hits, including Cutthroat Kitchen, Guy's Grocery Games and Beat Bobby Flay. Our In the Kitchen, day time and weekend block, showed nice gains in all demos, particularly among women. The strength of In the Kitchen helps us identify and establish new stars and provides an effective marketing platform for primetime.","We've seen growth among younger viewers, allowing us to appeal to advertisers on multiple demographic fronts. Food Network viewers are also watching longer than ever, which underscores engagement.","Our other network in the food category had a great quarter as well. Cooking Channel posted its best primetime ratings, up 4% in adults and up 5% in women. The audience continues to get younger at cooking, and we're attracting more women.","One of our new series, Rev Run's Sunday Suppers, was the network's top primetime program. So Cooking Channel is clearly one of our big success stories.","At Travel Channel, we continue to make steady progress in establishing brand identity and reaching an upscale audience. Solid results from programs like Bizarre Foods America, Hotel Impossible and Xtreme Waterparks contributed to the quarter's growth. The loyalty factor is growing at Travel Channel, with 16% year-over-year growth in the number of nights viewed and continued growth in time spent viewing. Median income, a key measure of audience quality, was up 6% year-over-year to almost $58,000. And viewers of Hotel Impossible, one of Travel Channel's most popular returning series, reported a median income of $74,000.","Appealing to an upscale audience is a Scripps trademark, that's why we have the #1 network group for reaching high-income viewers and one of the reasons we outperform in ad sales. We're very encouraged by the progress the team is making at travel and we expect to see more.","On the international front, during the second quarter, we launched Food Network and Fine Living in The Netherlands, Belgium, Slovakia and the Czech Republic; and Fine Living in Croatia, and soon we'll add Food Network and Fine Living in Hungary.","In Asia, we launched the Asian Food Channel in Taiwan and Vietnam, and we're still on schedule for a major network launch in South America. Audience reception in global markets continues to exceed expectations. For example, Travel Channel just won the U.K. Freesat Award as the Best Specialist Channel, beating some stiff competition including last year's winner, our very own Food Network U.K. So another great quarter's performance for Scripps Networks Interactive, driven by the global popularity of our lifestyle networks and peer-leading operating results.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe and Lori to discuss the financials.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Great. Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. So all those positive audience trends you just mentioned drove another good quarter for the company and for its shareholders. Results for the 3-month period were right in line with the expectations we outlined during our first quarter earnings call.","Consolidated revenue was up 6.5%, driven by strong growth in both advertising and affiliate fee revenue. Total company expenses were up 13%, and were generally in line with our expectations, with one notable exception. We took the opportunity in the quarter to spend about $10 million for the early termination of service agreements for our London-based operations. We expect this investment over the long term to give the company and its shareholders all the upside from our rapid expansion in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.","Now excluding the impact of that one-time international expense, earnings per share would have been about $1.14 versus $1.07 we reported this morning. It's also worth noting that earnings per share got a lift from our share repurchase activity during the period. We repurchased 4 million shares at a total cost of around $300 million.","Now with that, I'll turn it over to Lori who's going to drill down into the results and comment on our outlook for the balance of the year. Lori?","Lori A. Hickok","Thanks, Joe. Looking at key revenue drivers for the second quarter. Consolidated advertising was up 7.6% and affiliate fees were up 4.5% compared with last year. This advertising performance was consistent with our expectations of high single-digit advertising growth. The affiliate revenue growth was a bit stronger than we had anticipated.","Advertising revenue growth in the quarter was driven by the strength in the scatter and the 2013, '14 upfront market in the U.S. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing was up mid to high single digits year-over-year and up mid to high teens over the broadcast upfront.","As for advertising categories, our top 5 were food, retail, home improvement, consumer packaged goods and financials. Here, the biggest change was in home improvement, which was up significantly; and autos, which was down and dropped out of our top 5 categories.","So far in the third quarter, the advertising market remains healthy. Third quarter scatter-versus-scatter pricing growth is pacing in the mid to high single digits and in the mid to high teens over the 2013, '14 broadcast upfront. As Ken indicated, in the just completed upfront, we once again finished right at the top of our cable peers, with solid mid single-digit increases in CPM pricing. Our success in the upfront speaks to the desirability of our lifestyle networks as valued programming in marketing environments with highly engaged viewers who are passionate about food, home and travel.","Affiliate fee revenues grew 4.5% in the second quarter, driven by the annual escalators in our affiliate agreements, the increased distribution from Cooking Channel and the DIY Network and our international expansions.","Looking at our network performance in the U.S., revenues were up 6% on the strong advertising and affiliate fee growth. Our domestic advertising revenues were up 6.5%, driven by the pricing increases I previously mentioned. Affiliate fee revenues were up 4%.","Lifestyle Media segment expenses were up 7.6% and as expected, Cost of Services was up 11% as we premiered more programming during the quarter. The increase in premiers also contributed to an increase in marketing and promotions expense. And as a result, segment profits for U.S. networks was up 5% from the prior year period.","Included in the consolidated results, our international businesses generated $20 million of revenue in the second quarter. This was up 15% from the prior year, primarily due to the expanded distribution and growth in our existing international operation. Additionally, our equity and earnings of affiliates was $27 million, up 7% from last year. Our international partnerships in Canada and the United Kingdom comprised slightly less than half of equity earnings. Together, our proportionate share of international revenue from equity investments, coupled with our consolidated international operations, equals almost 15% of revenue.","Just to remind you, we are reiterating our previously issued full year guidance. However, due to seasonality, I'll provide some specific comments on the remainder of the year. I'd also remind you that our guidance is based on consolidated results, including international. We expect advertising, affiliate fee and total revenue growth to be in the mid single-digit range for both the third and fourth quarter, driven by the pricing factors discussed earlier on the call.","On the expense side, based on current programming schedules, we expect consolidated expenses to increase in the low double-digit range in the third quarter and low single-digit range in the fourth quarter.","And with that, we're ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I just -- Lori, you just mentioned mid single-digit growth for advertising for the second half. I'm just trying to reconcile that with your previous guidance, which I think was for high single-digit ad revenue growth at the lifestyle segment for the full year. So when I think about that properly, can you get to the previously high single-digit ad revenue with mid singles for the back half?","Lori A. Hickok","Yes, we're still -- as we said, we're reiterating our full year guidance, so we're comfortable with that and that's why we didn't make a change, Anthony, so...","Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And Ken, just a bigger question. When you look around at the themes here on consolidation in the space, can you just give us your view where Scripps fits in? And internationally, I think, Burton talked a little bit about the organic growth in terms of new network launch. Are there other opportunities internationally for Scripps, maybe an opportunity to go on the offensive, a la what you've done with the Travel Channel? And then I have one more follow-up for Joe, if I may. Go ahead, Ken.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Okay, yes. On the bigger question, Anthony, look, I think as today's results demonstrate, our targeted brands are really must-have channels that deliver an upscale audience, that really bodes well for the future of our content on all platforms. So for us, it's really about quality over quantity. We are great partners and highly valued by our distribution providers when it comes to local advertising. We're right at the top of the heap. So as the world moves more and more to potential consolidation, we think our networks and our company is going to play very well just as we are currently comprised. So we're very comfortable in moving forward in this environment. And to your second part of your question on international, actually Joe's got a little bit of breaking news on some of the international stuff that's going on, some very good signs, especially, I think just the recent launch in Italy. But the short answer is yes. I think there are tremendous opportunities. Joe and I were just in Asia. We got incredible feedback there about the home -- our home category, food category, there are lifestyles that fit very well in that part of the world. Partnerships are popping up everywhere and we see enormous opportunity. Joe, anything you want to add on that?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Anthony, as you know, we've just taken a sort of multifaceted approach internationally, and there's not really one size that fits all. So we have been working very diligently, and I think, to use your phrase, sort of have gone on the offensive on a number of fronts. We've talked about our desired markets, the ones that are our highest priority and in each of those markets, we're working on either launches or joint ventures or potential acquisitions. So there's -- I think there'll be plenty of news to come on that front. So -- and we're really pleased with the way things have gone so far.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And one quick follow-up. Just Joe, it looks like your average purchase price on the buyback was $75. How sensitive is the buyback to the share price? And is it a dollar volume target over the course of the quarter, or is it a price-sensitive mechanism that you have in place?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes, it's more the latter, Anthony. We do watch the price. We are -- obviously, we're going to remain active. We feel good about where we are with the program and where we are with our discipline on that at the moment. But we're going to continue to be active. And we're not talking about a program that turns off completely or turns on at different price points. We're just talking about scale.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Ken, you've always over-indexed the industry on the ad front, but the gap this quarter seems to have widened. And so is that a function of the recovery in ratings, or maybe are you better monetizing dayparts outside of prime?","Kenneth W. Lowe","It's a really good question, John, because we are, and thanks for pointing that out, over-indexing. I really think it's the advertising market coming more and more to us. Look, there's no question that Burton, sitting here to my left, and his team have been delivering some really strong ratings in food and home and garden as you heard in some the things that Burton was talking about in the script, these were top 10 networks. And especially, the engaged upscale audience that we're delivering is highly, highly valued by the advertisers. And I think as we turn more and more to a qualitative, accurate audience measurement, our brands and our lifestyle audience that we deliver becomes even more valuable. So this is the way we've been set up. This is why I say I'm confident about our future going forward even in a world that may even become more consolidated because we're targeted, we're in the right niches -- actually, to say they're niches is probably understating it a bit, in categories that are highly lucrative and we deliver the audience that advertisers are after. So my expectation's that we're going to continue to not only outpace our peers but become even more valuable to the advertising community as we get better audience information going forward, which we will do as an industry and across all platforms.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Maybe a related question. The comments around the third quarter seem, on the ad front, seem much more bullish than your peers. Are you seeing any kind of major acceleration in the domestic ad market? Is it category exposure? What do you think is going on? Or I mean, when you say -- I guess, what are you seeing?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Well, look, John. I think you've heard from enough of our peer group about the advertising market. I think it goes back to your previous question. We're just over delivering. And by the way, this is not just this quarter. I mean, go back and look, I gave credit to Steve Gigliotti and Jon Steinlauf and our sales team. It's not just about selling spots and commercials. It's about selling concepts. It's about partnerships. You've heard me say before our Dream Home giveaway is the most successful not only contest promotion in all of television but it's highly valuable to our advertisers. So it's just more of the same. I think we over-index, we'll continue to over-index. And no, I don't think we're seeing anything different. It's just out there kicking and scratching and calling and doing a better job.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of -- from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. The first one's on the Travel Channel. You guys have done such a great job in improving that channel. I guess, where are you, I think, versus where you hope to ultimately be. I guess what inning sort of are you in there? And then my second question is just on the SVOD. Are you still in active discussions, or do you think there's still a possibility that you would see a new deal on the SVOD side?","Burton F. Jablin","Alexia, it's Burton. Thanks, first of all, for your comments on the Travel Channel. I'm really pleased with the team there, Shannon O'Neill and Ross Babbit and the whole group of people are working very hard to turn Travel Channel into what we think is one of our best growth opportunities, and that's doing it the Scripps Networks way, by building a solid audience, consistency across the network schedule, a slate of new programs that will be coming on beginning in the fourth quarter and into 2015 that really reflect what we want that channel to be, a channel that looks at the world with great curiosity, a spirit of adventure and fun and intrigue. And I was just with them on Tuesday, I'm there quite often, and went through a number of these new shows, and I can tell you that I'm more excited than ever about our prospects. But I would say we're building it out for the long term and an important part of that is building the kind of audience there that we've enjoyed at our other networks: an upscale audience, high median income, educated. And we've seen within the ratings, which are relatively even with last year, but underneath that, we're seeing improvement, as I mentioned, in the median income, in the consistency of viewing, there are great signs of improvement there. So yes, I feel very bullish about it. On SVOD, yes, we're still looking to do another deal in that area, and we're working hard to be able to have something to announce on that sometime in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Morris with Guggenheim Securities.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of questions on your digital businesses. One, the digital line item within the network segment was down in the quarter, and I'm wondering if you could just give us a little color on what -- why it was down and sort of what the trend is, what the potential for that part of the business is. And then more broadly on your digital businesses, the ones that are contained in the corporate and other segment, can you talk about what you've learned from some of the investments that you've made, CityEats, for example? And just given the success that you have in your categories on TV, are there some opportunities to maybe partner with some established digital players and maybe get some more synergies there versus trying to build your own businesses within food or home and garden or travel?","Burton F. Jablin","Great questions. It's Burton. I'll answer a couple of those. First of all, in our core businesses, like other parts of the industry, we're seeing some headwinds from programmatic buying, decline in banner advertising and increased page for use [ph] for mobile devices, which are just harder for everybody to monetize, including us. So we are facing that. We are adjusting and as I think you've seen, uLive, which is not included in the core business, it is separate, but at some point, we will include it in the core because it's past its startup days. But uLive is a response to that, to the demand for more inventory in video, for more inventory in mobile, and we're seeing some nice revenue growth there. So yes, some headwinds, but we're adjusting. And our sales team in this upfront did a number of convergent deals where we bring in digital dollars in addition to our television dollars. And as a network group, I think we're about as well positioned as anybody to capitalize on those kinds of convergent deals. On the more corporate aspects, I mentioned uLive, I'll let Joe talk about CityEats and then maybe I can come back and answer about partnerships.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Sure, absolutely. Thanks, Mike. Look, I think we have a -- we are a learning organization and we have always been willing, over the years, to put some money at work in new ideas and new businesses and take some sort of measured gambles. And I'd say CityEats fits well within that. I think the learnings there have to do with what are we particularly good at and where should we be spending our energy and our investment dollars. I think we learned a lot from that experience about the applicability of our own brands as opposed to trying to develop new brands in, say, in the restaurant space. And while that area is adjacent to food, it is a very different business, and as you know, it has a dominant provider of the reservations business. So I think that was just one of those considerations. We went back and as you know, we review these routinely, we went back and just decided, given all the other priorities of the organization, that was probably not one that we were willing to continue to spend against since we had some other things that we thought were more promising and closer to the core of what we do. So I think that's probably been the major learning from that. I think I'll start the last piece of this and I'll turn it over to Burton, too. But as we go forward, we certainly believe that we should continue to put money to work and we're going to look at investment opportunities where we are not necessarily the majority investor or the owner of a business, but rather sort of a very interested party and observer and with the potential to do -- to make investments in areas where we think our assets can contribute to the success of the ventures. So a combination of the resources we bring and maybe some capital in some either investments, minority investments or maybe even some partnerships.","Burton F. Jablin","And then in looking at our success on TV and carrying that over. Our #1 goal is absolutely to increase the number of impressions for our video content, both long and short form. And we do like the idea of opportunities with partners. In fact, uLive is kind of based on that. It's a distributed network, we distribute our video content through partnerships with other digital entities, and that's proving a very nice business for us right now. So yes, we're very open to things like that.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Ken, I have a big picture question for you, and it's again about the M&A speculation in the space. You're a category leader and you've gone through a couple of processes in the past several years, where you had a material ramp and a fluid revenue [ph] at Food Network, but you also had -- you acquired Travel Channel. So I was wondering the common argument that scale helps the conversations, vis-\u00e0-vis MSOs, do you share that view bulking up in the same category? Does it really drive your leverage? And then if you could also talk about -- if that -- if bulking up happened in another category, not in the lifestyle, but descriptive [ph] programming, how would that affect your position with distributors?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, I think, Vasily, we've kind of always been an underdog for 20 years now from the beginning when people didn't have much faith in our ability to build HGTV into a quality brand or food into a quality brand. And from day 1, we've really been about sticking to our knitting: nonfiction, targeted, quality content that is highly engaging and viewed pretty much on a live basis. There's been plenty of this written. It's been documented that our viewership is over C3 is 94% live. So our game plan, our blueprint, if you will, is probably more viable and valuable today than it was 20 years ago. And going forward, to me, this is all about quality. This is all about must-have. I was recently told by -- she'll be nameless, a distributor, \"Ken, I could never drop any of your networks because my wife and my daughter would kill me.\" I think the fact that all of this consolidation we get caught up in just putting everything together and therefore, size and scale are going to become more important. It's never been true in any industry. Quality, quality brands, consumer engagement and really, ringing the cash register for the advertisers is what's going to win ultimately. So I'll put our 6 brands out there against any, and I think we can negotiate going forward and very successfully. So I think we're in great stead going forward. And as far as scripted, my view, one person's is, that is becoming more of a commodity because it's not as measurable from a standpoint of everything that I talked about in delivering audience as we do. So the more scripted, the more money that goes to that, whether it's on broadcast or cable, the more competition, the more important it is, I think, about the quality of audience that you're delivering. So hope that answers your question.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","It does, very helpful. One follow-up. Hypothetically, a company that owns 4 successful lifestyle channels and a company that owns 2. The combination of the 2 companies, is it more valuable than 2 separate companies? Or if I'm hearing you correctly, it's all about individual network's appeal to viewers.","Kenneth W. Lowe","It is about individual networks, no question. But remember, our philosophy, our strategy from day 1 has been to target upscale women. So our brands are cohesive and work well together because, and Burton talked about this very well, it makes it easier for ad sales, the team, to sell a targeted approach. If you had, for example, which we take, a nonfiction brand the targeted men highly successful, absolutely. But this, again, is just our blueprint. I'm not suggesting it's everyone's, but it's worked well for us, and I don't see that in any way lessening over the coming months and years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laura Martin from Needham.","Laura A. Martin - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So 3 things. One is, on international, you guys have gotten big enough international, do you have a sense of what peak margins for international assets [indiscernible] should be [indiscernible]?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, Joe, do you want to take that?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes, Lori [ph], you're breaking up at the end there, but I can -- we can barely hear you, but I can answer the peak margin question, or maybe update it a little bit. We're not exactly sure, but clearly, the peak margins in international will probably be lower than they are in the states. It's a very large lucrative ad market here. And internationally, you have some markets that have very robust ad markets and some that are more distribution-based. So we would sort of expect that on an O and O [ph] situation, you could get to the low to mid-30s, probably, as a peak in a lot of these markets.","Laura A. Martin - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, Lori, you said that programming cost, if I wrote this down, it will be up double digits in third quarter but up low single digits in fourth quarter. Is that also the cash, how the cash flows out, or why the big difference quarter-to-quarter?","Lori A. Hickok","Laura, that really has to do with how we're premiering programming, so that we're basically having a lot more premieres that are going to happen and that's a year-over-year, if you just look at shift to shift, the cash, pretty much, we're spending the cash ahead of that cycle. So you may see that we had a little bit more of bump in cash because -- that's why you're seeing [ph] the third quarter and [ph] year-over-year increasing. So it really is tied directly to our schedule -- scheduling.","Laura A. Martin - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, interesting. And then on a comment you just made on digital, I thought it was interesting you said you were successful kind of converging digital with linear. Did you guys -- can you size how much digital you think added to your upfront numbers this year, 10%, 20%, what do you think digital added in your upfront buys?","Burton F. Jablin","I really don't have that kind of data drilled down that much. But this year, I can say this. We purposely go out with specific shows that we have on both the television and the digital component for that we sell in the upfront, and we're very successful in creating some very nice packages [indiscernible] to sales.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Lori [ph], it's Ken, I think we've talked about this before. Because of the engagement of our audience, we think it bodes well on the digital platform, so to Michael's question earlier, this is just about us through partnerships, investments and our own creative shop creating businesses and content that will work across all platforms. So we're -- we had a very good reception in the new front, and we think this is just going to be another good revenue stream for us going forward. And by the way, good report on video.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Research","Just a few questions on the affiliate fee side. I know you're tracking for mid single-digit growth here, but any earlier thoughts -- early thoughts on '15 and '16? I think you have a few bigger, chunkier deals coming up. How are those negotiations coming along at this point, and how might consolidation on the distribution side impact your negotiations? And then before -- and then just one last part on the affiliate side. How important is it for you to push distribution in your flanker brands, like Cooking and DIY, and would that offset any kind of rate increases that you would see?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Well, thanks for the question, Amy. Without going into specifics about any negotiations or specific companies that we're dealing with right now, we are in the middle of some negotiations. I would say we're fairly pleased with how things are going and what our prospects are with most of them. These are always tough. I mean, there's just no question about it. But Henry Ahn and his team are doing a great job of establishing our value. And we think we're going to see what we deserve in terms of our rates. On the expansion of our less distributed networks, yes, we absolutely want to see those distributed more broadly, and that is part of our discussions. We think they add value to a distributor's line up. The -- certainly, DIY and Cooking Channel are enjoying some terrific numbers, whenever they are opened up in a preview, where more people can see them, their ratings soar, which indicates there's a demand for them. And we think that broader distribution will serve not only us well, but our distributors well. In Great American Country, as I've said, we are -- that is absolutely a work in progress. We're seeing some really nice gains there, and we'd love to see more distribution for it, too.","Unknown Executive","Amy, we'd be remiss if we didn't say that we think those smaller networks perform so well for distributors, that we wouldn't expect to have to take any kind of trade-off or make any kind of trade-off between rate and for the distribution of those networks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","I have a couple. You guys have always been very upfront -- no, that's a bad joke. You guys have always been very honest about how you've sold advertising and these kind of markets. I wonder, in this season, we've heard from other companies that they've held back inventory because they didn't like the deals they were getting this upfront. So how do you guys -- in terms of your volumes and your inventory this upfront versus previous upfronts, was there any change in your strategies? It sounds like price was pretty good, but what about the volume side?","Burton F. Jablin","Yes, this is Burton. Thanks for the question. We did hold back a little inventory because our sales team assessed the marketplace. And like some of our peers, saw what they saw. But we're always within a range, a fairly narrow range of what we open up in inventory. And the fact that we reached that $1 billion mark for the third year in a row shows that we still did pretty well in the marketplace. And of course, we did get those solid mid-single range increases in CPM. So all in all, we're feeling pretty good about how things went.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then I have 2 in international, and maybe this is to Joe and to Ken. I wonder what you guys think about the landscape for acquisitions internationally, and does the stepped up buyback that we're seeing now kind of say that the pipeline of things you think that are big enough is kind of drying up? So what's your view on what you guys can do on the M&A front abroad?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes. Thanks, Michael. This is Joe. I would say that we saw a number of sizable assets come to market over the last couple of years. We don't expect that there will be really large deals. If they do, we're, as you know, very disciplined, very careful about it. We're trying to stick to our knitting in the lifestyle and nonfiction space and maybe some adjacent categories. We would do things if we thought there was a real strategic reason to do them that are a little bit outside the space. But there's a lot of activity, it just tends to be smaller deals and the potential for JVs where somebody can bring distribution and we could bring programming. So we so we don't -- I guess to your point, we don't see huge uses of cash for international M&A. That doesn't mean we won't put the P&L to work or be very active. And we feel very comfortable that we can continue to buy back shares in an environment where we're not putting that kind of money into M&A.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And lastly, philosophically, on this one. You're seeing some of your peers start going free-to-air in some markets and skip, and maybe leap over the traditional pay-TV gatekeepers? So philosophically, given that you're a bit later in building out distributions than some of the other guys, how do you think about trading off distribution fees for gaining free-to-air penetration?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, we're very open to that. In fact our launch in Italy was essentially free-to-air, and in fact, we've had very, very good results there in terms of just getting the programming exposed to a much wider audience much faster. So there are trade-outs that you can make. And in our case, we would definitely look at those opportunities we have. And as I just mentioned, we did execute on one in Italy, and we're looking at other opportunities where they're available.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Looking at specific networks, Food Network, in terms of its year-over-year growth, had the strongest quarter since like the third quarter of 2012. Wondered if you could sort of drill down a little bit in terms of what's driving that growth now in terms of the advertising market versus affiliate fees? Because it seems like ratings have sort of just kind of been holding steady there. And then in contrast, when you look at Travel Channel, Travel Channel probably had its slowest growth quarter in a couple of years. And what's impacting that?","Burton F. Jablin","Well, this is Burton. On Food Network, I think what's going on there is just the solidity of that brand even with its ratings struggles. If you're an advertiser who wants the high-quality audience that they have, wants the environment that they've created, the kind of specific food programming that doesn't vary depending on the daypart, there really is still only one place to go. And the quality of that audience, quality of the brand and the fact that they have had some shows, as I mentioned earlier, Guy's Grocery Games, Cutthroat Kitchen, Food Network Star is doing very well, Worst Cooks within the second quarter, all of which are growing in ratings. And combine that with -- even beneath the relatively stable ratings that they've had over the last year, we're seeing some really healthy signs for the network. The median age has come down a couple of years, median income remains incredibly strong. Food Network, at the moment, continues. In July, Food Network was a top 10 network in adults 25 to 54, Top 5 network in women 25 to 54. So I think it really is just the strength of the brand and quality of the audience. Even if there's more competition, I don't mean to be bragging too much, but the highest quality will stand out. And on travel, as I said earlier, we're building that network. So we're going to see some fluctuation in what's going on there. We are happy with what happened in upfront. We showed advertisers what we're working on for the future. I'm pleased with the reaction to that. And most importantly, for this network, we are improving the quality of the audience. We're not where we want to be exactly yet with that quality, but we're moving forward. And the new shows that will come on will make that an even more apparent differentiation for the network that will attract more advertisers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Joyce with ISS Group (sic) [ISI Group].","David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","One kind of follow-up on prior question. With your programming investment on Travel Channel really being -- aiming at ramping that network up, do you expect that to be more of a seasonal channel? Like are we going to see some more ebbs and flows? I just wondered if you could provide some more color on how that has performed and where do you think it should go? And then secondly, on the international side, since you've got about 15% revenue exposure at this point, consolidated and unconsolidated, what portion of your programming investment is currently being allocated outside the U.S., and where do you see that going in time?","Burton F. Jablin","So this is Burton, I'll start on the Travel Channel question. We see some seasonality with some of our networks, DIY puts landscaping programming on in the summer -- spring and summer because that's when people are mostly interested in it, for example, and of course, we have tremendous tune in for our holiday programming and Internet content on Food Network. With Travel Channel, there's not as much seasonality there. There's a little bit during the summer. We have a great campaign that says we own summer. There's programming on along the lines of summer fun, extreme water parks, roller coasters, amusement parks, things like that, and those do very, very well in the summer. They tend not to do as well in the winter. So there is some seasonality. We believe, though, that we can sort of even some of that out with some of the new programming that's in the works. But there will always be some attempt to capitalize on people's interest in certain subjects, depending on the time of year.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes. And David, this is Joe. On the international programming question, I think the learning that we've had there, much to our delight, is that the library that we have here has performed much better than we thought it would on an international stage. We went into the business with the conviction that the concepts we had and the genre that we were distributing were going to be very attractive globally. And obviously, we wanted to put the library to the test. We knew that it was appealing to certain markets, because we've been in the licensing business for a long time. But now that we have an equity stake in many of these ventures, it's been more important to us to see how the library performs. And we've been very happy with it. We do a very modest amount of programming, original programming in some of these markets, and that may ramp up as we get bigger because the bigger you get, the more viewership you get and the more local network might need to be in certain markets. But for now, the library has performed extremely well for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Kind of follow-up on the commentary you made on the upfront volumes. You said you hit the $1 billion mark again, which is a pretty powerful number. But did you actually quantify what the delta in volumes were year-over-year? And then I guess as a follow-up, it sounds like you had probably a relatively stronger upfront than some of your peers. And I'm curious, what you think -- where do you think the volume is going? Is it going into scatter? What -- have discussions sort of convinced you of that -- is it going out of the market into other media? Is it slower ad spend for the advertisers? What's really happening in this process right now?","Burton F. Jablin","Okay. Well, this is Burton, David. On the first question, no, we're really not going any further than to say we held back a little inventory but still hit our $1 billion number. So we're very pleased with that. In talking to Steve Gigliotti and Jon Steinlauf about where the dollars have gone, a little bit maybe has gone to digital, but our sense is that advertisers are holding back for calendar upfront and scatter. And that makes us feel pretty good because our sales force is really geared toward scatter business. We have a long history of doing exceptionally well in scatter markets, both in terms of the deals we do and the CPM, the pricing. So we feel pretty good about where that's going. But other than that, there doesn't seem to be too much of a mystery, just some holding back because advertisers want to wait for scatter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask on the affiliate revenue side. The acceleration this quarter, which I think you credited to some additional distribution for your emerging networks, that sounds like that should continue in the back half? I just wanted to clarify that, that was the case.","Lori A. Hickok","Yes, Ben, that's actually incorporated into our guidance in our back half, yes.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And on the advertising side, Lori, is it sort of your expectation to see a little slower growth than the first half in the back half? It sounded like that was the guidance implication, I just wanted to clarify.","Lori A. Hickok","You are right on target. If you look because we're staying with our full year guidance, so based on the pricing information we provided, as well as looking at the first half, that's a very good deduction on your part.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Basic math for me. And I just want to ask on the subscriber front. There's been a couple of comments -- Disney made a comment on their call about a little bit of a headwind on pay-TV subs for the fully distributed networks. I didn't know if you were seeing any of that. I know it's probably tiny if it's there, but it is something that we've heard from a couple of other companies. If you're seeing any different tiering or packaging in the pay-TV business that might benefit Scripps as being sort of a core basic cable network, any comments there would be helpful.","Lori A. Hickok","Well, Ben, we are seeing those same headwinds that others have talked about, but probably not to the same extent because we're a must-have in a lot of the packages. So what we're seeing is the impact. As they lose subs, of course, that impacts all of their packages. But the good news is the telcos are gaining share, so that's helping to offset some of that, plus the fact that we're gaining distribution for our smaller networks. So all in all, I think we're boding better because again, to the things you've heard Ken and Burton talk about, about the quality of our networks, it holds true when you start looking at bundling and packaging. So I think that we continue to fight against all those headwinds that the industry is seeing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alan Gould with Evercore.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I've got 2 questions. First, on the advertising side. Industry-wide, if there's a higher supply of advertising in the scatter market, what makes you confident that there'll be a higher demand and that pricing will hold up beyond the third quarter? I mean, the third quarter, I'm sure you have a view on, and then I have a follow-up question.","Burton F. Jablin","Good question. This is Burton. My optimism is based on our track record, and the track record shows that year-after-year, we do well in our scatter pricing. And it goes back to how our networks work. We refer to this all the time. There's the quality audience, the high-quality environment. Endemics play a big role in this, for almost all of our networks. And for many of them, we're the only place to go. And so that let's [ph] us stand out even if the supply is greater in the scatter market.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you are differentiated. I recognize that. And Ken, this may go back a little bit to the scale comment, but you over-index in advertising, but it appears that you possibly under-index in affiliate fees relative to your ratings. Now that could be an opportunity for higher ratings growth, but do you think that's at all a function of scale?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Let me answer that. I think first and foremost, we made a decision, and you probably heard me say this in the past, we made a decision early on not to give away any equity for initial higher sub-fees, if you will. So if you go back to the early days of home and garden and food, which, as you know, was 10 years free, it took us a little while -- a little while longer to climb up the affiliate fee mountain, if you will. Having said that, I think, going forward, in this potentially consolidated world on the distribution side, it's going to come down to the quality of the brands, the must-have brands, and those are the ones that I think are going to bode better in affiliate fees. So the good news is, we actually have some room to grow. It's kind of putting the silver lining behind the cloud, or the fact that it's taken us longer to get to these affiliate fee levels. But I'm actually fairly optimistic of our ability to grow affiliate fees. Again, if you look at what we said earlier, outside of sports and news, we're the most \"live viewed networks\" among all cable. So we have a lot of things going for us when we walk in and sit down in these future negotiations. So yes, we've got some grow room there, but I actually think we can grow into higher affiliate fees.","Operator","And our final question will come from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right, wrapping up the final question. I'd love just to hit on international one more time, if you will excuse that. I know it's such an important priority for you guys, and I think there was a really interesting case study, I think, that maybe we can learn something from in Asia. So about a year ago, you guys acquired Asian Food TV, and it sounds like your feedback from being over there recently is very strong. But then, interestingly, a month or so ago, I think some networks traded in New Zealand, a food channel and a lifestyle channel, I think Discovery acquired them. I guess I was somewhat surprised, given you're already in Asia and you had made one acquisition there that we didn't see Scripps involved in that transaction. So anything you could share on the criteria you use on choosing where you would go forward with something like Asian Food TV, but then would not choose to go forward with something like the New Zealand networks, would be very helpful.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Sure, this is Joe. I think the short answer is, we were not aware that there was a process, and it was not an open process. We knew -- we're obviously aware of the channels. We hope that someday, they might change hands. We were as surprised as anyone that they traded. So we certainly would've been there, and those are exactly the kind of things we want to active in. And when we get a shot at them, I think we are the natural buyer. There's no other player out there that has access to lifestyle programming. Typically, when somebody runs a lifestyle program in another market, they come to us to try and buy programming. So -- but going forward, Australia is certainly a bigger market and very attractive to us, and we're working on some ideas to get -- to be in that region.","Mark W. Kroeger","All right.

Instructions will be given at that time.","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Dylan Jones, Chief Communications Officer.

On the call with us this morning is Ken Lowe, our Chairman, President and CEO; Burton Jablin, Chief Operating Officer; Lori Hickok, Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Samples, President of International.","We'll start the conference call with prepared remarks that should take about 20 minutes.

Actual results may differ from those predicted and some of these factors that may cause results to differ are set forth in our publicly filed documents, including our Form 10-K.","With that, I will turn it over to Ken.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Dylan. And good morning, everyone. Very happy that you are able to join us today, especially since this is a very busy couple of days for all of you I know. Put simply, this was one of the best quarters in the company's history. Scripps Networks Interactive has become synonymous with distinctive lifestyle programming and strong consistent financial performance. That's something that we're committed to every quarter and every year, and needless to say, we're off to another great start this year.","In the first quarter of 2016, total operating revenues grew 24%. Consolidated advertising revenues grew 31% thanks in part to the inclusion of TVN. Advertising revenues for the U.S. Networks increased 14%, making Q1 the best advertising revenue growth quarter for us in more than five years. Adjusted segment profit increased 27%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 34% to $1.37.","Now, Burton and Lori will go into the details on the quarter in a few minutes, but I want to highlight just some of the remarkable results delivered by our brands during the first quarter. Scripps Networks Interactive was the only network group to see all of its U.S. television networks ratings increase compared with the prior-year quarter. We are six for six in network growth, making this one of the best ratings quarters in the company's history.","HGTV continues its impressive string of records. The first quarter in 2016 marked the network's highest rated quarter ever with adult viewers 25 to 54 for sales prime, total day, and weekend. Food Network and Travel Channel both saw their second consecutive quarter of primetime ratings growth and TVN Group delivered an outstanding ratings quarter, up 4% over last year on the strength of the new TVN primetime lineup. We have strong brands, compelling content and programming the viewers love and trust, especially the upscale and highly engaged audiences that advertisers are looking to reach. Our audiences are savvy, they are well informed, and most importantly, they are ready to buy.","The research speaks for itself. In the March 2016 brand identity study published by Beta Research, HGTV tied for first as a favorite network among viewers over 18. Additionally, viewers designated five of our six U.S. Networks to be among the top 12 networks on which they are inclined to pay the most attention to commercials. Now this is exactly why our advertising partners trust us quarter-after-quarter, resulting in the remarkable advertising performance that we reported today.","These are all great brands with high quality content that consistently deliver and engaged audience better than anyone else in the industry and we do it night after night. For example, HGTV primetime viewership is within 15% of its weekly primetime average every night of the week. At Food Network, it's six of seven nights. Now this remarkable consistency really demonstrates the high degree of schedule and programming strength over a broad number of shows and nights. In the midst of ever changing and expanding viewer options, our family of networks remains essential to distributors. They are the must-have networks that consumers consistently seek out for lifestyle content.","We recently held our upfront presentation in seven United States markets. And I have to say we received an enthusiastic response to the new season of entertaining and family-friendly programming. We're confident this will be reflected in our upfront negotiations. We have the best advertising sales team in the business, and that continues to pay off.","We're also well positioned to take advantage of the wealth of opportunity of our lifestyle brands outside the United States. Since launching in 2009, our International Networks have expanded to more than 175 countries and territories, touching more than 272 million cumulative subscribers in 29 languages. We continue to launch our lifestyle brands in major international markets, recently with Food Network in Australia, and we'll soon benefit from additional distribution in seven Latin American countries. And there remains significant opportunity to grow the HGTV brand around the world.","Of course, our international growth was topped off last year by the transformative acquisition of TVN, which is the leading multi-platform media business in Poland. Now the team there is doing a great job working across all consumer touch points to deliver content that consumers crave, that audiences and advertisers demand. TVN is really the leading lifestyle media company in Poland, and we believe it has the opportunity to become even stronger. We've got a number of initiatives in the pipeline to make that a reality.","We've accomplished much in a short amount of time with our International Networks, and we are very excited to see what comes next as we continue to develop and grow our global footprint.","Now, I want to thank you again for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. And with that, let me turn it over to Burton, who has some details on our first quarter results. Burton?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","All right. Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Well, what a way to begin the year. With the investments we've made in programming and the international business, the company is performing at a high level.","As Ken mentioned, the first quarter in 2016 marked HGTV's highest-rated quarter ever with viewers 25 to 54 for sales primetime, total day and weekend and outpaced the next highest-rated quarter by an incredible 12%. In fact, HGTV was the only top five cable network to post a ratings gain in the first quarter versus last year for adults 25 to 54 in primetime. Driving this record growth were viewer favorites like Fixer Upper, which finished its record-breaking third season as one of the highest rated programs in the network's history, and Flip or Flop, with ratings soaring 26% for adults 25 to 54. HGTV also delivered its highest-rated quarter ever for Millennials 25 to 34, with ratings up 10%. And so far in the second quarter, these positive trends are continuing. HGTV just announced that April 2016 was its highest-rated and most-watched April ever for primetime adult 25 to 54 viewers, a 9% increase over April 2015.","Food Network continued to post solid ratings in the first quarter, too, especially among adults watching with their children. Kids Baking Championship, Cake Wars and Chopped Junior helped push up primetime co-viewing during the quarter. Food Network wins with Millennials as well, posting a 5% ratings improvement with that viewer group in the month of March.","Travel Channel continues to gain momentum, reporting its highest-rated quarter in two years. We're building our upscale female audience on the network, as well. In fact, on most nights the network now attracts more women than men. In April, Travel Channel grew 15% among adults 25 to 54 and 26% for women 25 to 54 compared with the prior year. This was the network's best performance since 2013, and we feel this is just the start. Travel Channel represents one of the most significant growth opportunities for the company, and its recent progress shows that we're well-positioned to deliver on that expectation.","DIY Network had a very strong showing, delivering its most-watched quarter ever among adults 18 and over driven by strong performing shows, including Texas Flip and Move and Tiny House, Big Living.","Cooking Channel had the highest-rated and most-watched first quarter in its history among both adults and women 25 to 54, maintaining its steady growth rate that it's had since 2010.","And rounding out the U.S. Networks, Great American Country, also experienced ratings gains, posting its highest-rated sales prime ratings in eight years.","Now linear TV isn't the only place we built success in the first quarter. We launched Scripps Lifestyle Studios in the fourth quarter of 2015, consisting of a dedicated editorial team to create digital and video content. Their online videos have received great response and increasing engagement from their targeted audiences during the first month of 2016. The Scripps Lifestyle Studios team produced over 1,000 videos for mobile and social platforms in the first quarter and that's quite an achievement for a group we formed just a few months ago. This output is helping us gain greater traction in the content marketing and social video marketplaces. Food was our entry point on to these new platforms, but we're aggressively targeting the home category as we move further into 2016.","And speaking of growth in digital, we recently renewed our agreement with Snapchat, which offers us another way to reach Millennials and provides a new path for our advertisers to reach consumers. It's still relatively early days for the platform, but we're looking forward to bringing more content to light through that application.","Scripps Networks Interactive proudly embraces innovation and pioneering new formats, and we'll continue to expand our content and functionality as we make our valued programming available on as many platforms as possible.","The last several quarters have been especially exciting for our International Networks as the company continues to grow outside the United States. To start, I want to highlight the promotion of Derek Chang, who will head up our International Lifestyle Channels, and the addition of Eduardo Hauser, who will direct SNI's businesses across Latin America. Derek and Eduardo's wealth of industry experience will enable us to tap into the numerous opportunities for our networks as we continue to build our global lifestyle brands.","In Poland, TVN's networks achieved 6% revenue growth in local currency compared with the prior year quarter. TVN, the broadcast channel, was number one in its commercial target group for viewers 16 to 49, attaining more than 13% market share in the first quarter. And over the same time period, the TVN Group increased their total market share by 4%.","We're incorporating original lifestyle content into TVN's lineup. One of the first efforts was a locally produced version of DIY Network's Kitchen Crashers, which premiered on TVN Style channel. Another SNI format, House Crashers that's locally produced will premiere later this summer. And TVN is also producing episodes of House Hunters International in Europe. And those episodes will premiere in the U.S. later this year.","As you can tell, the integration of TVN into our international portfolio is producing impressive results. For its just completed fiscal year, UKTV posted record revenues that increased 13% and record operating profits, which grew 10%, both in local currency. The multi-channel broadcaster also grew its share of viewing from the prior year. UKTV's phenomenal results were driven by strong advertising revenues, continued investment in original programming and strong financial discipline.","So 2016 is off to an extraordinary start. We remain committed to what we do best, bringing life to lifestyle as we develop an even deeper connection with our consumers across all of our brands.","Now I'll turn it over to Lori, who will review the company's financial performance for the first quarter of 2016.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. Since you've seen our strong results I'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, provide updated guidance and then open it up for Q&A.","And as Burton mentioned, what a terrific start to 2016 with revenues up an impressive 24%. This growth was primarily driven by a strong U.S. advertising market coupled with ratings improvement across all six U.S. Networks and a significant expansion of our international business through our acquisition of TVN last year. Adjusted segment profit increased 27% fueled by the strong revenue growth. This increase in adjusted segment profit translated into a robust 34% growth in adjusted earnings per share compared with the prior year.","We had a great quarter at our U.S. Networks segment. Revenues increased 10% driven by strong revenue demand for our lifestyle networks as well as continued distribution revenue growth. For advertising revenues, strong CPM pricing coupled with ratings growth at all six of our networks drove a 14% year-over-year increase in the first quarter. Scatter versus scatter CPM pricing was up in the low-double digits year-over-year and up low 20%s over the broadcast upfront.","Our top five advertising categories during the quarter were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, financial and automotive. These categories are fairly consistent with prior periods. The strong advertising market has continued into the second quarter with scatter versus scatter CPM pricing up mid to high teens year-over-year and up low to mid-20%s over the broadcast upfront.","Contributing to the 2% growth in U.S. Networks distribution revenue were negotiated rate escalators with our traditional distribution partners as well as new distribution related to over-the-top broadband providers. These were partially offset by the previously disclosed one-time rate equalization of certain distributor agreements related to consolidation and low-single digit subscriber declines also in line with expectations. The healthy 20% growth in adjusted segment profit for the U.S. Networks reflects the increase in revenues partially offset by a slight increase in expenses. The increase in cost of services was largely offset by decreases in SG&A expenses. This reflects a shift of marketing costs to later in the year along with the ongoing operating efficiencies achieved from the restructuring, including the recent Travel Channel reorganization.","International Networks revenues increased significantly to $121 million from $24 million due to the inclusion of TVN in the first quarter of 2016. And as Burton mentioned, for the quarter, TVN's revenues grew 6% in local currency compared with the same time a year ago. International segment profit was $10 million, compared with a loss of $6 million a year ago. This $16 million improvement is primarily related to the inclusion of TVN as we continue to invest in our international lifestyle networks. Historically for TVN, the first and third quarters have lower margins while the second and fourth quarters have higher margins.","In addition to our consolidated results, we have significant international operations reported in our equity earnings. In total, equity in earnings of affiliates was $26 million, up 36% compared with the prior year. This growth is primarily related to the addition of NC+, an investment held by TVN, and UKTV's improved performance. Partially impacting the growth was the sale of our minority interest in Fox Sports South. We recorded a $208 million pre-tax gain during the quarter related to the sale of this minority holding. Going forward, we expect that the majority of equity and earnings of affiliates will come from our international investments.","On the balance sheet, I want to touch on a couple of items. Our capital allocation priorities are to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our overall leverage and invest in M&A, both in the U.S. and internationally.","On the M&A front, in addition to selling our Fox Sports South minority stake, we also acquired the remaining 35% interest in Travel Channel from Cox Communications for $99 million in cash and certain tax benefits. Travel Channel is a key asset for the company and one, which we believe, holds great upside potential.","We finished the first quarter at approximately 3 times gross leverage down from 3.2 times at the end of 2015. The first quarter leverage reflects both the Fox Sports South minority sale and the Travel Channel buy-in. It also reflects a reduction on the amended revolving credit facility of approximately $325 million. And we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter as we focused on de-levering and the M&A activities previously mentioned.","Finally, as a result of the stronger-than-expected advertising market combined with the strong ratings performance, we are updating our full year 2016 guidance. All guidance is based on adjusted consolidated company results. Due to the increase in revenue, we now expect adjusted segment profit to increase approximately 8% year-over-year, up from the previously issued 7%. All other 2016 guidance remains unchanged.","As a reminder, for the first half of 2016, we expect to realize a higher growth rate due in part to easier advertising comps for the U.S. Networks segment and because TVN results were not included in the first half of 2015. We continue to expect that the third quarter will be impacted by the Summer Olympics and to a lesser extent the Presidential election. So it should be the slowest revenue growth quarter of the year. Then revenue growth should accelerate somewhat for the fourth quarter of 2016.","Additionally, for the third quarter, due to the timing of certain expenses, it should be the lowest adjusted segment profit margin quarter of the year.","And with that, we're ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions, I have two. I think in the prepared remarks you talked about embracing innovation in terms of over-the-top platforms. And just to continue the theme on the (20:34) subject of Hulu Live, I would think that for your content, it would actually lend itself better to live programming. So I guess to the extent that Internet delivered viewership of cable TV content shifts to live and away from SVOD and on-demand viewership, I think that's a benefit to your company. Ken, is that consistent with your view of what's going on in terms of the introduction of these newer platforms?","And then, second question, and maybe this is for Burton or Lori, in terms of conversations you're having with your marketers, they're obviously allocating a lot greater spend to your networks, and clearly ratings is a big part of the reason why. I just wonder what are you hearing from big advertisers about their view on the ROI or effectiveness of your ads in terms of driving conversion to sales? And obviously that conversation dovetails with what's the relative ROI of social media ad spending given the growth in spend on social media platforms. I'd love to hear about that. Thanks.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Anthony. Good morning, and thanks for your questions. Yeah, let me take the first one, which you partially answered. And as you know, we have consistently always delivered the better live performances. As you've heard us say many times, 94% of our viewing on average varies somewhere in the low 90s, is done in a C3 window. And by the way, to that point, you probably saw the information that Nielsen released yesterday which very much reflects that live viewing with reality-based non-fiction programming is more in the first three days than over the seven days.","And look, it's the way we've been built. Part of that is the advertising environment so that the commercial is not only are viewed but are viewed in that live window, which is very important in advertising, especially when it's timely. And it also plays well, I think, to our content and that's why we have longer viewing periods where people tune into our networks and they tend not to tune away because there's very few objectionable periods or speed bumps, if you will, or just blockbuster type shows. And that's why you heard in my comments we do so well consistently over a seven-night period. Our content is not from a ratings success standpoint just road blocked over a night or two, it's consistently six or seven nights a week.","So all of this plays very well into, I think, some of the trends you mentioned that we are starting see more important space on live, live streaming and even with the announcement of Hulu is up and coming venture in 2017. So I hope that answers your question.","But, yes, it's the way we've been built. It's the expectations that our viewership has now of the networks and also the way we stack programming and promote. So I will let, Burton, do you want to take the second part of...?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. Hi, Anthony. So thanks for asking that question. I was with our ad sales team last week. So I got a very current point of view on how advertisers are seeing that. This really ties into the long history of value that we provide to advertisers. And I think in the current environment, where social media and digital certainly bring a lot of data to an advertiser that they can use, there are also questions about the ability, all the things that you read. But we bring a lot of great data to advertisers as well. And there are factors like the environment that we create on our networks. Demonstrably, third-party research shows that viewers are more receptive to the advertising on our networks. That's been true over a long period of time and remains true. Simply, the subject matter that we're in provides an opportunity for advertisers to reach upscale viewers.","Again, the independent data shows that we have, as a group, the most upscale collection of viewers on television. And then you combine that with just the consistency that we talked about in our opening remarks, night after night, advertisers, marketers know what they're going to get when they advertise on our networks. There are no clunkers that they will find their ads in. There is consistency of viewing, and it ties into part of Ken's answer, which is the live viewing, the high rate of live viewing, that those ads are going to be seen when the advertisers intend them to be seen.","So we're hearing very positive point of view about what we offer marketers as compared to other television networks and even some other opportunities for them. Now that said, we have digital assets, too. We package those up with our television offerings, and we are doing all we can to minimize some of the objections to digital in terms of viewability and measurement and I think doing a good job there, too, as well.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to the line of Vasily Karasyov with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you very much. My question is about advertising. Some of your peers are talking about reducing advertising loads this year. Can you please talk about what your ad loads look like this year compared to last year or the historical average and are you planning on changing that in 2016 or 2017?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Hi, Vasily. This is Burton. Yes, I can answer that. Our ad loaded has been really consistent for long periods of time. We have no intention of changing that, adjusting up or down. We think we have the right ad load, have had it for years, and we'll stay that way.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of John Janedis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks. You talked about your ratings success, which as you know is stark contrast to the industry. And, I guess, you're able to take advantage of that on the ad front. So I realize you get more live viewing, but to what extent are you seeing advertiser demand for VOD or maybe what opportunity that might present for you going forward assuming industry ratings keep declining and the networks take ad supply?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Well, hi, John. This is Burton, again. Sorry to monopolize a little bit here, but again, I was with our ad sales team last week. So I've got current information.","We've seen growth in VOD and the advertising demand for it but it still remains small, and that's because the greater interest in our networks is the preponderance of live viewing and the benefit that that offers any marketer. We do believe, as we've said many times in TV Everywhere, which is essentially a version of VOD, at least in part, and over time, as that becomes a more meaningful number in terms of the number of people using it, watching it, then we'll expect to see some ad revenue there, too. But the nature of our networks, the live viewing means that that's really where advertisers see the value overtime.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","John, I would also add I do think the opportunity for us for digital ad insertion going forward is going to be very, very strong. But, as Burton said, I think we need more of a sample size going forward in how that's going to work and a little more time on the technical side to make sure the efficiency and the results are there. But if you look at how viewers and consumers consume our content, use our content, and as you can imagine because Burton came up with this a sort of years ago, it's the three I's: ideas, information, inspiration, when they are using it, maybe in a remodeling project or in a recipe or whatever, in a delayed basis or on a mobile device or wherever, being able to digitally insert ads, I think, is going to become an enormous opportunity for us over the long term.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffetNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. I have two for Burton. Let me do one at a time. First, on Travel, Burton. Given the improvement in ratings, is there anything changing on your promotion of the networks? Have you changed maybe the cross promotion of HGTV and Food for Travel? And then attracting the female demo, what has changed in terms of the skew of the programming to become perhaps more female?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Well, on the last part, we do so well in our other networks with the upscale women audience that it is intentional that we're trying to move Travel Channel programming in that direction, and we are having some success at that. It ties into the cross-promotion capability, the more we are able to make that audience on Travel Channel reflect the audiences that we have on HGTV and Food Network, the more we are able to use cross promotion to do that.","The benefits that we've seen in terms of improvement in ratings at Travel are really coming from what we said all last year, that we put on a group of shows in the fourth quarter, some of which didn't work we took some write-offs, about some of which did work, and we're reaping the benefits of that now into 2016.","But we also have stabilized the schedule. It's something we talked about for a couple of years there, too. Our scheduling team has worked really hard to create that greater consistency night after night. We're beginning to see that. We still have the ways to go with Travel Channel, but that's why we think there's more of side. So consistency in viewing patterns is something we've seen on the rise.","And then, we consolidated all of our networks under the same leadership of Kathleen Finch, and she put all of our marketing teams under the leadership of Shannon Driver. And as a result of that, we're looking at bringing the successful marketing strategies that we had at HGTV to Travel Channel, and you'll see those unfold over time, too, which again makes us confident that we have more upside there.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then, let me ask one of you based on what Lori said last quarter. I think when the year started we all assumed that first quarter will be strong and then it will decelerate and Q3 would be low because of the Olympics but given the ratings trends and given your scatter commentary, which is actually better in the first quarter, is there much of a slowdown in 2Q advertising versus first quarter or can you keep running at this nice rate that you just put up this quarter?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","I'll take that, but Lori can chime in as well.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Lori can chime in as well.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Again, our ad sales team is very positive about second quarter. As Lori also said, though, that our comps year-to-year on a quarterly basis gets harder as the year goes on. So we still see a robust marketplace. Our ratings, as we said, into April are still doing well. All of the factors are still in place. So we feel good about second quarter but those comps are going to get a little harder as we go through the year.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And I would just \u2013 that's really what we have to remember is that the comps get harder and they get harder as we move the year. But the market is very strong and the other factor there is just the mix of what we're selling. You have got to keep in mind too that it is multiple marketplaces that we're selling into too. But healthy demand and it helps when you're producing the kind impressions and growth that we are, as we got those audiences and we're a safe haven for advertisers' because they know we're going to deliver those impressions, which really, really helps us and helps our sales team.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. It's actually Ryan Fiftal on. Just a follow-up on the previous question. I think given the strength in the quarter and the strength in the ad market, we're kind of scratching our heads on why you didn't feel comfortable raising the top line guide. So I get on the ad side, the comps get tougher. Is there anything on affiliate rev side we should be thinking about, potentially timing through the year, deceleration through the year, as the pending deals out there close? Thank you.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","So, Ryan. I think what you saw was the confidence that we are seeing, it was much easier to exhibit that through expanding our guidance on the adjusted segment profit. Revenue is a much bigger number. We feel very confident that we are there and I would say just stay tuned. We're not comfortable raising revenue at this point but all the signs are very positive and the 12% that we got for the full year is very, very solid.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Oh, hi, good morning. I feel like I do this every quarter. So I apologize if that \u2013 but want to just talk a little bit on the cost side, especially given the nice success at Travel, which I think has been a big recipient of a lot of investment over time, trying to get that formula right. And it seems like you've latched on to something here. So as we think about what that means going forward in terms of having to try and find new shows and add new hours, are we approaching more of a steady-state sort of situation at least for a while, and would that mean that maybe sort of a year-over-year cost investment as we look forward to the next couple of years you might be expected to continue to taper down a little bit?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Well, Todd, much like you feel like you keep repeating that I will keep answering is that we really feel comfortable with where we are as far as our investment in hours and if those hours go up at Travel or any of our networks, it's really commensurate with the revenue growth at this point. So, you really wouldn't see one going up without seeing some sort of boost on the top line. But we really, as we said, we see the investment on our U.S. Networks really moderating. When we brought on Travel, and we were trying new shows, we knew some would fail, some would work that there was an outsized investment there. What we will have is more stability in those hours, especially with Travel as you start having more and more returning series, your predictability and your ability to control your investment growth becomes more certain. But, again, it's a little art and science then we'll continue to do the right thing for the screen.","But, again, we have a fairly good focus on the investments. We feel like number of hours that we are producing are the right hours. We will mix and mix and change those things. And again, the success you are seeing like at HGTV give us the ability to experiment and find the new \u2013 the hits of the future while still having the strength of the current schedule.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much. A few questions. I think, Ken, I'm just curious your thoughts of the new virtual MVPDs, partly because you're already in Sling. I mean, just, do you think overall these are going to be successful or highly successful sort of taking share from traditional operators, do you think this is really sort of yet to be proven?","And for Burton, I'm just wondering how you have the calendar upfront and obviously we're going into this upfront with your scatter pricing continuing to ramp. Is that your expectation that the mid-year upfront here you should have better prices than you just saw in the calendar upfront and would you care to share what kind of price increases you did see in the calendar upfront? Thank you.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Doug. In answer to your first question, I think I heard it. It was a little hard to hear on this end of the line. But on the virtual \u2013 yes. I think, in general, they'll do okay. It's pure speculation at this point but I do think you might see some shifting from one distributor to another and it's going to be on an incremental basis.","What's going to be more important I think is the technology that goes along with it. And by that, I mean, let's just take the new Xfinity box that Comcast has rolled out and Cox is using the same technology. These new generations of boxes and what you're going to be able to do as a consumer is going to have, I think, a great impact on the competition between distribution models, going forward. You marry that with smart TV, you put an enormous amount of power in the consumers' hands as to what they can watch, when they can watch, how they can watch, and I think those are going to be the game changers.","So it's not just about packaging and coming up with another service, be it traditional models that we've all grown up with over the past X number of years or some of the newer models that are rolling out, it's going to be all the bells and whistles that come along with it because I do think not only the Millennial generation but everybody now is just becoming accustomed to in a world of iPhones more technology and more options.","And one comment I would just make before I turn it over to Burton, a lot around the advertising market, if you look at the first quarter, it was a really unique quarter in the sense that the amount of sports programming and compelling sports programming, everything from the NFL Playoffs to the Super Bowl and NBA season which we saw a team surpass the Chicago Bulls of 73 wins, if you look at the NCAA Playoffs, which has never been more competitive and never more watched and for us to be able to deliver a 14% year-over-year advertising growth rate, I think it really underscores the value of our content, the environment that we are giving the advertisers.","So it's hard not to feel confident about advertising, going forward, but we still have to factor in seasonalities. We have dream home giveaways; we have different things throughout the year. So consistency to me is more important that quarter after quarter, if we're delivering the best of the peer group in advertising growth, we're pretty happy.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. And along those lines, we are feeling confident about the upfront but, of course, our big presentation is just ended. We're still all over the country doing dozens and dozens of presentations at individual agencies. And so it's a little early for us to give an indication of any kind of a number. But our sales team feels very confident about the upfront.","Calendar, as you noted, is traditionally a very strong market for us. There are a lot of endemics on the home side in particular that are in the calendar market. We enjoy the benefit of that. But as far as specifics on those CPM increases, it's just a little early for us right now. But we feel good.","Operator","Next, we will go to the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Just following up on the comments about the upfront, you guys have been doing this for many years. I would love to hear on sort of how you think \u2013 how much leverage you think you have or how much better you are positioned going into these upfront negotiations when you have such incredible ratings momentum like you have now versus maybe of an ordinary year. And then just sort of speaking generally on upfront pricing, I know it's early days but do you think you still will be able to maintain or you can grow that premium pricing versus your peers, given your positive live audience skew that you have enjoyed?","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Alexia. As you know, as usual great questions from you. It does give me a chance to say \u2013 you heard in my comments, we actually were in seven cities across the country with our upfront presentations. There are a few of us out there anymore doing upfront presentations. So, the obvious question is why do you guys do it? One reason we do it is because we like the ability for our advertisers to come commingle with our talent and truly understand why we are asking for these increases on something that is already premium priced.","So I think just to sit back and think that we will just push out data, we have to get out with the advertisers, we have to also hear them when we come up with advertising solutions because this is now becoming a game not just about 30s and 60s (40:18) as we all have seen evolve over the last several years. This is about advertising solutions. It is very much why we started the Scripps Digital Lifestyle Studio, because a lot of what we're doing now is in conjunction with these packages that we're selling. So you're not just buying advertising across this network, you're buying solutions, you're buying maybe placement in dream home giveaways, smart home giveaways, Food Network Kitchen and what we're doing there and on and on and on. So it's a longwinded way of saying, yes, we think not only are we priced at the top of the market, but can continue to push that. Because, let's face it, at the end of the day, quality and exclusivity are always going to be at a minimum and, therefore, are going to be priced at the high end of the market.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","And I'll just add, and we come through. We're completely reliable. We haven't suffered the kinds of viewership declines that others have, which means make goods and not delivering on a buy. And our current results show that that consistency just continues to support higher prices.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Laura Martin with Needham. Please go ahead.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Congratulations on the quarter.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Laura.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Ken, a couple things for you. So the chatter in this kind of earnings period has all been about sort of skinny bundles or digital bundles. And, I guess, I'm interested from you \u2013 Fox said yesterday they are not giving anybody in the digital world a break compared to the old world MVPD. Is everybody approaching you guys for all of your channels? Are they trying to cherry-pick your channels as these new digital alternatives come to you? And how are you thinking about price in the new world? Especially if they're threatening \u2013 if you are going to give them only one or two of your channels.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, actually we were talking about this before the call. I'm going to let Burton give you his opinion on this because I think collectively we've had recent meetings about this in distribution models. So, Burton, why don't you weigh in here?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. The way we would look at it is we have our main networks on every existing smaller bundle that's been out there. And, as you know, our less distributed networks are premium tier networks, DIY, Cooking and GAC have always been on tiers. And so we would expect a similar kind of relationship between a core bundle, if you want to call it that, and the premium tier bundles to continue. And that's not unusual for us and that's how we'll approach this particular aspect of distribution landscape. But for HGTV, Food and Travel, we want to make those part of any kind of core bundle that's out there, no matter how skinny or fat, and the others will talk to distributors about various tiers.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. And CBS is saying they are getting a pricing premium in these digital stripped-down bundles. Is that true of your channels as well in these skinnier bundles \u2013 those three big channels you mentioned?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","We've really not discussed that and disclosed that publicly. So I really don't have anything to say on that one. Ken, you want to...?","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, look, Les is the master of all of this, but I think, well, once you get into retransmission consent and those type of dollars and it's hard to classify premium if you're bringing retransmission consent into it, I think. So, in general, I think the best thing to say is we're not getting any \u2013 or offering any type of decreases in any of the packaging that are out there. And we think we continue to have upside, Laura, on the subscription side just because, in my opinion, we're still undervalued, but that's something for us and our distributors continue to talk about, which we will.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Couple of questions on HGTV, which is particularly strong. Is it fair to assume that the affiliate growth for that network is generally similar to what you see for the U.S. Networks overall, and therefore the top line growth is primarily advertising-driven? And also when you look at the ratings strength, I'm thinking HGTV but maybe more broadly, are you seeing new viewers coming in to watch the channels? Or is it a case where you see yourselves keeping your core viewers on longer? Thanks.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Hi, Michael, this is Burton. Thanks for those questions. So on affiliate growth, yeah, we're pretty consistent with what the universe overall is doing, but I would add this that because of the upscale nature of our viewers, any declines in the overall universe don't really affect us as they might other networks who have a less affluent viewership. In other words, our viewers are the ones who are least likely to drop or shave their pay television subscriptions. So in terms of just overall viewership, HGTV and the rest of our networks aren't immune, but have a pretty good protection against those kinds of declines that are affecting the overall universe.","In terms of ratings, yes, HGTV is absolutely drawing new viewers. The millennial growth that I reported on, 10% in ratings shows that we are bringing in viewers who are new to the network. And as we have seen over two decades now, once they become viewers, they stay with us. And so HGTV's trick, if you will, has been both maximizing the viewing of the viewers that we already have, and we do that probably better than any network programming, mainly half-hours, but also drawing in new viewers who we then keep in the family for a long, long time.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. One thing I'd just like to add to that is we view first-time homeowners, condominium owners, tiny homeowners as potential new viewers because in some cases they need to age into the network a little bit, if I may use that phrase. Because until you own your first home or you're getting serious about home renovation, fix-up or whatever, HGTV may or may not be as relevant in your viewing. But once that happens, and you can immediately see it in viewing numbers and in numbers that we associate with advertising with our home improvement partners and various other advertisers on the networks.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of David Joyce with Evercore. Please go ahead.","David Joyce - Evercore ISI","Given the increase in pay TV penetration around the globe, I was wondering if you could discuss sort of a heat map of where there is increasing demand for you to produce more locally-based originated programming. And then if you could also tie that in with how much of your programming is going to transportable around the globe. Thank you.","Jim Samples - President, International","Hi. This is Jim Samples. I will start by talking about Poland and TVN, where we have already been able to bring over both some of our formats to TVN. And they have produced local Polish versions of shows like Kitchen Crashers. Now they are doing House Crashers, and they are performing very well. So that's probably the best and most immediate example of how we are bringing our lifestyle know-how to networks around the world.","Similarly, in the UK, we are producing content for Food Network UK and Latin America. As we are expanding there, we have a number of shows that are in production, both in Brazil and throughout Latin America. We find these teams that work all around the world. And so it's not just the programming that we are able to voice-over or to localize, but actually we can bring both the formats and the production know-how and interpret that in each of the markets where we are operating.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, thank you very much. Just a couple of questions, maybe first on your affiliate fee growth, I think you talked about last quarter that's starting to reaccelerate as we get to the beginning of 2017. So I was just wondering if that is still the case and if there was an additional MVPD consolidation that's yet to occur that would have any impact on that. And then also the TVN organic growth was very helpful. I was wondering if you might be able to share some of the organic trends in the entire international business just to give us some idea of what it was doing year-on-year. Thanks very much.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Steven, on the affiliates, yes, it still remains true that we will see acceleration. Again, as we hit 2017, we're expecting mid to high single-digit pricing increases as we get through really the impact of consolidation, which is factored in pretty much this year for us.","Jim Samples - President, International","And this is Jim Samples. On international growth, you saw the TVN growth, so we have seen both good underlying fundamentals in the Polish economy, which is translating into strong demand for our programming and the advertising on that programming. So very, very positive trends there. Similarly, in the UK, if you took a look at the UK TV performance, very strong ratings performance as well as strong demand for advertising. As you look around the world, one of the nice things about getting to develop a diversified portfolio to the extent you've got some of these markets that are really popping if others are softer, it sort of brings in a nice balance growth from year-to-year.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","All right. Thank you. My question is also about the traditional bundle and the affiliate fees. One would've thought maybe one or two quarters ago, I think that consensus (50:12) was much more negative than it appears to be on this set of results. And you've also had obviously very, very strong advertising growth. So I just wonder if going into affiliate fee negotiations \u2013 whatever negotiations you may have upcoming, do you feel like you got a better hand right now? Just the mood in the markets is better and the ad growth is so strong. And then also could you please comment on TV Everywhere streaming rights that you may be offering and how the pricing might go on those? Thanks.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. This is Burton, Tim. On negotiations, yeah, I mean, we've always felt we were in a strong position given the nature of our networks, the value of the audience that we bring to a distributor. It's evidenced not only in our national advertising sales but based on what we know is going on in terms of local advertising that our distribution partners insert onto all of our networks. They had very strong sales there too. So we bring a benefit that's a little under the radar to our distribution partners, but that certainly factors in. We also believe that when you have an HGTV, that's pretty much the number one network for women viewing right now, particularly upscale women. It's been that way for nine years and Food Network, which is a top 10 to top 12 network, those are two very powerful brands that bring great value to a distributor. And over the years, Ken has said this, we believe we've been a bit undervalued in terms of distribution payments, but that can also work to our benefit. We are very good value, as a result, for distributors. But we'll continue to push the great benefits that our networks bring to any distributor.","On TV Everywhere, basically because we have rights for all of our programming, we own 100%, pretty close to 100% of all of our shows and the agreements that we've reached with our distributors, what you see of our top rated, top-performing shows in our networks, you will see streamed on TV Everywhere on-demand, but of course our networks are available for live streaming on TV Everywhere right now, and we're beginning to see more and more uptake of our TV Everywhere apps and as a result, more and more viewing, both live and on-demand. We're very pleased with that.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I just had one more follow-up question on these virtual pay TV firms. Historically, I guess there's been maybe two minutes allocated of local ad time to the distributor on the traditional model. As you move to these OVD models, is that holding true? Are they still getting a percentage of the local inventory, or is something changing?","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jason, excellent question because I think, historically, it's just always been assumed that this is the way deals are structured. And going forward in a world of virtual distributors and more consolidation on the linear side, it's easy to assume that these will become more into play in negotiations. In our case, for example, those two minutes an hour, you can imagine, are extremely valuable. And I think going forward they become even more valuable with digital ad insertion and the localization of our content. So, everything is on the table going forward in these distributions, especially with new and upcoming platforms and partnerships. So, just because it's historically been that way, the two minutes is going to be put into these negotiations on the distributor side, does not necessarily hold true going forward in the newer deals.","But, having said that, we'll see, because in some cases it's a great partnership, it's worked very well depending on how local ad sales teams are structured, et cetera. So, I won't get into the details of our negotiations, but let's just say that's at the forefront of our thinking because the value we think we bring to those two minutes each hour.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Mogil with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So, very shifting gears here. A couple articles in the UK newspapers about the BBC possibly looking to sell its half stake in UKTV. Maybe you can talk to us about if there is something ongoing there and whether or not you've got a first right of refusal and whether or not you've got appetite for the other half of it?","Jim Samples - President, International","Hi, Ben. This is Jim Samples. Clearly, we can't comment on any speculation or the market rumors that you are seeing. But what I can tell you is that UKTV is a fantastic asset. And it just continues to perform very, very strongly, both financially and the ratings as we've seen. And the management there, Darren Childs and his team, they've just done a phenomenal job. So we are continuing to work with both UKTV and the BBC to deliver even greater value for the shareholders as we move forward.","Operator","And we have time for one more question, and that's from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Please go ahead.","Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Thank you. You give a presentation at CES every year that really goes into some granularity on the inefficiencies and the opportunities in the advertising market. And, clearly, you get a lot of rigidity; people have always done business a certain way. But when you get better measurement from comScore and Nielsen and all that, how much of a mispricing phenomena by demographic do you think there is relating to efficacy of advertising and buying power? Do you feel like you could be 20%, 25% underpriced by virtue of the demographics that you bring? Is it just impossible to say? I'm sure something like this takes a long time to correct itself, but it feels like a lot of things are moving in your direction, even beyond what you've talked about?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Well, Matthew, this is Burton. Yeah, you've seen these presentations. Steve Gigliotti, Jon Steinlauf are both big believers in exactly what you're saying, that we can unlock greater value for our audiences, particularly audiences that traditionally are not the ones sought after on broad demographic buys, like adults 25 to 54. People over 54 do buy a lot of stuff. And to the extent that data like you're talking about can help us connect advertisers to those consumers who are specifically interested in buying the products that a marketer wants to promote, there is value to unlock there. And we believe we are uniquely situated, as your question suggests, to take advantage of that because of the nature of our content, the high quality of our audience, the money they have to spend and the nature of our subject matter. People buy stuff in the home, food and travel categories. So, I'm not going to put a number on it, because it would be pure speculation right now on what kind of percentage value we can unlock. But we certainly see value there going forward. As you said, this will play itself out over a period of time, but we are absolutely interested in pursuing this and we think we'll see the benefit of it.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Matthew, this is Ken, if I may just add on. It ties into a lot of questions asked on the call today, whether it's the upfront presentations, whether it's our thinking about advertising solutions. But I couldn't agree more with what Burton said. And the mere fact that you've actually seen our presentations at CES tells you this is the internal thinking that we have and this is where we are prepared to go because once we unlock more opportunities for our content, for example, on mobile devices, we see a very big upside there and being able to create advertiser solutions across multiple platforms that tie back to our content, long form, short form, micro-form, you name it. So to be continued. We can't put a number on it, but let's just say we are very confident there's upside there.","Dylan Jones - Chief Communications Officer & Executive VP","Well, thanks, everyone, for listening in today. As a reminder, Mike Gallentine and Sarah Burnett, and our Investor Relations team will be available for follow-up calls the rest of the day.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Chief Communications Officer, Mark Kroeger. Please go ahead.","Mark W. Kroeger","Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everyone. On the call with us this morning is Ken Lowe, our Chairman, President and CEO; Joe NeCastro, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer; Burton Jablin, President, Scripps Networks; and Lori Hickok, Executive Vice President of Finance. We'll start the conference call with prepared remarks that should take about 20 minutes, then we'll open it up for questions.","Let me remind you, if you prefer to listen in via the Internet, go to our website, click on the Investor button and find the microphone icon on the landing page.

[Operator Instructions] Let me remind you that our discussion this morning will contain certain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from those predicted, and some of the factors that may cause results to differ are set forth in our publicly filed documents, including our Form 10-K.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Ken.","Kenneth W. Lowe","All right. Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. You've all, hopefully, had a chance to review our third quarter results by now, and I'm sure you'll agree that this is a company that is performing very well. The underlying fundamentals are sound, and our third quarter results demonstrate continued and consistent strength. Scripps Networks Interactive is a global leader for quality lifestyle video, and we're delivering on our strategy to provide compelling content across the full range of video platforms.","Our firmly differentiated networks provide advertisers access to affluent audiences, untapped by our competitors, by the way. Coupled with our unparalleled level of live viewing, this gives us a tangible edge in the advertising marketplace.","Now looking at the third quarter. HGTV just literally knocked it out of the park, and for the 9th year in a row, I'm very proud to say, this was the #1 television destination for upscale women. Food Network, an unmistakably powerful brand, stayed right at the top of the pack and finished the quarter as a top 5 cable network for women again. Now Travel Channel. We're pressing forward with our long-term plan to define both the genre and the network. We recently announced some very exciting new programming that will give the channel the consistency it needs to become a reliable destination for the upscale audience that we want to reach.","Our other networks are top performers as well. DIY Network, Cooking Channel and Great American Country, generate committed, engaged audiences and deliver real value to our distribution partners. As you'll hear, we've renewed carriage agreements and added significant distribution, and that comes on the top of growing viewership and engagement that we're seeing across the board. We're expanding deals with existing partners and creating relationships with important technology and content players. And in doing so, we significantly improve our reach to ensure we deliver lifestyle video to our key audiences in whatever way they choose to consume it.","As we optimize our domestic business, we're also delivering on our international strategy and expanding our global footprint. We strengthened our competitive position in Europe. We've built momentum in Asia, and we've entered the key Latin American market. We've made progress in a very short time to raise our profile and export our popular brands and lifestyle programming expertise across the globe.","And our guiding principle has long been to organize this company around our core competency, creating high-quality lifestyle video content that engages our audience and advertisers who yearn to reach them. It's pretty straightforward as principles go, but it's one that we're convinced will guide us successfully into the future.","Now delivering on that vision requires great people, a nimble and agile structure and the kind of entrepreneurial zeal that has led to the creation of HGTV itself from 20 years ago, hard to believe. It means directing resources and capital to those projects and growth initiatives that hold the most promise for an outsized return on our investment. And it means making certain that we design and structure the company to take advantage of new opportunities as they emerge.","Now to that end, as we plan for 2015 and beyond, we're moving decisively with a program to focus our investment in quality lifestyle video content, while reducing costs within our support structure. We're organizing the company to ensure both its current success and its long-term future.","We've carved out a unique competitive advantage for ourselves at SNI. By staying true to our brands and true to our programming genres, we stand apart from the crowd. We stand apart with our distributors, our advertisers, but most importantly, with consumers. We're the first port of call for millions of viewers regardless of what device they're using or when they're using it, and that reach and importance is growing by the day. So I'm pleased to say the future for Scripps Networks Interactive is bright and full of opportunity. Our solid third quarter results underscore our strong economics and the sound business model that provide the foundation for our future.","So with that, let me turn it over to Burton, who will share highlights from the third quarter. Burton?","Burton F. Jablin","Thanks, Ken, and you are absolutely right, we are in an excellent competitive position. Perhaps nothing demonstrated that more than the distribution successes we achieved during the third quarter. In September, we announced a new multiyear omnibus agreement with DISH for all of our networks. Importantly, the deal secured long-term distribution of Travel Channel at improved rates and included expanded distribution for DIY Network and Cooking Channel. As part of the agreement, our networks will also be available on DISH's new over-the-top product when it launches. We see this as a huge plus, providing us with early-mover advantages we, along with Dish, strive to reach millennials who are choosing alternative sources to access video content.","We also have a new agreement with Netflix that will make our valuable lifestyle content available to their nearly 40 million subscribers across the U.S. And we have a new multiyear agreement with the National Cable Television Cooperative for all 6 of our networks that includes affiliate fee increases that better reflect their value and expand both our television and digital viewer bases. As a result of these deals, we now have almost 100% of our distribution under TV Everywhere agreements, a figure that leads the industry.","Now looking at network performance. Ken mentioned the ongoing success that HGTV is experiencing. HGTV continues to lead as a destination for women, and during the third quarter, was the #3 rated cable network in primetime in the demo. That's up 3 spots from last year. In the broader category of adults 25 to 54, HGTV has ranked as a top 10 cable network for 6 consecutive months, and as Ken noted, continues to be the top network for upscale women. HGTV's strength lies in its development of a broad programming slate that attracts an upscale female audience all day, night and weekend. It's a strategy that helps avoid the sharp ratings peaks and valleys that can occur from network's dependent on one or 2 hot shows or for networks that depend only on primetime.","There are no weak links on weekends at HGTV, as HGTV ranked as the #1 network for women for the first time in that daypart. HGTV draws almost as large an audience on weekends, as it does in primetime. And that effectively provides us with 2 primetimes for ad sales, a huge advantage for us.","Over at Food Network, the brand just keeps getting stronger, touching millions of consumers across multiple platforms on television, in print, online, mobile, at the country's biggest food festivals. This is a brand that people respect and respond to. In the third quarter, Food Network finished #5 among all cable networks in our target female demo and #11 among adult viewers. Weekends continue to show amazing strength, especially among women, as the female audience grew 12% year-over-year.","As with HGTV, the weekend audience on Food Network offers our ad sales team additional, valuable inventory. What's more, strong weekends provide a potent marketing platform to promote primetime and to test new concepts.","Moving on to Travel Channel. Our repositioning continues there, as we reshape the network to highlight programming that reinforces brand identity and attracts an upscale demo. We're building a consistent night-to-night environment that reflects the Travel Channel brand. And here's just one example of how it's working. Summer-themed travel programming on Sunday nights drove a 10% increase in viewership year-over-year. Overall, third quarter audience median income was the highest Travel Channel has seen since 2011. These are the kind of viewer experiences we believe will establish Travel Channel's credibility as a must-see, must-have lifestyle brand. And looking ahead, we anticipate launching more than 20 new series in 2015 that highlight unique people, places and cultures all over the world. These, we believe, will continue to build an upscale audience at Travel Channel.","DIY Network continues its upward trend and enjoyed the best third quarter in its history. August was particularly strong, including the network's highest-rated single night ever. Additionally, Holmes Makes It Right delivered one of the highest-rated telecasts of any series in network history, and that show, by the way, is the #1 program on the network, and it continues to attract new viewers and growth. More people are able to see our great DIY Network programming, thanks to recent carriage agreements, I mentioned earlier, that expand its availability to a substantial number of new households.","Likewise, Cooking Channel has seen the benefit of increased distribution, and the channel is stronger than ever. The programming team at Cooking Channel routinely scours the web and other resources to recognize developing trends and identify compelling talent. We've succeeded in reducing the median age of the audience by bringing in some new talent, like online superstar Laura Vitale, who's new show Simply Laura, premiered in September. Viewers also enjoyed returning favorites and newcomers like Carnival Eats and Ultimate Food Showdown.","At Great American Country, we continue to see the fruits of our decision to develop a new lifestyle channel. The network has seen year-over-year ratings gains for 8 of the past 9 months, and for the quarter, was the fifth fastest-growing network in cable, as ratings rose 33%. Great American Country is attracting more upscale viewers, and the median income is raising, not only are more upscale viewers watching, more viewers are sampling and watching longer.","Now on the international front. We continue to make strategic investments in content and distribution in areas where we see growth potential. Just a few weeks ago, we announced an agreement to launch Food Network in Brazil, our first venture into Latin America, and I'm happy to report that launch occurred this week. We recently renewed a multi-territory distribution agreement with Liberty Global to expand delivery of Food Network, Travel Channel and Fine Living across Europe on multiple platforms, including television, on-demand and mobile. HGTV will debut in the Asia Pacific region early next month, a move that marks the network's first 24\/7 launch outside of North America. We're pleased with the enthusiasm which our content has received around the world as we look for future opportunities in the international marketplace.","At Scripps Networks Interactive, we are building on our strengths, exploiting our opportunities and moving full speed ahead to create a sound future.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe and Lori to discuss the financials.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. Now all the positive trends that Burton just mentioned contributed to another good quarter for the company and for the shareholders. Consolidated revenues were up 4.5%, driven by growth in both advertising and affiliate fees. Advertising revenue was up 5.4%, and affiliate fees were up 3.8% compared with the last year. Now all these growth rates were consistent with the expectations that we had outlined previously.","Total company expenses were up 5.5%, which was better than we expected, as the reduction in SG&A expenses partially offset an increase in cost of services. Our cost of services was up 16%, primarily due to the planned increase in premiered programming during the quarter. SG&A expenses were down 5.3% compared with the prior year, as we continue to remove costs from our support structure. I'll talk more about that in a minute.","Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.93 compared with $0.87 in the prior year third quarter. Our earnings per share got a lift from our share buyback program. We repurchased 3.1 million shares at a cost of $250 million. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $850 million remaining under our present authorization. We remain committed to a more efficient capital structure, increasing leverage on the balance sheet by repurchasing shares, deploying capital internationally and exploring other attractive strategic investment opportunities.","Now finally, as Ken mentioned, we are reviewing our current operating structure to enable us to focus our resources on producing the world's best lifestyle video content, while at the same time, reducing our support costs. We expect to complete this project in the coming weeks. As part of that process, we offered early retirement to certain qualified employees, and we expect to complete the company-wide review process by year-end. This process would likely result in a charge against earnings in the fourth quarter.","With that, I'm going to turn it over to Lori, who's going to drill down into results.","Lori A. Hickok","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing more detail on the revenue drivers for the third quarter. The 5.4% advertising revenue growth was driven by the overall strength of the scatter market, the 2013\/14 upside in the U.S., and increasing contribution international properties. Scatter-versus-scatter, CPM pricing was up mid to high single-digit year-over-year and end up mid- to high-teens over the broadcast upfront.","As for advertising categories. Our top 5 were food, retail, consumer package goods, auto and financial. Affiliate fee revenue grew 3.8%, driven by the annual escalators in our affiliate agreements and our international expansion. Looking at our network performance in the U.S., revenues were up 4.2% on advertising and affiliate fee growth. Our domestic advertising revenues were up 5%, and affiliate fee revenues were up 3.2%. Lifestyle Media segment expenses were up 6%. Cost of services was up 15% due to the planned increase in premier programming during the quarter, that Joe previously mentioned. SG&A expenses were down 5.5% compared with the prior year, as we continue to see greater efficiency in our support operations. Segment profit for U.S. networks was up 2.5% from the prior year period.","Included in our consolidated results, our international businesses generated $24 million of revenue, up 10% from the prior year, primarily due to the expanded distribution and growth in our existing international operations. International advertising was up 26%, and affiliate fees were up 14%. Our equity in earnings of affiliates was $18 million, up 16% from last year. Our international partnerships in Canada and the United Kingdom comprised slightly less than half of equity earnings.","And now looking at the rest of the year. We expect to be at the low end of our full year consolidated revenue guidance that we previously issued. That expectation is based on the current scatter market pricing of flat to low single-digit CPM increases, the new 2014\/15 upfront with mid-single-digit CPM increases over the prior year upfront and the recent Netflix deal. On the expense side. Excluding the impact from our review projects, we expect to be within our previously issued guidance ranges for cost of services and SG&A. For all other items, we are reaffirming our previously issued guidance.","And with that, we're ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] For our first question today, we'll go to John Janedis with Jefferies Inc.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Ken, you probably had the best ratings in the industry from a portfolio perspective in a market where there's a lot of discussion and concerns around measurement issues and other things. What do you view as a key differentiator? Have you upped the new hours? And can you give us your updated views on measurement in general?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, John, good morning. Let me tee it up, and I'm going to let Burton dig in a little bit, since he's involved on a day-to-day basis with our programming folks. Look, I think the one thing that does allow us to stay in of the part is consistency. We day to day stay on brand, and I think viewers know they can depend on our channels for that consistency and that quality content. I think it differentiates us a bit from a lot of the other content that's out there. Much of it is scripted, so the nonfiction nature of our programming, I think, is lending itself to the consistent rating performance you're seeing and the quality results. But I'll let Burton talk a little bit about some of the changes we have seen in some of the ratings issues, but also why he thinks that we're having this performance.","Burton F. Jablin","Well, thanks, Ken. And John, when you get right down to it, it's the quality of the content. If you put on good shows and they're on a environment that's consistent with good promotions, strong marketing, people are going to watch, and it's that straightforward. I give all credit to our programming teams from making that happen. On the measurement issue, you're, I'm sure, reading all the things we are and we're engaged, obviously, with Nielsen and others who try to sort through some of the questions surrounding measurement. We have those questions, too. I would just say things are still being sorted out, and of course, we're looking forward to seeing everybody getting a handle on this so there's greater clarity. But within that environment, we can only do the thing we know how to do best. As Ken said, we're consistent. We deliver a great product. We deliver a great audience, and obviously, viewers and advertisers respond to that.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Maybe one quick one for Joe, if you don't mind. You talked about the operating structure. Given your outperformance, though, from a revenue perspective, is this indicative of your long-term outlook for your growth or industry growth? And are there any changes in the way you're going to market from a sales perspective?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Answer the first -- the latter part of that first. No, there's no change in that. I think we're trying to be smarter as we go, but that's sort of standard operating procedure for us. The first part of your question, I think the answer is also, no. It's not really a reflection of our longer-term outlook. It's more about us reallocating resources from support activities to things that advertisers and consumers actually see, which is the programming and the marketing. So we much rather put money to work there than on the latest and greatest new back office system. And I think that's essentially what you're seeing here.","Operator","We'll take questions now from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","It's for Lori. In your prepared remarks, you guys talked about expanded distribution agreements with the MVPDs. If we look at the numbers on the affiliate side, the 3.2% growth in the quarter was a bit of a deceleration. So just trying to, in my mind, reconcile that with underlying trends. And I wonder, I guess, your blended rates are probably going up by more than 3.2%, so can you talk about any sort of subscriber decline that you saw in the quarter and what might be driving that and how that will pace going forward? And then a follow-up for Ken. I guess, broadly and more strategically, you guys have an investment in multichannel network Tastemade on YouTube. I just wonder if you could talk more about that, maybe the psychology behind that investment. And as you weigh an ad-supported online strategy versus perhaps an over-the-top strategy that many of your peers are pursuing, can you just talk about your online strategy in light of that and whether it can be a meaningful opportunity in the future?","Lori A. Hickok","Yes, Anthony, what we're seeing in the numbers is probably not going to be surprising to anyone on the phone, to what you're probably seeing Comcast and Time Warner and Direct. We're basically holding our own as an industry. There's slight decreases, but there's shift between where subscribers are actually buying their product and bundled product from. Again, what you're seeing with us do is, basically, make sure we're everywhere that subscribers are. So that's why we're out there looking at Netflix and different things. So we really want to get our quality content in all the different distribution platforms. You're not going to see a lot of a lift right now from those deals. Those are more future looking, and where it's hard to predict what the take rate is going to be on those. And we did expect a deceleration that we're seeing now throughout the year. So really, nothing really to see here, other than we think there's a lot of opportunity with the new platforms that are emerging. We think that the -- our partners and distributors are doing things to enrich their products and continue to have a great environment for consumers for years to come. So -- and then we've got a great distribution team led by Henry Ahn. He's out there making sure we get the best value for our product, with all of the traditional and new distributors alike.","Kenneth W. Lowe","And Anthony, as far as the second part of your question, I think -- look, it's really in our DNA to always be looking and thinking about where the consumer's going to be going, what new things they want to be watching, especially -- and it certainly is a buzz word in the industry where millennials are, where they're going to be, et cetera. And we've always taken this approach. That's why we launched DIY. That's why we created Cooking Channel around HGTV and Food. So when you see what we're doing with uLive, some of our YouTube channels, to your point, an investment in TasteMade, as Burton mentioned, one of the hottest up-and-coming \"YouTube stars\" Laura Vitale, we signed her up for the Cooking Channel. It's just constantly trying to be innovative and open-minded about potential opportunities. Having said all of that, at the end of the day, I'll go back to John's question. Right now, our networks are being very successful because of our consistency and that quality content that we're always experimenting around. So these are just opportunities. They're ways for us to, in some cases, do some small investments, do some learning through a TasteMade. But fundamentally, it gets back to the fact that we have these powerful brands so that we have to keep thinking about how do we feed new viewers in over the coming years, and what's the way to tap into some of their behavior lifestyle changes. And to me, it's what we've been doing for 20 years. It's just technology that's changing in a way.","Operator","We'll go now to the line of David Joyce with Evercore.","David Carl Joyce - Evercore ISI, Research Division","I was wondering, on your programming strategy, are you taking a new view on what you're producing or how you're producing such that the content can be more globally transportable now that you've got an increasing global platform? Just wondering if there's any shift there, if there's anything that is meaningful to the expenses on the programming front because of that?","Burton F. Jablin","Yes, thanks, David, good question. We actually are in a great position already, because we're finding much of the content that we produce domestically is being very well-received around the world. So that's nice to begin with. Internally, we are absolutely looking to try to do more coproductions with our international partners. We have a long history of that actually at HGTV and Food Network with our Canadian partners, and so we're very used to doing that sort of thing. Obviously, with different languages around the world, that adds a bit of a wrinkle to it, but nothing that we can't work out when we work together. So we would expect to see more coproductions, joint programming, and attempts to use content domestically around the world and vice versa. There are great concepts out there internationally that we would hope to bring back to the United States as well.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffatNathanson.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","I have one for the team. Maybe, just to Ken, then I have another one for Ken. Just for the team and Ken, given the guidance on scatter pricing -- over scatter pricing last year into the fourth quarter, what do you think are the factors driving kind of the lower pricing environment? We usually don't see fourth quarter pricing to be as soft as it is. And then secondly, Ken, as you shifted from Amazon to Netflix, was there anything besides just a better deal or price that made you to go to Netflix? Is it a wider platform for you, international possibly? So sort of that like what you thought of that in switching from Amazon to Netflix?","Kenneth W. Lowe","I'll let Burton take the first part of that question, Michael.","Burton F. Jablin","Yes, well, if you go back, and look, consistently, fourth quarter actually has been one of the slowest growth quarters in advertising over the last couple of years. So really, this is a fairly consistent pattern. What we might say is slightly different this time around is that there's some macro issues in the world that have kept some advertisers on the sidelines, whether it's Ebola or war or elections, you name it. But that always create some degree of uncertainty in the marketplace, and then we've also seen a trend that we saw in the up front of advertisers wanting to sort of hold off on buying as much as they can to maintain flexibility. That said, we are seeing some nice signs in the fourth quarter in terms of more scatter business later into the quarter than we typically see, probably evidence of their efforts to sort of wait as long as they can before they put their money on the table. But we'll hope that, that trend continues, and that's a nice thing to see at this point.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, and I think, Michael, the only thing I'd add to that, I mean, you know this, as the fourth quarter consistently always shows, at least the past few years, the slowest year-over-year percentage growth. And this year, I think, everything Burton has alluded to is kind of adding into that a little uncertainty, but not all of that unusual for fourth quarter. Back to your question on Amazon and Netflix. It's a little, Michael, back to Anthony's comment, as we look at -- whether it's Amazon or Netflix and some of these deals, to us, it's not an enormous amount of cash. And you've heard me say this consistently, we've been very cautious here. It's archived. It's library content. We're very careful about the agreements we have with our distribution partners, so it's really more of a learning curve and how much information, how much data, if you will, that we get back in some of these deals. They're short term. We're trying to learn through the largest platform right now, Netflix versus Amazon, what the demands may be for our content in the future. We know it's going to be there. The shorter form, the type, the style, just the way we actually produce things. So it's really a bit of a learning curve for us. You'll continue to see us do some of these things. As I mentioned to you earlier, but it's all about continuing to feed the core and the major brands and going forward. So it's not sometimes driven so much by dollars and cents, but what's the total takeaway from those type of deals.","Operator","You will now go to the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just circling back on your commentary about how you all benefit from more live viewership, which clearly has great success in terms of your ratings performance. But is there also a better pricing dynamic because of that live viewership, I would assume, was more of an issue of capturing that audience, the value of that viewership also goes up and maybe your CPM is widening a bit versus more traditional sort of original programming? So it's my first question. And then the second question is just circling back on your comments just now on the fourth quarter. Advertising market where you said that scatter pricing has softened a bit for all those reasons you listed. Are -- is the volume also a little bit lower? Or do you think it's just coming in more last-minute?","Burton F. Jablin","Well, this is Burton, Alexia. So on the first question, I think it's a combination of things that affect our pricing and our ability to outperform the market typically, and that's the things we talk about all the time, the stability of the ratings, consistency of the environment, the high-quality programming, the high-quality audience. The live part certainly helps because advertisers really want their messages to reach an audience at a particular time, presumably will pay a premium for that in addition to all those other factors. So it all kind of works together, and our sales team does a fantastic job of leveraging all of those attributes. On volume, as we have said, a couple of times now, fourth quarter is a period of lower growth rates in advertising. We're seeing pretty much the same pattern here. We might be, as I said earlier, see -- we are seeing some of that volume come in a little later. Now whether we'll see it continue at that pace for the rest of the quarter, we don't know. We expect to see a continuation of that, but we're pretty much tracking in the fourth quarter, as previous fourth quarters tracked, in terms of the way advertising behaves, and the lower rate of increase.","Lori A. Hickok","And Alexia, I'll just add, that we've seen strong demand. There's a lot of scatter out there, if you remember, in the upfront. Much to what Burton said, they held back, they held back probably disproportionately in the fourth quarter, pushing it into later quarters in the upfront, so I think you're seeing -- that's a piece that you're seeing with the increased scatter market to, which will have an impact on pricing.","Operator","And we'll go now to the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess 2 questions, one on the advertising side, one on the affiliate side. First, on the affiliate side, can you talk about the order of magnitude and timing of the Netflix money? If you can give us that. And second, on the advertising side, I may have missed it, but did you actually talk about what the kind of pacing number was for domestic advertising in the fourth quarter?","Lori A. Hickok","Yes, I can take on the affiliate one. Basically, you can see that evenly spread. I wouldn't call it large numbers. Again, like both Burton and Ken have said, this is more learning and incremental. The dollars are nice and their additive, but they're not on a $2 billion company and not going to have a huge impact. But they're nice and additive, much like we keep adding new things. But you'll see that evenly spread over the shorter-term deal. You're not going to see like a onetime, which you see is the sum. So that's going to be over the deal. On the advertising pacing thing, really, what we're seeing is, again, just a lot more buying -- being bought into the fourth quarter. It's just a shift, I think, from how they're buying, which fits a little bit with that closer to market time for advertisers. So fourth quarter, I think they're looking at year-end results, looking at what they need to do. I think there's a lot of factors just playing in through the fourth quarter pacing. But what we're seeing is actually increased demand on the scatter. It's just a matter of -- it's coming in slower because the upfront was slower, so I think we're just seeing a slower market, but still pretty healthy appetite out there.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But is there a specifically -- in terms of ad growth, like, is it sort of running consistently still in that mid-singles range? Or...","Lori A. Hickok","We don't really give those numbers. We've just given you there's kind of the volumes looking pretty healthy, little slower to that, and we gave you some of the pricing. So we're still thinking that it's just slower and that the quarter is going to look good. Now what it comes back to is that we're still -- we gave you some guidance around our full year expectation, so I think from that you might be able to determine some color from that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Could you talk a little more about your -- what you're doing on the SG&A side. Is that being motivated more to try and drive some margin expansion? Or is this about freeing up dollars to be able to spend more on programming?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes, Doug, that was the nature of the cut exactly. We're not looking to expand margins just to expand margin, but we certainly feel like it's appropriate for us to free up money from, call it, support activities and make it available for more programming.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Could you talk at all about sort of how you see programming cost spending going over the next 2 to 3 years?","Lori A. Hickok","Yes. Well, actually, we see it decelerating somewhat. I think we're still investing there. It's still our top driver of growth, but I think looking at where we are, we're feeling pretty comfortable with the hours that we have, looking at the mix. We still will continue to invest in Travel Channel, so we continue to invest there. But I think you're going to see some deceleration over the next couple of years.","Operator","Next will be from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","You mentioned the affiliate renewals with DISH and with NCTC, both of which had some more contentious negotiations with some of your cable network peers. I'm curious when,-- first, when do you expect the impact of those new agreements to show up in your financials? Second of all, I know you don't talk in detail about specific deals, but is it fair to assume that these agreements are going to drive some acceleration in your affiliate growth relative to your run rate so far this year? And I don't know, maybe, can you characterize a bit more how those discussions went or were going. Just given that the commentary in the market is that they're getting increasingly difficult and that the distributors are getting increasingly selective about who they're taking on as partners, I think it's a positive to see that you're able to get those deals done. Just if you have any color there, we appreciate it.","Lori A. Hickok","Well, I would have to say that Henry and his team did a great job. They definitely -- I think we said in our remarks derived more value, so I think we had a very successful deal. We don't get to what the actual rates are there, but we were very pleased with that. We will see those -- the impact of that showing in our results for the next couple of years based on the terms of the deal, but we were very pleased and we really got more value, much better than the CPMs, the CPI kind of increases. But -- and also, there's other things that we don't talk about that really also add value to the deal. So we were very pleased. I think our partners were pleased, and Henry and his team did a fabulous job on getting that done. And then, as you say, those are never easy deals to get completed. So I don't know if there's much more than that, other than we will see good results coming over the coming years as a result of those.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Michael, I might just add, we really do -- we've said it for a long time, we really, really do believe in the partnership that we've created with these distribution folks over the years. Whether it's Tom at Charter or Mike at DirecTV or Charlie at DISH, and just go down the line, we're all in this to advance the business model. And the better we were able to come together to understand it's a win-win, the content that we have, our distributors know it's a value to their consumers and know it's going to continue to be a value, as technology gives us additional opportunities, both on the distribution side and the content side to engage with consumers. And that's kind of this transition we're going through a little bit, if you will. But at the end of the day, we work very hard at keeping these partnerships on a positive side because it's in our best interest and we think their best interest, too.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Could you -- just to clarify, sorry, if I missed it, but will these deals begin to impact your financials in the fourth quarter? And what about the length of the agreements, are they -- how do they compare to what you've seen in the past? Are they getting any longer or shorter?","Lori A. Hickok","Well, we typically don't disclose the length of these deals, but I would actually say the impact will start more next year than they will this year, so you'll see them going forward.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to pick up on the TV Everywhere comments that you made, Ken or anybody who wants to readdress them. So it sounds like you're nearly fully distributed with that type of service, so I wondered if you could share with us whatever you know about the usage of that, and I also just wondered if you feel like it's being promoted or the awareness of it exists relative to the desire everybody says they have for that product, but it feels like it's being a little bit kept a secret. So anything you can share about the progress of that and the usage of it would be fantastic.","Burton F. Jablin","Well, thanks for that question, Todd, this is Burton. I think you're generally right and that we do have a responsibility as partners with our distributors to do our best to promote the TV Everywhere product. We certainly believe in it. As a company, you're going to see us ramping up our promotion. We do have industry-leading 100% coverage, and so this is a great product. And now that we have that 100% coverage, we feel it's the right time to begin to aggressively promote it. So you're going to see that. We're also going to be rolling out live streaming of our networks in the TV Everywhere footprint next year, which gives us even more of a marketing push that we can trumpet. And so we agree with the premise of your question, that this is a product that's a great value to consumers. We think we'll do very well, because consumers love watching our networks. And now, they'll be able to watch them even more in more places, on more devices.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So -- and if you don't mind -- thanks, Burton. And just, if you don't mind, just a quick follow-up on that. So just to understand the form of it, so you talked about live streaming as an aspect of that will be coming more, which means that as it exists now, it must be more sort of a on-demand, obviously, offering. Is it mostly ad-supported at this point? And how have you worked with your distributors to figure out how that advertising works, assuming it exists?","Burton F. Jablin","That's a good question, and I'll give you a clarification. There is live streaming on the distributor TV Everywhere apps and services, we're going to add it to our own apps and services. So there'll be even more opportunity for viewers to access the live stream of the network. On-demand, it depends. It carries the commercial load off television in that C3 window, and then we have dynamic ad insertion.","Operator","Let's go now to the line of Laura Martin with Needham.","Laura A. Martin - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So let me build on a couple of other questions. So going back to DISH, it's really impressive you got that deal done. And I'm wondering, Ken, they're trying to do a strip-down or what we call a smaller bundle. And I know you don't comment on contract terms, but are you supportive? Do you think that's a good idea to offer consumers sort of a smaller bundle than the full, sort of traditional bundle? And then following up on that, sort of with an over-the-top question, which is, you've been very supportive of ecosystem and the TV Everywhere. Did those contracts you're signing preclude you, 5 years from now or 3 years from now, from actually taking your share of those, bundle them together and go in over the top, like a $10 price point?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Laura, thank you. Well, first off, yes, I think on the, specifically, the DISH over-the-top, we still believe in the bigger bundle, and it's obvious now that we're starting to see some of the pricing in these individual streaming model is that the bundle turns out to be a pretty good value. We said it all along. So that's first and foremost our support. We support what Charlie and the DISH folks are doing because we think, again, you've got to kind of push the envelope a little bit and find out if there are other ways, if there are other folks out there that currently might not be subscribing to satellite or cable that would pick up something like the over-the-top model that Dish is putting together, some others that are obviously going to be coming along. You'll hear more about those and our partnerships with those down the road. So it's back to a recurring theme of questions today, and that's a learning curve and us making sure that we're being supportive of our distribution partners as they try to look to push where there is TV Everywhere, over-the-top models, et cetera. But fundamentally, we're still very much about the larger bundle and the value that it creates. As far as your second question, it's really difficult to get into that because we really don't disclose our contracts, and if you don't mind, I'd rather just pass on that. But let's put it this way, again, I think, going forward, both our distribution partners and us as content providers are going to be open to new and interesting ways to reach consumers. And the technology that is at our fingertips is going to allow us to expand that. So I think we'll both take advantage of it, but I'd rather not get into specific contractual terms.","Laura A. Martin - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's understandable. Sony -- CBS announced that they have a new deal with Sony and at a very premium price point, even over the Intel deal, the virtual. So are you supportive of MVPDs that are coming over-the-top at a higher price point?","Kenneth W. Lowe","We are, because again, it's just another opportunities to reach consumers, different platforms be it PlayStation, whatever...","Joseph G. NeCastro","Dual revenue.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, and as Joe just reminded me, of course, the dual revenue stream, because advertising is still going to be an important part of that which, needless to say, is an important part of our financial model going forward. So the short answer is, yes.","Operator","We'll go now to the line of Ben Mogil with Stifel.","Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So a lot of the questions have sort of been answered already. Just wanted to ask you about Travel. So you talked a lot about, sort of the go forward, getting a higher end commodity and obviously trying to program and quote advertisers around that. Do you see sort of the quarter numbers and possibly even 4Q numbers, as you're still not at transition point, sort of curious the upbeat commentary against that and against revenue number that was down in the quarter?","Burton F. Jablin","Yes, I appreciate the question, and basically the answer is, yes. It is a network, but still in transition. We've seen this movie before, with other networks, with our networks, where it takes a little time to get them where they need to be. We fully expected that we would see a little bit of a slowdown for travel in the third quarter because we are ramping up the introduction of all the new programming that I mentioned more than 20 new shows beginning this month and continuing right through 2015. This is the largest slate of new programming ever to be introduced to Travel Channel. In fact, it's one of the largest slates of new programming ever to be introduced to one of our networks, and we have very high level of confidence that these new shows are going to be a hit with the audience and particularly the upscale audience that we're trying to reach. I should say that within the Travel Channel's ratings, we see some very positive signs already with the kinds of scheduling moves that the team at Travel Channel has made to create a much more consistent viewing experience, with the programming we already have. So meaning income is going up, the consistency of viewing night-to-night and week-to-week has increased. We're seeing some very, very nice trends there, and we expect that to get even better, as we introduce this slate of new programming.","Benjamin E. Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And then just sort of one follow-up. In terms of the movement of Amazon to Netflix. I'm not sure if Amazon shared more ratings with you. Netflix obviously doesn't. But when you look what you sort of saw, I mean, obviously, I'm guessing you didn't see a lot of ratings erosion. Did you actually see any shows that actually got a pick up on live or on C+ view ratings, because of sort of the Amazon viewing experience, so to speak?","Burton F. Jablin","It's Burton, again. I would have to go back and dig into the data to know whether it was a material impact. I mean the bottom line is what you referred to. We really didn't see any erosion at all in terms of our on-air viewing. And so in our estimation, the SVOD world is additive and a nice one for us to explore.","Operator","We'll go now to the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Hersh Khadilkar - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Hersh Khadilkar on for Ben, actually. Just a couple of quick questions for Lori. I think your '14 expense guidance includes project expenses -- or sorry, excludes project expenses. Can you give us an idea of what those were last year? I think they were somewhere around $30 million. And whether you expect that to be up or down this year? And I guess, that would mean we backed that expense out of both this year and last. And then, just a follow-up on programming spend, it was up 19% year-to-date. I know it can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but can you give us an idea of your full year expectation for spend on programming?","Lori A. Hickok","Yes, back to your first question on the project spending, we were referring more to the review we were going through in the early retirement, not the investment we were spending for things like uLive, International. Those were really, I think, what you're backing out. Now understanding what your question is, those are fairly comparable year-to-year, maybe slightly increased, but they were already in our guidance. What's not in our guidance is the impact, which is too early to quantify, related to some of the actions we're doing around the support structure that we talked about and trying to free up resources to apply to programming and other growth initiatives. From that, that will help us for the next 20 years. As far as the programming spend, that's always going to be lumpy, because the spend is usually out in front of the actual premieres when it shows up in our financial statements. Again, you just heard Burton talking about the big push at Travel Channel, so we would have a lot of cash spending going out, hitting our balance sheet right now, that, that programming is not going to at all hit the air this year. Some of it will hit next year. So again, it'll be a little bit lumpy. It's always lumpy, but what I would guide you to was an earlier comment that we expect our programming amortization and spend to decelerate as we look to the next 2 to 3 years.","Operator","I'll go to the line of Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Lori, a follow up on the programming cost growth. Can you tell us what programming costs growth is excluding Travel Channel? And how soon would you expect Travel Channel to converge with the total -- the growth rate in expenses to converge with the total programming cost growth? And what would be the driver of that? Is it fewer hours? Or not as many hours increases? Or cost per hour?","Lori A. Hickok","Yes. Well, typically we will not disclose what portion of that. In fact, I wouldn't know off the top of my head. But we do know that Travel is helping to drive some of that increase. And you'll continue to see Travel increase as we move towards -- and hopefully, the top line is improving towards a Food or HGTV. So we think they're in a good place right now, as far as where they are in ratings. And as we see success there, we will continue to invest in Travel and continue to make those investments. But we feel fairly stable on our other networks, and we'll continue to work within the budget. Again, I would just point back to see deceleration over the next coming years on that.","Operator","And our final question we'll take today is from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities.","Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","With reference to most of your channels, I don't think the production cost for 4K make a lot of sense. But for Travel, it feels like a natural fit, trying to get to more affluent demographic, just like sports, sort of an immersive experience. Is that something that you're looking at? And then secondly, when you said the growth rate for advertising Q4 is always slower, that implies either we're getting a lot of tropical disease contagions or bad macro events or either that the seasonality for your consumer products advertisers is changing and are becoming more efficient or rational in distributing the dollars through the years. Is that -- do you think the latter is a fair conclusion? Or do you think it's just kind of random events on the economy or whatever that have allowed this pattern to manifest itself the last few years in Q4?","Burton F. Jablin","This is Burton, I'll try to tackle those. On 4K, we've always worked with our industry partners where there are new technologies, and we have discussions about these things. As far as the broad rollout, we're not anticipating that any time soon. But we're always looking at everything we can do. We were at the forefront when it came to HD, and we've been experimenting with some 3D. So where there's an opportunity, we'll take it with our partners. In ad sales, I really can't add much to what I said. I guess you could speculate on some of those things that you mentioned. All I was saying was, that there is a fairly regular pattern, the way that ad sales growth lays out over the year, and we're seeing not really a change from that pattern this year.","Mark W. Kroeger","All right. Thanks, everyone, this is Mark. Mike and I will be available for follow-ups today. Nick, you can read the replay.

Thank you, Dylan, and good morning, everyone. Very happy you're able to join us today. Scripps Networks Interactive again delivered another quarter of strong operating performance. I could not be prouder of the great work our entire organization has produced so far this year. Just a quick review on the second quarter of 2016, total operating revenues grew 22%. Consolidated advertising revenues grew 29%. Advertising revenues for the U.S. networks increased 9% and surpassed $0.5 billion this quarter for the first time ever. Consolidated adjusted segment profit increased 14%, and we closed a record broadcast upfront that puts the company in a great position for 2017.","Now Burton and Lori will go into details on the quarter in just a few minutes, but first I want to highlight some of the results delivered by our strong brands. HGTV sustained its strong ratings performance and achieved the highest rated second quarter in network history among all the key demographics. The strategy that we've implemented at Travel Channel continues to deliver sustained success with the network's third consecutive quarter of primetime ratings growth. Travel Channel is a powerful brand with great growth potential, and we have exciting plans in place to build on this momentum. And TVN Group delivered another solid quarter, with total market share up 3% over last year, solidifying their position as the leading network group in Poland.","Our family of networks leads the way in lifestyle programming in the United States and around the world. They're really unmatched in the industry for the savvy, well-informed, upscale audiences that they deliver. The record advertising performance we reported today and the record upfront we just closed speak to our leadership in using lifestyle content to connect advertisers with consumers. In the midst of ever changing and expanded viewer options, our networks remain essential to distributors and deliver consistent performance and high quality audiences that our distribution partners seek. The unique nature of our networks and the audiences they attract means that both our ratings and our impressions remain robust.","We're active in the virtual MVPD space, talking with new and prospective entrants as we continue to expand our engagement with audiences on non-traditional linear services. We're also actively extending the reach of our popular TV content as well, with short form originals on the various digital and mobile platforms. Burton will share some of the recent successes we've achieved with Scripps Lifestyle Studios in just a few moments.","On the advertising side, as I mentioned, we recently concluded our upfront negotiations and we're delighted with the results. I just want to say thanks to Steve Gigliotti, John Steinlauf and everyone in our sales organization for the incredible job they're doing. Advertisers are lining up like never before to secure their place in our entertaining and family-friendly programming. And that has resulted in a record-breaking year for that team.","Our International segment continues to deliver impressive results. The teams are hard at work assessing and delivering on the wealth of opportunities available to our Lifestyle brands around the world. Over the past several months, we've expanded our footprint in key markets across South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. For example, we've taken important steps toward the global rollout of HGTV, a key priority for Scripps Networks. In June, HGTV launched in New Zealand. Additionally, we believe there is substantial opportunity for HGTV in Europe. And I'll look forward to us making more announcements on that front in the coming months.","TVN group, Holland's leading multi-platform media business, continues to exceed even our own high expectations. Audience levels are climbing steadily and revenues continues to grow. TVN has proven to be a transformative acquisition, converting our International Network segment into a growing and profitable endeavor as it continues to break new ground developing and monetizing compelling original content for Polish audiences. Today, our international networks, including our TVN portfolio, are distributed in more than 175 countries and territories around the world and broadcast in 29 languages, all on our way to 300 million cumulative subscribers.","Scripps Networks Interactive continues to reach new heights. Couldn't be prouder of all we've accomplished so far in 2016, both at our networks in the United States and at our international networks. And we're really about the prospects for the remainder of the year, and the year ahead are just as positive. And we're very confident in the path ahead. Again, I want to thank you for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive.","And with that, let me turn it over to Burton who has additional details on second quarter results. Burton?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","All right. Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. We continue to perform at a high level and reached some significant milestones in the second quarter. Total day ratings for adults 25 to 54 improved at every one of our six U.S. networks during the quarter. In addition, sales prime ratings were up at five of the six networks. This success story is built on strong consistent networks that deliver on their promise to audiences, day in and day out. This is not a hits driven business, although we have plenty of those, too. Our networks keep viewers watching at a high level through all day parts, and as a result, provide a must-have service to distributors and a must-spend environment to advertisers.","At HGTV it was the highest rated second quarter ever among all key demographics and the third highest-rated quarter ever for sales prime. HGTV extended its leadership position as the number one network for upscale women 25 to 54 in sales prime for nearly 10 consecutive years. In addition, viewership among the key millennials' demographic grew 6% compared with 2015, driven by popular shows like Flip or Flop and Brother vs. Brother. At Food Network, our co-viewing strategy continues to deliver. Co-viewership reached its highest level in over five years with shows like Cake Wars, Kids BBQ Championship and Chopped Junior, appealing to adults and kids alike.","In addition, total day ratings for adults 25 to 54 were up 4% at Food Network in the quarter, thanks to a strategic shift in daytime program scheduling. Coupled with new premieres like Cooks vs. Cons, over time we expect this to help boost primetime viewership, too. Travel Channel is gaining momentum and reported its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sales prime ratings were up an impressive 11% among adults 25 to 54. Ratings grew in six out of seven nights of the week, four of them by more than 20%.","Additionally, time spent viewing on Travel Channel increased by more than 10 minutes, a testament to the moves we've made over the last few months. And our Dive Into Summer programming, which concluded this past Sunday, was an absolute hit with viewers. The stunt helped drive double-digit increases in Sunday prime ratings over the full quarter. Travel Channel represents one of the most significant growth opportunities for the company, and its recent progress reinforces management view that we're advancing the network in the right direction.","DIY Network had another very strong showing, delivering its most watched quarter ever in sales prime among adults 25 to 54. Barnwood Builders and Vanilla Ice Project led the way with strong ratings. Cooking Channel also scored the highest rated and most watched quarter in its history for sales prime among adults and women 25 to 54. The network also set a new record for time spent viewing. Finally, Great American Country had its best quarter in almost nine years, growing ratings by more than 50%.","Our new Scripps Lifestyle Studios continues to pave the digital path for our company, and we saw many successes in the second quarter, including almost 20% growth in U.S. digital revenues. Total digital subscribers on Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat have grown 20% since January, while video views on our Facebook pages have increased 123%.","Food Network continues to show strong growth and demand in its online platforms, where it currently has more than 10 million fans on Facebook and more than 1 million subscribers on its Snapchat Discover channel. In addition, HGTV hit a milestone in June, reaching 5 million fans on Facebook and 1 million followers on Instagram. Now during the quarter, we shifted some organizational responsibilities in the digital group, and brought all content, digital and linear, under the oversight of Chief Content Officer Kathleen Finch as we seek to build audiences across all platforms.","At our international networks, the last several quarters have been especially exciting as the company grows outside the United States. In Poland, TVN had another successful quarter. TVN's family of networks saw revenue growth in the mid-single digits in local currency compared with the prior year. As Ken mentioned, for the second quarter, TVN Group saw its total commercial audience share increase 3%. Also, TVN the broadcast channel strengthened its number one position in its key demographic, reaching 15% market share. TVN 24 has maintained its leadership in Poland among news channels, while thematic networks, TTV and TVN's Fabula, have substantially increased market share over the last six months. TVN is a great fit for our international portfolio. We couldn't be more pleased with the impressive results we've realized to-date.","We're also expanding into new markets. We recently announced the upcoming launch of HGTV for the first time in the EMEA region. The channel will debut in the Middle East and North Africa in November. And late last month, we announced our intent to introduce Food Network and Travel Channel to audiences in Israel for the first time beginning in September. In the second quarter, UKTV achieved a 10% share of commercial impacts for the first time in its history, and was the fastest-growing network group in the UK.","2016 continues to set new records for the company. As we grow, we're redoubling our efforts to create an ever deeper connection with our consumers across all of our brands.","And now I'll turn it over to Lori, who will review the company's financial performance.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. Since you've seen our results, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance and then open it up for Q&A. Consolidated revenues in the second quarter totaled $893 million, an increase of 22% compared with the prior year. The growth was primarily driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, coupled with ratings improvement and the expansion of our international business through the acquisition of TVN last year.","Consolidated adjusted segment profit increased 14%, fueled by the strong revenue growth during the second quarter and the inclusion of TVN. Consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 8% compared with the prior year. The improvement in adjusted EPS was primarily due to the improved operating performance, which was partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with the financing for the acquisition of TVN, as well as the assumed debt of TVN and lower equity and earnings of affiliates driven by the sale of our investment in Fox Sports South in the first quarter of 2016.","At our U.S. network segment, revenues increased 5%, driven by strong advertising demand for our lifestyle network, partially offset by a decline in distribution revenues. For advertising revenues, increases in CPM pricing, coupled with ratings improvements, drove a 9% year-over-year increase in the second quarter. Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter, with CPMs up mid- to high-teens year-over-year and up mid to high 20% over the broadcast upfront. Our top five advertising categories during the quarter were food, retail, automotive, home improvement and consumer packaged goods. These categories are consistent with the historical performance of the second quarter.","As Ken mentioned earlier, our ad sales team achieved a record-setting upfront. We drove both rate and volume without using any additional inventory. We expect to achieve low-double digit price increases on the same amount of inventory as last year. The strength of scatter market has continued into the third quarter. Scatter versus scatter CPM pricing is up mid- to high-teens year-over-year, and up high 20%s over the calendar upfront.","Industry subscriber declines and the previously disclosed one-time rate equalization of certain distributor agreements related to consolidations drove a 4% decrease in U.S. networks distribution revenues. The declines in rates and subscribers were partially offset by previously negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top broadband providers.","During the second quarter, we finalized a long-term agreement with one of our biggest distributors, which resulted in a one-time true-up during the quarter. This does not impact our full year revenue outlook. Overall, we are extremely pleased with how the negotiations concluded. Looking forward, this deal in combination with other previously negotiated deals sets the company up for mid-to-high single-digit rate growth in the future. On the expense side, cost of services for the U.S. networks increased 18%, as planned, in the second quarter as a result of our continued investment in the quality and variety of programming on our networks.","We noted last quarter that we shifted some marketing and promotional expenses to later quarters. Due to the continued advertising strength and ratings improvements, we were once again able to defer marketing expenses out of the second quarter. We still expect to spend these marketing dollars, but it will be later in the year. Reflecting the increase in advertising revenues, mostly offset by increases in programming-related expenses, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. networks increased 1%.","International networks revenues increased significantly to $147 million from $22 million due to the inclusion of TVN in the second quarter of 2016. TVN revenues grew by mid-single digits in local currency compared with the same time a year ago. International adjusted segment profit was $37 million, compared with an adjusted segment loss of $10 million in the second quarter of 2015. This $47 million improvement is primarily due to the inclusion of TVN. As a reminder, TVN historically operates at higher margins in the second and fourth quarters, and at lower margins in the first and third quarters.","In addition to our consolidated results, we have international operations reported in our equity earnings. In total, equity and earnings of affiliates was $22 million, down 20% compared with the prior year. The decline is primarily related to the sale of our investment in Fox Sports South earlier this year.","On the balance sheet I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the second quarter at approximately 2.9 times growth leverage, down from 3.2 times at the end of 2015. Also, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We plan to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our leverage and invest in M&A both domestically and internationally. Given those goals, we do not buy back any shares during the quarter.","Now for our 2016 full year guidance which is based on consolidated company results. Grounded in the results we have seen to date, we are reiterating all of our previously issued guidance.","And with that, we are ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead, sir.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks, and good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Lori \u2013 or a couple related for Lori and then maybe a follow-up for Burton. So Lori, just wanted to ask about the 4% decline in U.S. distribution revenue. If you exclude the one-time rate equalization that you cited, what would affiliate rate growth have been in the 2Q? And then relatedly in the past, and I think just now in your prepared remarks you said that you expect distribution revenue growth to revert to mid- to high-single digit growth I think in the future. So I'm wondering if you could bridge for us the 4% decline in the 2Q with the expectation for mid- to high-single digit growth in the future. For example, what's the expectation for distribution revenue for the balance of the year? So why don't we start with those, and then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay, Anthony. Quite a few questions embedded into one big question, I think. But generally, what we're looking at \u2013 and I'll remind you that we were not surprised by this rate equalization impact this year. Just as we finalize agreements, you'll see some lumpiness in how we record things but I think I would point again to our full year guidance. We're still on track. And as we look at the back half, I think it would be fair to say as we continue to see the impact from equalizations, that we would see maybe low single digit declines as we go out of 2016.","So as we look into 2017 we are quite encouraged based on the deals that we've done. And again, that's what I was referring to is that with the agreements we've done including the one that we just concluded, that we expect mid to high single digit price CAGRs for the foreseeable future. And these are fairly long contracts so we think that our carriage has been secured, as well as that we've gotten great price increases that are representative of the brands and the product that we bring to distributors' bundles. And again, I think I would point to \u2013 we've had a great year, and I think the resounding success we've had in driving impressions is seen by distributors as well as they look at what to put in their bundles.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So again, we've been calling. It's going to be a little bit of a choppy 2016...","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Right.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...but we're feeling very good based on the agreements that we've struck looking as we lap those in 2017 and beyond.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Lori.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, Anthony, I would \u2013 and I would refer to our full year guidance to keep you kind of in the guard rails.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then just maybe another one. Switching gears a second, there's been a lot in the press about your aggressive counter programming strategy to the Olympics programming. I know I think it's less than a week of Olympics here, but maybe for Burton and\/or Lori, just wanted to get an early kind of update on how that strategy has gone. I know \u2013 has it gone as planned? I mean, do you have any early data points? What has been the impact of the Olympics on your ratings so far? Has it been kind of in line with your expectations for the 3Q impact? Thank you. Thank you, both.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Hi, Anthony. It's Burton. Yeah, we do program during the Olympics. We have viewers who expect us to provide the same kind of content for the two weeks of the Olympics that we do all the time and we do that for them. Really, it's so early, at least from a ratings standpoint. We only have seen one night of ratings from the opening ceremonies.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Right.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Just because the way Nielsen comes out with weekend ratings that \u2013 I can't give you any kind of assessment of how we're doing against the Olympics. But as you said, we program with our viewers in mind and we hope it comes out okay. That said, there are some events at the Olympics that do very well, swimming, gymnastics. So from night to night there'll probably be some variations but overall, we think we'll come through just fine.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Anthony. It's Ken...","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Yeah.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'd like to just one quick follow up because I think there's been a lot of emphasis on \"countering Olympic programming\". When actually, in all fairness to Kathleen and her team, they're looking at an overall full year schedule now that I think it's more aggressive for us across the board, across all of our networks. So Olympics aside, I think part of the reason you're seeing the type of rating improvement and increases you are across all of our networks is a little bit more of a full year strategy, including what we're doing in the summer and some of the summer impacted programming and targeted programming. So I don't want to give Kathleen and her team not enough credit for the fact that we got Olympics here for two and a half weeks when this is more of a year-round strategy.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Understood. Thanks.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay? Thank you, Anthony.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Vasily Karasyov with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Lori, I think my question is for you. You guys in the prepared remarks pointed out how good the revenue trends look for the next year at the U.S. networks. So \u2013 and if we couple that with what you said early about decelerating spending on Travel Channel programming, where do you expect the margin to go in the best case scenario for U.S. networks?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, Vasily, we've already said \u2013 again, it's a little early for us to be predicting 2017, but I think you've highlighted the trends that look really good. I think on the ad front, based on our impressions growth, looking at how well we've done in the upfront, feeling very confident with advertising. And in fact, I think, based on what's going on in the industry we're well positioned with our alliance that we had on driving advertising revenue.","Again, I just spoke that we're going to lap these rate equalizations. So again, on the price front we're feeling very strong. We continue to secure new subscribers and new shelf space across the landscape, as well as look at what we can do on the Lifestyle Studios.","As far as margins, we've been talking about programming. We've been moderating that. We saw some increases over the past few years as we ramped up our spending for Travel Channel. What we've always said is that has moderated. We have looked across the portfolio. But if Kathleen and her team find something that's working and driving investment on the top line, we would make investment at that because it is the best investment we can make overall as a company.","But at that point on the U.S., I think we're very good stewards of our capital and of our expenses. So again, I think it's going be a very good year and we'll give you more on margins as we look at coming out of our budget cycle. But I don't see any big speed bumps looking forward.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Yeah, okay. And a quick...","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","(25:33)","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Yeah, sorry.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is Ken. I have to underscore \u2013 I sound like a broken record but it's important. Because we own the majority of our content and we have a long and very successful track record in not only controlling that spend, but hopefully showing the most efficient ROI in the business on content. It gives us a lot of confidence going forward in the fact that we don't have some of the unknown increases, the sports rights that you maybe have in other type of programming, scripted, et cetera. So that fact continues, I think, to give us great confidence in going forward in our business model.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Quick follow up, then. The repackaging, when a cost of subscriber moves from U-verse to DirecTV, say, and you lose some subscriber count because of retiering. Does that affect your advertising revenue, too?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","I can address that, Vasily. Our impressions continue to grow so the advertising is based on the impressions. And we've got a great impression story. In fact, I don't think I'm bragging to say it's the best in the industry right now outside of what's going on with news and coverage of the political campaigns. So basically, the answer is no. Whatever's happening in the subscriber universe, we'll continue to push ahead with growth and impressions through our great programming, and that's how we're paid by advertising.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you very much.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And Vasily, if I could just add also as well \u2013 and you've heard us talk about this before. As an industry, we're seeing some of this choppiness, but because we're targeted more to a 35-plus audience, we tend to be less impacted by some of the churn, some of the shaving, cord cutting that's possibly going on with the millennial audience which doesn't impact impressions, to Burton's point, as much as you see some of the variations in sub-numbers. So kind of steady as it goes above the water. We're underneath, it's a little choppy. But right now \u2013 and I think the best example I can give you is what Lori cited as a record upfront. We continue to deliver that very strong engaged upscale audience. And as Burton says, as long as impressions are growing, we feel very confident about our position.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you very much.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Go ahead, please.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. I have three pretty quick ones for Lori. Lori, when you said a one-time settlement that means one year, not one quarter, right? So when you say it's lasting, it may be one time but it's over the course of the year, not a quarter? Is that the correct interpretation?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","They're both true. It is impacting us over the entire year. We make estimates that as we finalize agreements you might see a little choppiness as you adjust your estimates. So we might have seen a slightly outsized impact in Q2, but it is a full year that we'll continue to see the impact.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And there were two big consolidations in the industry and your outlook now takes into account the impact from both of those deals, or is there still another deal that has to be put into the numbers?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would say our revenue guidance takes into account all of the consolidation and the impact on our results. This is the choppy year for us and as we get past this year, we're going be set up quite nicely. I think, as I said, based on just looking at those mid to high-single digit price increases. So we continue to take that all into account, and we're looking forward to 2017 on the distribution front.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then lastly, I think Vasily asked this question too, was there a change in the net subscribers from 1Q to 2Q? Discovery said there was a change and Turner said there wasn't, and I wonder is it more about their bundles versus reality. So what was the impact in the change in subscriber growth from 1Q to 2Q?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I'd say across the portfolio it probably was consistent with industry trends, maybe slightly better. We're seeing probably a little more impact on our digital networks than we are on the fully distributed, and I think that gets to some of the migration as these consolidations happen and other thing as they look at different bundles. But I think when we look at it, in as much like we've talked about that our fully distributed networks continue to retain carriage depending on what bundle they select, and then the digital ones are more of a second tier. So I think you're probably as familiar as we are as to what's going on with the tiering that Vasily mentioned. And that is having some impact when you look beneath the surface. But overall, I would say we might be faring a little better at our bigger networks than some of the others.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Yeah, thanks.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities. Go ahead, please.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Two questions. First and maybe this is a follow-up just to make sure I understand, but when you talk about the new distribution agreements that give you the potential for that mid- to high-digit pricing CAGRs, does that include any additional flexibility in those new agreements, whether it's flexibility on tiering or out of home rights or video on demand? Is there anything new embedded in those agreements relative to what you had before?","My second question's for Ken. Clearly we're seeing some financial impact on you and your peer network groups from this consolidation on the distributor side. Does that impact how you think about the potential for consolidation on the network side in order to maintain or grow your negotiating leverage? Thanks.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, to your first question, we really don't get into the details of packaging and what goes on there. I would just say that we're well positioned as we look at what we've been able to secure. Again, our theme being that the fully distributed networks, we like to get those on the most widely distributed network and the others we look at how those drive probably another tier. And of course, when Henry and his team can, we like to get that on the fully distributed package. But we are pretty realistic about focusing on those big three, getting them in the best position as possible. But we don't get into the specific details.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Michael, second part of your question, and you've heard me say this before, it's our preference to have quality over quantity. I like the position we have with our six networks. I like the family friendly. I like the ratings we deliver. I like the audience we deliver. So when we're sitting across the table from our distribution partners, we have a very strong hand. To increase that hand with more networks that might not be as strong does not necessarily give you a stronger position at the distribution table and in negotiations.","And thus far, I mean if you look at our 20-year history considering where we started, Food was 10 years free if you will. We've fully climbed our way up, I think, to where we're getting to the point where we're getting a little closer to the value that we think we give to our distribution partners. So I think of all of the cable groups, we still come to the table with one of the stronger hands. So consolidation on the content side is not something we spend a lot of time on thinking about.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Laura Martin with Needham. Go ahead, please.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Hey. So I was noticing in your prepared remarks that you said that millennials were up 6% at one of the networks, and then you gave a lot of stats on social metrics and I'm curious as to whether you think those two things are linked? And what do you think the social is bringing to you because I don't think that you're getting a lot of money from the social experimentation you're doing. So do you think what it's doing is driving \u2013 I'm interested in the economic impact of all those social metrics you gave us. So do you think it's driving millennial growth? Is that the economic upside from that, do you think?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Well hi, Laura. This is Burton. Thanks for asking that question because we do think about that a lot. The quick answer is yes, we do think there's a connection. That's part of the reason that we, as I said, recently brought our linear and content teams together under the leadership of Kathleen Finch so that we can think about the environment holistically. And you're correct in saying that we're not \u2013 while we saw very nice digital revenue growth in the U.S. of that 20% this past quarter from a year ago, you're right that some of what's going on in social isn't being monetized to the extent that we think it can. But what it is doing is creating a greater connection with our audience, particularly the younger audience.","And we do believe, and we do research in this so we have some degree of evidence, that we are driving younger viewers in particular to be more connected to our television programming as well. In addition, just the kinds of shows that are being put on in particular outside of HGTV, Flip or Flop and Brother vs. Brother, certain kinds of programming attracts the millennial audience better than others. And so we tend to focus on that for some of our social convergent content as well. But you're right. It's a holistic approach, that's why we restructured ourselves in terms of our organization this past year to take advantage of that. And we'll forge ahead to make more connections across more platforms in every way we possibly can and then monetize them in every way we can.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Very helpful. And then my follow-up will be on the upfront. You guys had a record upfront. A lot of your other incumbents had a lot \u2013 I'm wondering where you guys think that money is coming from? Like is it just that the economy's coming back so this is new money that brands are spending, or is money coming back from digital? There's about $1 billion that got added to this year's upfront compared to prior years, and I'm just curious as to where you guys think that $1 billion is coming from into the upfront market for television? Thanks.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, well, I'll try to start on that and then others can chime in. From what our ad fills team is telling us, it's a number of the things you cited. First of all, our networks are performing very well in an environment where that's not always the case. And so the quality of our audience combined with our actual performance is bringing a lot of advertisers to the table for us just because of the basic facts of how we're doing. So that's a good thing. You did cite digital. I think it would be fair to say that there is some sense that some of the issues related to digital in terms of real audience versus bots, viewability, all of those things have brought some money back to television where there's a long track record of proof of performance in terms of driving sales.","Our networks tend to do even better at driving sales than other networks so I think we're benefiting from that as well. And so I think you're just seeing some degree of a safe harbor when it comes to our family of networks, whether it's other television networks or the digital space. And that's paying off nicely for us in this upfront.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Laura, it's Ken. Just one comment. I think it's somewhat ironic that we're talking as we always do on these quarterly calls about linear television and where the industry is trending. At the end of the day here we sit with record ratings in all of our six networks, impression growth, a record breaking upfront, and the reason is TV advertising still works. Our advertisers have never had more data in research at their disposal. And guess what, they're putting more money back into television. It says something because that's where the rubber meets the road. So that's important us. That's the metric we look. That's our north star. And it continues to drive our company as it has for years, and I think it's positioned us incredibly well for the future ahead.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from John Janedis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. One for Ken and one for Lori. Ken, you talked a little bit about this but as you know, there's been some discussion around skinny bundles and to what extent you'll be participating. And I know you're in a lot of discussions but can you talk about your confidence level in terms of having your key networks as part of any new offerings? And then separately, Lori, can you remind us what percent of your subs renew in 2017? I think there's a fair amount coming up over the next year or so. Thanks.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, John, for your question. Look, I'll just keep it at a high level because as you know we don't get into discussions about negotiations. But as far as level of confidence, incredibly high. As you know, and we've said repeatedly, there's really not \"a skinny bundle\" that we're not included in. And last week was another example with DISH's latest announcement. We're must-have networks, especially if you plan on delivering an upscale women audience. I don't know how you start with any business plan and say we're not going to.","The fact \u2013 we've talked about this on the calls many times. It's a two-edged sword, our distribution economics are where they are. We're an easy group of networks to be included in skinny bundles for all the obvious reasons. So my confidence couldn't be higher as we continue to have discussions, which we mentioned in our comments, even in the MVPD world. If anything, I'm probably more confident than I've ever been about the position of our networks. In going forward, I do think \u2013 as Lori alluded to, I think some of the smaller networks across the industry are going to be under a little bit more pressure.","But the good news for us is both DIY and Cooking are actually extensions of our big brands and bring some very important advertising slots to our distribution partners as well. So I think generally, we're going to do very well, and there'll probably be pressure across the industry on the smaller digital networks that we'll just have to weather.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And John, on your other question about what percentage of our subscriber base is up for renewal. Again, we're come to the conclusion of, I think, the latest round of negotiations. But there's right around 20%, probably, in 2017. That's probably a good proxy.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks a lot. Maybe one quickie for Burton if I could squeeze it in. Appreciated the comment around annual programming. Will original hours be down for the quarter on the Olympics?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Well, as Ken said, no. We're just continuing on our strategy \u2013 so it's a year-long strategy. I think what's being called aggressive programming during the Olympics really just means you're not going into heavy reruns. We're never in heavy reruns. We have 2,500 hours of original content across all of our networks and we spread it out throughout the year. So basically it's steady as she goes.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Oh, hi. Thanks. I'll just keep it to one, I suspect, probably for Lori or anybody else who wants to comment. I wanted to look back at domestic advertising if I could and just see if you could help us as outsiders and what we can learn from progression from Q1 to Q2. I think it's interesting to look, if you look back at your Q1, I think scatter pricing was healthy but low double-digits is what you've cited. And in Q2, you just cited mid- to high-teens scatter over scatter. So pricing actually better in Q2 than it was in Q1.","Per our numbers, it looked like your audiences were up about the same amount in both Q1 and Q2 year-over-year, low-single digit number. And yet your domestic ad revenue was higher in Q1, like 14% growth versus 9% growth in Q2. So just something else must be going on if you had higher pricing, the same audiences but lower revenue growth. What are we missing? Is it mix? Is it something just about the mix Q2 versus Q1? Something about sellout percentage? Any help you could give us would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, Todd, I think you answered your own question. I think it's predominantly related to two things. It's mix, which always has an impact, the scatter's only a part of what we sell but it's doing very well. So you'd have to go back a year ago and remember what we did in the upfront market, so you have to factor that in. And also, this year we've been talking about even though it continues to perform really well, last year we saw sequential improvement. So each quarter the comps got tougher and tougher. So back half being especially stronger. So I think it's really just a function of mix and the pricing that you get in the different markets.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Todd.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much. A couple questions. Quickest one \u2013 Burton, can you give us a sense of your sellouts this year, and can you remind us what your sellouts were in last year's upfront?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Generally, we're about the same from year to year, and that's been true for a number of years. So about the same amount of inventory this year. And of course, Lori gave you the figures of the kinds of increases we got.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","And I'm sorry, in case I missed it in Lori's comments, are you willing to give us sort of the percentage sellout level you're generally around? Is it around 50%?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, I don't have the specific numbers in front of me, but we're generally right around that 50% on the portfolio mark.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","And then...","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So that's (43:44)","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then I'm trying to think of a way to sort of be constructive on the distribution renewal because you've already commented on it a few times. And then one thing I just wanted to sort of approach was sort of AMC, Fox, you and Viacom sort of had the biggest sort of negative adjustment over the last couple quarters in terms of affiliate growth year-over-year. But you were a bit worse than those other three. And I'm trying to understand, did you do something innovative or different with your renewal relative to some of the industry consolidation that we had that would make your growth rate a little bit different over the last couple of quarters than peers?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I really can't comment on what we would've done differently. All I can speak to is that the consolidation's going have an impact. We can look at our renewal cycles and all of those factors have an impact on timing, and then us making the best estimates we can based on how those negotiations will play out. But I can't speak to how we relate to others. It's really \u2013 we've called out since \u2013 we provided guidance in the fourth quarter earnings call that we expected rate equalization have an impact. It's just having a little bit bigger of an impact just based on timing in the second quarter but our full year guidance remains intact. I almost have to keep pointing back to the full year because there might be some choppiness from quarter to quarter, but it was really a matter of how we thought the year was going to end, which is pretty much in line with our expectations as we go through that.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","And I appreciate that, Lori, and that's understood. And specifically where I'm trying to go as we just think about modeling 2017 and beyond, was there anything different than normal that you did with this particular contract? Would you say this is a relatively standard contract versus your other distribution contracts?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, while we don't necessarily get into the details, I don't think there's anything unusual that we would comment that would make an impact that we would need to factor into the modeling at this time. I think what's the most important thing is the point that I made was that the pricing that we're getting out of these contracts looking forward are quite good. Back to those mid- to high-single digit CAGRs. So I think that's the most important fact.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","That's helpful. Then the last of my multiple follow-ups here, just curious, balance sheet flexibility and how you guys are thinking about capital deployment. I look at your gross leverage at about I think three times, correct me if I'm wrong. And you've got a couple hundred million dollars of cash and $1.15 billion of availability on your revolver including the options. So you have a lot of cash capacity, $1.35 billion. How are you thinking about capital deployment and the appropriate level of leverage for the company? And that's it for me. Thanks.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think the story is unchanged. We continue, and we've been doing this all year, to invest organically, which is things like the Lifestyle Studios, that's usually through \u2013 and even programming for our income statement. So we continue to do that on an ongoing basis and that's usually factored into our margins for the most part. We are focused on bringing our leverage down because we like investment grade ratings and we also like the flexibility to be in a position if something opportunistic comes along on the M&A front, specifically in both the U.S. \u2013 maybe more so digital front, but the U.S. markets as well as in the international front.","So I think I would say we like the flexibility. We'll continue to delever. We'll be in a much better position as we round out of 2016 and go into 2017. But really, we're just trying to make sure that we maintain flexibility and investment grade ratings and continue to grow the company. And we like to put dollars to work where we can grow the company. But we'll re-evaluate that as our leverage comes down, but right now \u2013 and again, you saw in the first quarter we did do some M&A transactions with the Travel Channel, buying that in because that made sense, as well. So we continue to look at that.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","All right, thank you very much.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Doug. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we now have a question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.","Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. It's actually Ryan Fiftal from Morgan Stanley, but thanks. And I have two quick ones. So Lori, yet another follow-up on the affiliate revs, but I think you were comping some SVOD revs last year. So did that have any impact on the rate of growth this quarter?","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It did not.","Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then you mentioned that your digital networks are seeing a little more volume pressure compared to the big three networks. So I guess given the trends you're seeing now and your outlook for skinny bundles, does that at all impact how you think about the concentration of your programming investments in the big three networks versus the smaller ones? Thanks.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I'll probably just let Burton handle that. I don't know if it necessarily changes it long term because I think we've been pretty efficient and thoughtful about how we manage the portfolio of brands. But I think Burton's probably better situated to answer that.","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I would say my quick answer is we're seeing very nice ratings and impressions growth at all three of our digital-tiered networks. I think I said Great American Country, of course, coming off a relatively small base, is up 50%. And that's really not spending a whole lot of money on programming. And the reason for that is the audience is relatively small compared to our other two digital tiers. But we do invest in a pretty good amount of original programming. So it's all based on the reach of those audiences, our ability to turn those programming investments into actual monetization through our advertising. We do that incredibly well with DIY Network and Cooking Channel. And we're happy to see growth beginning at GAC. So it's really more about the kinds of impressions we can drive and not necessarily thinking about where we are on the tier and what impact that has on distribution.","Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Go ahead, please.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, thank you. I wanted to come back to the upfront market again. Mentioned no increased inventory sell and you said that you've done that for many years. I wonder if there's a strategic reason why you would do that or why you would not be raising your inventory sell-through in such a strong market as this. I guess the extension of the question is, are you that confident in the scatter market? And then also relatedly, you've talked many times about live viewership of your program being about 93% of the total. Is it possible to break down the linear versus the digital revenues on advertising?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","This is Burton. I'll try to tackle both of those, Tim. Quick answer on the latter question is no. We're really not going to break that down. Although I will observe that right now the viewing through TV Everywhere essentially is growing at a very nice pace, but it's still a very, very small percentage of the overall viewership. So even if we were to disclose those numbers, at this point they'd be relatively small. But we expect that there will be growth there and that's why we've been such big supporters of the TV Everywhere initiative.","In terms of the upfront, I guess the quick answer would be yes. We have confidence, but it's a confidence not just in the scatter market but in our own ability to drive impressions, to continue to have the best possible environment for advertisers, to attract that highly desirable audience. Basically, our ad sales team is a great partner to our programming and marketing teams. And collectively, we just believe in our strength and don't feel the need to expand the inventory that we sold in the upfront this year. And that's, as I said, been very consistent over a number of years because the performance of our networks has been so consistent.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Go ahead, please.","Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. First question just on programming expense. I was wondering if you could touch on what the growth of programming or overall expense would've been. I think maybe excluding some one-time step-up you've had in amortization. And then also you mentioned some of the marketing spend gets pushed out a little bit. So is there any shift in the programming strategy here quarter to quarter, and what would we expect programming spend growth to look like maybe for the back half of the year? Again, also without some of the one-time step-ups.","Lori A. Hickok - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I'll talk about holistically, because I don't necessarily have the quarter to quarter. What I can tell you is that our programming spend and what you see in the amortization is probably the highest in the second quarter. So on the programming-only front, if I could see the largest impact this year \u2013 but again, we've been talking about our overall investment on the portfolio, how that's moderated. It's a little bit of a leading indicator of what you'll see on the amortization, but again the programming teams have to make the right scheduling decisions, which does have an impact. And yes, we did have an impact from changing our amort. So I think you're going to see that continue to moderate, and there'll be huge moderation when we look at the fourth quarter.","In fact, with the marketing spend and programming, I think we've highlighted that we think Q3 is going to be where we continue to invest and you're going to see a little bit of margin push there on the U.S. side, but you're going to see expansion probably on the back half related to that shifting in spending. But again, it's back to the hours. We're putting the right amount of hours. The team keeps doing it and you factor that. So I really just think you're seeing the impact of just the stewardship of Kathleen and her team managing that 2,500 hours on the U.S. side the best way they can and maximizing that with impressions growth.","And again, we've moderated on our Travel Channel hours but I would \u2013 I think I've been pretty consistent saying if Kathleen and her team start to see traction and we're driving the revenue and Steve's out there selling it, you could see those hours start to be increased. But again, too early to call that. I think we're quite comfortable. But I think you're looking at, when you look at our cost of sales, at least on the programming side, probably the largest quarter of the year was \u2013 as far as an impact, was in the second quarter. Doesn't mean we're not still spending as we continue and seeing that amortization in the back half.","Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then maybe just a follow-up on advertising and a longer term question about virtual MVPDs. So as you've come through this upfront season and you talk about the way that impressions are monetized in a virtual world, I know you sell into something like 30 different demographics, many of those of course are going to be younger and sort of higher value. So are advertisers ready to start talking about how they're going to price an impression in a virtual versus a linear bundle? Do they look at it all differently? And how do you think about that transition of your advertising monetization?","Burton Jablin - Chief Operating Officer","Well, I'll try to tackle that one, too. I think it's an evolution right now. Obviously, we do sell digitally. We sell digital impressions. I said we had 20% growth in our advertising revenue on the digital side for the U.S. And so there is a different pricing equation when it comes to our digital impressions, whether it's for flat content or video content. If you're talking about essentially the linear feed through TV Everywhere or through a digital delivery platform, Roku, all those things, Apple TV, Amazon Fire, or our own apps or our distributors' apps. If it's the linear feed, that pricing would be the same as the television network. If it's dynamic ad insertion post day three, which we're seeing some growth in, that's priced as a digital buy and so would have a different pricing component.","So I guess the quick answer is that, yes, there is a different equation when it comes to a pure digital buy, but because this is all evolving and what we hope will be more viewing of our linear networks through digital platforms, that would be rolled up into the standard television buy within C3. So it's a little bit complicated right now, but I hope that helps give you some idea of how we're looking at it.","Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Joyce with Evercore ISI. Go ahead, please.","David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. Appreciate a little of the color on TVN in terms of the stronger quarters and lighter quarters on margin. Just wondering if you're starting to invest in the potential buildouts for the region, if that was part of the vision of that acquisition. Thank you.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, David. It's Ken. Because we have Jim Samples on the line actually from Warsaw as you heard in Dylan's setup, we'll turn that question to Jim Samples.","Jim Samples - President, International","Sure. So a couple of questions there, I think. In terms of the differences in the quarter, that's primarily related just to the cycles here of when there's more money in the marketplace. So it's mostly revenue driven rather than cost driven. And the growth that we've been seeing is both good demand and advertising, which is kind of following the economic growth around sort of mid-single digits. As well as strong ratings increases from expanding our primetime premieres into summer, that's given us nice momentum. In terms of expanding into the region, there's nothing imminent, but certainly being here and being in the largest economy in this part of the world gives us a bird's eye view of some of the opportunities that are out there. But certainly, immediately our focus will be on continuing to grow TVN here in Poland.","David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC","All right, thank you.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you and our final question will come from Ben Mogil with Stifel. Go ahead, please.","Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of Europe's sort of post-Brexit and both I guess between UKTV and sort of anything else you've got \u2013 all the other channels you've got in Europe. Anything you're seeing in terms of the advertisers' sentiment changing?","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll turn back to Jim, Ben, because he's there. He's spent a lot of time obviously in Europe. But the short answer is no. I mean, as Lori said, UKTV just delivered the strongest results, I think, in history. So we're not really seeing an impact post-Brexit. But, Jim, you might to expand on that as it relates to what you're seeing there in Poland and across Europe and internationally.","Jim Samples - President, International","No, we're not seeing much impact of it here. In the UK, there's some talk about potentially softening in advertising revenues but we've not seen evidence of that happening yet. And we've also just had particularly strong ratings so to the extent there's any small reduction on the revenue side from demand, I think we'll make up for that in the ratings. But remember also that the UKTV numbers are not consolidated here, but are reflected in equity earnings. So that's if there were any change at all, that's where we would see that. But overall, again, the biggest revenue opportunity for us continues to be growth in the Polish market, which continues to be very strong and has not shown any drawback after Brexit.","Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's great. Thank you very much.","Dylan Jones - Chief Communications Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, everyone, for listening in today.

Good morning, everyone. Always happy you're able to be with us today. The momentum we saw in 2016 has continued into 2017, as we further implement our strategy of strengthening our core businesses, building our reach, and most importantly, monetizing our audiences.","In the first quarter of this year, total operating revenue grew 5%, adjusted segment profit increased 6%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 19%, to $1.53. Our unwavering focus on building deep and enduring connections with upscale consumers everywhere through compelling lifestyle content in the home, food, and travel categories, and our ability to monetize that relationship with advertisers and distributors, is really what drives our consistent performance.","Our proven strategy for creating compelling programming focusing on ideas, information, and inspiration, has uniquely positioned Scripps Networks Interactive in the minds of viewers, advertisers, and platforms alike. 23 years ago, we created a cable network company. Now in 2017, we are a comprehensive lifestyle content business that relentlessly pursues deeper engagement with consumers everywhere, regardless of device or geography. Our lifestyle-leading brands are at the heart of Scripps Networks Interactive. And I'm happy to say that we continue to deliver great performance in our core businesses, our networks continue to resonate with consumers now more than ever.","We have seen consistent strength in ratings and we're continuing to strengthen our core business through investment in programming and we can see that pay off in our results. But as I've said, we're now more than just a television company. Three announcements that we made just this week underpin our strategic focus on expanding our reach through new platforms and technologies.","For example, yesterday Hulu announced that our networks will be included on their virtual MVPD product offering. Now, since our network group is not among Hulu's investors, that is one clear illustration of the value distribution partners place on the audience that we deliver and the value that we offer to businesses seeking to establish themselves with a mainstream audience.","The addition of Hulu means that our networks will be available on almost every one of the virtual MVPD skinny bundle offers announced so far. We're also excited to partner with each of these companies, as we bring our highly sought-after brands to new audiences through these streaming platforms.","Yesterday we also announced that we acquired next generation food media company Spoon University. Spoon U is a company created by Millennials for Millennials and we expect this acquisition to help us build our content, community, and brand as we accelerate our digital strategy and reach with younger audiences.","And just this morning, we announced that we've expanded our relationship with Snapchat, enabling us to create original short-form show concepts specifically for that platform. Food Network's launch on Snapchat's Discover platform in January 2015 was fundamental to our development as a digital content company, helping us to become much more agile.","Our digital content division Scripps Lifestyle Studios has become the one-stop shop for all digital content leading the way for digital and video integration. We've demonstrated incredible video and social growth over the last year as well. The Lifestyle Studios generated nearly 2.9 billion video views, that's an increase of about 450% over the first quarter of 2016, really a remarkable achievement and just one example of our determination to expand our reach across all devices.","Regardless of whether consumers are watching The Property Brothers on television on HGTV or seeing Andrew Zimmern on Facebook, or peeking behind the scenes of Iron Chef Gauntlet on their mobile phone, we're always looking to make sure we deliver a consistent and rewarding experience.","We've created a highly differentiated environment within the current media landscape. Our networks provide an optimistic environment, where consumers are open to receiving advertising messages and, importantly, act on those messages. This translates to strong financial results, with our network group consistently delivering advertising growth. To use a theme from our recent very successful up-front presentations, Environment Matters.","The environment we cultivate for our distributors, combined with the growing strength of our brands, satisfies the viewing desires of their customers and creates value for the distribution's business model. For those reasons, our networks have become essential to the leading multichannel providers, as well as reaching agreements with virtual MVD players such as Hulu, we continue to make significant progress and deals with more traditional platforms. For example, over the last several months, we've executed long-term renewals with a number of our distribution partners and have now renegotiated nearly 80% of our subscriber base for the next several years. We're not just focused on creating engaging viewing environments in the United States, but also throughout the world. TVN continues to deliver solid growth across its portfolio, increasing revenue, audience levels, and market share. HGTV in Poland continues to outperform even our own high expectations and provides a platform to debut in more European markets over the coming years.","We actively engaged in partnership discussions with some of the biggest media groups in key markets about launching networks or branded blocks of content, our success in countries such as Poland really reinforces our value to those potential partners. With important launches of our networks also coming up in markets including Germany and Italy, we're clearly demonstrating our commitment to expanding our geographic reach.","Let me close by restating that, over 20 years ago, we started to create and own lifestyle programming focusing on ideas, information, and inspiration, or as Burton Jablin said when he coined it, the three I's. It's created a unique viewing environment. We set out to ensure this content was available wherever and whenever viewers wanted to consume it, that philosophy continues to pay off, on linear television, on digital platforms, and internationally. It's a strategy that has served us very well. We continue to optimize our business across all areas, as we focus on enhancing shareholder value for the long term. Today's results are another demonstration of that commitment.","Now let me turn it over to Burton, who will review some of our first quarter operating results. Burton?","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Scripps Networks Interactive continues to perform at a high level, benefiting from our continued investment and focus on delivering engaging content across all brands. Following up on the theme that Ken spoke about, our approach to delivering a differentiated and engaging environment was highlighted in a recent study conducted by Nielsen. The results of the study indicated advertising messages were viewed 22% more favorably in our lifestyle environment than for general entertainment, reality, sports, or news. Nielsen also determined that viewers were, on average, 94% more engaged with a commercial viewed on our lifestyle, in our lifestyle environment than in the other genres. Compared with sports programming, lifestyle performed 150% better, and against news programming, 172%.","Those results demonstrate that environment really matters. The engaging environment we create, coupled with the popularity of our must-have lifestyle brands, continues to pay off in our quarterly results. In the first quarter of 2017, amid an evolving landscape, 5 of our 6 U.S. Networks posted year-over-year gains for adults 25 to 54 in sales prime ratings. In addition, 5 of our 6 networks grew or were in line for key total day ratings. When it comes to home, viewers look to us for how to buy it, build it, share it, and love it.","At HGTV, the network delivered its second highest rated quarter ever. HGTV was ranked as the number one network for women in both sales prime and weekend time periods, with solid delivery from hit series Fixer Upper, Flip or Flop, and Property Brothers helping to drive the quarter.","Our programming teams have a knack for building on what works. And so we franchised our successful shows Flip or Flop to include several new couples in new cities. Flip or Flop Vegas premiered April 7 to strong viewership and ratings and has continued to deliver ratings success each week since. Our creative teams also have another new hit on their hands with Hometown, which premiered in the first quarter as the second highest rated show on HGTV for adults 25 to 54 sales prime, behind only our hit Fixer Upper.","In April, the positive momentum from these premieres helped position HGTV as the number one cable network for women 25 to 54 and the number 6 network for adults 25 to 54. HGTV also finished April as the number one cable network in weekends. The demand for food content continues to grow, and for Food Network, our programming has never been more relevant to the lives of consumers. In the first quarter of 2017, Food Network's ratings were even with 2016 for adults 25 to 54, while improving 4% among both women 25 to 54, and women 18 to 49. Leading shows in the quarter were Worst Cooks in America, and Kids Baking Championship.","Returning to Food Network for the first time in more than three years is the icon of cooking shows, Iron Chef. In its premiere episode on April 16, Iron Chef Gauntlet was the highest rated Scripps Network show that week and follow-up episodes continued to generate high marks for the network.","Travel Channel finished the quarter with adult 25 to 54 ratings up 9% for sales prime, making it the highest rated quarter since the first quarter of 2014. Travel Channel continues to build momentum off a successful programming slate which includes premieres of Expedition Unknown, Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, Mysteries at the Museum, and Bizarre Foods: Delicious Destinations.","DIY Network continues to deliver ratings growth across its key demos with ratings up 4% for adults 25 to 54. Key shows included Texas Flip and Move, Building Alaska, and Holmes and Holmes.","At Cooking Channel, the network again delivered its highest rated quarter ever for adult sales prime, improving 18% year-over-year. Driving the growth were original series, Carnival Eats, Dinner at Tiffani's, and Food: Fact or Fiction?.","Great American Country is a great complement to the Scripps Lifestyle portfolio with content that powers our audience's passion for outdoor pursuits. In the first quarter of 2017, the network posted its highest ratings since 2007, marking five consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year growth.","Our strategy to deliver consistent engaging and quality content seven nights a week continues to pay-off. With premieres every night of the week, viewers will always have a reason to return to our networks. Scripps Lifestyle Studios continues to lead engagement and broaden our reach on dozens of digital and mobile platforms. In the first quarter of 2017, Scripps Lifestyle Studios averaged more than 430 million monthly unique visitors across multiple platforms. The team produced more than 1,000 videos in the first quarter of this year. As Ken mentioned, video views in the quarter were up to almost 3 billion and we continue to see significant growth, as we move into the second quarter.","We continue to look for new ways to engage younger audiences. The agreement we announced today with Snapchat will enable us to bring original short form food and home related shows to the platform. This partnership allows us to further bridge our television brands to digital and create unique content tailored for the next generation of food and home enthusiasts.","Our TV Everywhere apps are showing significant growth in both video plays as well as user visits. Video plays in the first quarter increased more than 360% and average monthly visits improved 42% compared to 2016. The base is small but we're pleased with the momentum TV Everywhere is showing. In April, after generating more than 1 billion views, Food Network ranked number one among Tubular Labs food and drink category, topping Tastemade, Delish, and BuzzFeed's Tasty.","Our all star promotions team came together to create the ultimate seaside getaway for the 2017 HGTV Dream Home Giveaway. The annual sweepstakes received an all time high of 131 million entries in the first quarter.","Internationally, our brands continued to deliver. The first quarter was another strong quarter for TVN, with ratings for the group improving nearly 6% with its key 16 to 49 year-old audience, compared to the first quarter of 2016. TVN, the main network, achieved a market share of nearly 13%, making it the most watched television station in Poland for persons 16 to 49.","TVN 24 was the most watched 24 hour news channel in Poland and TVN Style was the number one lifestyle channel during the quarter. HGTV in Poland continues to build momentum, as more and more audiences tune into its lifestyle programming. After launching earlier this year, HGTV is the number two lifestyle network in the country among women 16 to 49, second only to TVN Style.","For its just completed fiscal year, UKTV delivered record financial results, growing revenue 8% and EBITDA 11%, both in local currency. The multichannel broadcaster also grew its share of viewing 10% over the prior year.","We remain focused on growing our footprint in new markets. Most recently, we announced that Food Network will launch in Italy on May 8. This will be the first dedicated multiplatform food entertainment channel in the country, and will offer a mix of local original productions and our flagship shows. This launch in a key growth market for our company represents a significant milestone in our ongoing global expansion.","Quarter after quarter, Scripps Networks Interactive delivers consistent and improving operating results. We're pleased with our performance to-date in 2017, and I'll now turn the call over to Lori, who will review in detail our financial performance for the first quarter of 2017.","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Thanks, Burton. And good morning, everyone. I'll focus my comments today on the quarterly consolidated numbers and discuss our operating segment performance. Consolidated revenues in the first quarter increased 5% to $855 million, compared with the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, distribution revenue growth, and growth in our international businesses. As a result of our revenue growth, coupled with a modest increase in expenses due to timing, consolidated adjusted segment profit improved 6%.","The growth in adjusted segment profit coupled with lower depreciation, amortization and interest expense, as well as increase in foreign exchange transaction gains increased our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.53, compared with $1.29 in the prior year quarter.","Looking at our operating segments, our U.S. Networks' revenue increased 5%. This improvement was driven by growth in advertising demand for our lifestyle networks and the expected increase in distribution revenue. U.S. advertising revenue increased 5% year-over-year in the first quarter, due to CPM pricing increases, partially offset by an overall decrease in impressions, and a pricing mix shift away from higher price scatter inventory compared with the first quarter of 2016.","Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter, with CPMs up mid-to-high teens year-over-year and up high teens to mid-20% over the broadcast upfront. Our top five advertising categories during the quarter were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, financial, and pharma. These categories are consistent with the historical performance for the first quarter, except for pharma, which improved over 2016.","The healthy demand for scatter has continued into the second quarter of 2017, although quarter-over-quarter CPM pricing increases have tempered somewhat in the first month of the quarter, especially compared with the strong CPM increases realized in the second quarter of last year. Presently against top comps scatter-over-scatter CPM growth is running in the low single to low double-digit range and scatter over upfront CPM growth is running in the mid-to-high teens range. Additionally, we are presently seeing an unprecedented strong second wave of scatter demand in the quarter, during a period when scatter inventory and demand is normally slower.","This wave of demand would and should drive CPM pricing higher than what we're currently experiencing for the second quarter. Also included in our overall advertising revenue is our growing digital advertising business, which improved a healthy 12% over the first quarter of last year. This growth was partially offset by revenue decreases related to the strategic decision to discontinue our Netflix relationship and refocus our digital assets from uLive.com to other more economically attractive digital efforts.","Including these impacts, our overall digital revenue increased 4% compared with the prior year first quarter. Distribution revenue for the U.S. Networks' increased 4.5%, contributing to this anticipated increase was negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top virtual MVPD platforms. These increases were partially offset by industry subscriber declines. As a result of the increase in revenue, coupled with a modest increase in spending due to timing, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. Networks' increased 6% compared with the prior year quarter.","Looking ahead, we expect spending to increase in the second and third quarters, increasing in the mid-teens compared with the prior year for both quarters. Driving this growth will be increases in programming related to our premiere schedule coupled with higher SG&A spending related to the various strategic growth initiatives we spoke about during our February earnings call.","For the International segment, the majority of the revenues are generated by TVN. In local currency TVN revenue increased 4% compared with the same time a year ago. On a reported basis, International Networks' revenues increased 3.5% to $125.5 million. Driven by the revenue growth and relatively flat expenses, International adjusted segment profit increased to $15.5 million, compared with $10 million in the first quarter of 2016.","In addition to our consolidated international business, a significant portion of our international business is reported in equity income. These investments include UKTV and our partnership with Corus in Canada for Food Network, Cooking Channel, HGTV, and DIY Network, along with some TVN minority investments. In total, equity and earnings of affiliates was $20 million, down from $26 million in the prior year quarter. Driving the year-over-year decrease was the sale of Fox Sports South in the first quarter of 2016 and decreased contribution from a TVN minority investment. These declines were partially offset by a double-digit percentage growth at UKTV. Additionally, subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2017, we announced the sale of a minority investment in Onet, a non-strategic asset for $54 million. This minority asset was not a material contributor to equity and earnings of affiliates.","On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the first quarter approximately 2.3 times growth leverage, down from 2.6 times at the end of the fourth quarter, due to our strong free cash flow generation. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent and we plan to use capital and operating cash flow to fund organic growth including programming, new capabilities, and multiplatform business models, as well as invest strategically through M&A, both domestically and internationally, and to reduce our leverage.","We will also continue to evaluate the opportunity to repurchase our shares under the existing board authorization, which has $1.5 billion remaining.","Finally, there is no change in our previously issued full year guidance. As I indicated earlier, based on current programming schedules and strategic growth initiative spending, we expect to see increased expenses in the second and third quarters. This will drive overall expense growth in the low to mid double-digit range in each quarter compared with the prior year. Overall, we continue to expect to deliver solid growth in 2017, as we make important investments in high quality content, data, and multi-platform opportunities.","I'll now turn the call back over to Ken.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Okay, thank you, Lori, good job. So, before we take Q&A, just a couple of minutes, I wanted to step back for a moment, offer a couple of observations, if I may. It is very clear that this is an industry that is undergoing significant change, as consumer behavior continues to evolve.","The companies, in my opinion, that will be successful for the long term are those that can optimize their business to take full advantage of the opportunities that technology and behavioral transformation offer us. Fortunately, adapting and changing is something that Scripps Networks Interactive really has at its very core. We've had it since day one. That's why I'm so confident in the long-term vision of this company.","For example, the steps that we've taken just in the last few days are a demonstration of how we've taken a set of cable TV networks and ownership of our content, and created a global lifestyle content business. It's a business that's taking active steps to grow, to respond to demand, and to build the brightest possible future. As we mentioned previously, yesterday Hulu announced that our networks would be on their live TV service from launch, making us the only cable network group not owned by Hulu shareholders to be included. That's a ringing endorsement of our brands and the value that they bring to advertisers and distributors. And just a few hours later, we announced the acquisition of Spoon University, a next generation food media company founded by two Millennials who actually grew up watching Food Network.","I think that's a demonstration of our commitment to really never sit still and always find ways to stay relevant with our audiences. And then this morning, we announced our expanded relationship with Snapchat, with a commitment to create shows on their platform to build on the successful food and home franchises we built on our TV networks. That's an indication of the way we have revolutionized our processes to become a nimble production house that can take advantage of audience and advertising opportunities within hours, not months.","So, around the globe, we're growing, we're developing. Our linear networks are entering new markets and capturing audiences every month. Our social teams are creating more videos and content than ever before. And we've gone from tens of millions of views per quarter to almost 3 billion.","Change is not easy, but at Scripps Networks Interactive we regard it as a necessity. That's why the fundamentals of our business are so strong. It's why we continue to grow and it's why I continue to have such a resounding faith in the long-term success of this business. So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions this morning. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Laura Martin with Needham. Please go ahead.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi there, guys, can you hear me okay?","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Hey, Laura. Yeah, good morning.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Hey, great to \u2013 so, Ken, I'm going to push you on Snapchat. I often ask you about what your experience has been with Snap, and you said today that Food Network has been on there since January of 2015. And I sort of got the sense over the years that the economics sort of weren't there yet. And today we get an announcement that you're expanding the deal. So, if it's not money, why? Other than just there's billion hours and a thousand new pieces of content? I'm really interested in what the strategic offset is if there's no money behind it.","And then Easter shift, was there any, for Lori, was there any impact on the numbers? We are hearing from a couple of your competitors that Easter had an impact on the ratings. Those are my first two. Thanks, guys.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Okay, Laura. Well, it is the old line. It's not about the money, Laura, it's about the amount. But seriously, everything we do and you can call it early stage experimentation or partnerships, you name it, is always with the point of view that this eventually is going to be a profit center for us. In the case of Snapchat, I have to say it's been a great partnership thus far. Just in the last 12 months, we've doubled our audience on Snapchat, by now expanding into the Home category. We actually see this as a partnership that is going to lead to profitability. And we don't really share a lot of the financial arrangements that we have. But I have to say that we've been very impressed with not only what we've been able to do on Snapchat, but some of the anecdotal stuff that's coming from that. And I'll leave it there, although Burton may want to comment a little bit beyond that. Burton?","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Well, I would just add, you asked what's the value sort of beyond the economics. The value \u2013 you have to look at it in the context of other things we're doing. Remember, Food Network itself is targeted at 25 to 54-year-olds, but we all know, and data shows us, that there are a lot of people younger than that interested in food. So in that context, we're expanding our reach to younger audiences through Snapchat, most recently with Spoon U. And this is the process that you'll see us continue, because we want to get younger people who are interested in the food category, when they're young onto one of our services, maybe move them to other of our platforms. So it's part of a broader strategy.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Yeah, and then, Laura, before I let Lori answer the second part of your question, if I could take just a second, I mean, you've covered us for a while. You can remember a time when I was out begging people to give us $100 for a cable network spot, because the value just wasn't there. And if you look at a lot of things that we were doing at E.W. Scripps eons ago with these little cable networks and these little investments, we had these big newspapers and television stations and all this cash flow. It was really about getting bigger by thinking smaller and it's a lesson we've never forgotten. So now with successful cable networks, but very successful brands, how can we partner, how can we, as Burton says, go beyond our core audiences to younger audiences that are not necessarily on linear television? And the real way to do it is to partner with Snapchat, with Facebook, on and on and on. And we think it will pay off in the long term. And I think sometimes we just don't get the credit for some of this expanding beyond the core linear television business, because it doesn't show immediate payoff on the bottom line. But, I'm hopeful, like the little ideas of the cable networks that certainly were beneficial to the growth of the E.W. Scripps Company. Some of these small investments and small partnerships we're making now will benefit SNI over the long term. And then, Lori, you want to take Laura's question about ratings?","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Certainly. I would say on the U.S. side of the house that was not something I heard from our team saying that Easter had any impact on how we delivered. But I will say, on the international side, and TVN specifically, they were expecting Easter to have an impact, which, due to the weather, had less of an impact. And actually, they saw great ratings because people did not go on holiday, which is typically what happens in Warsaw during the Easter break. So, overall Easter did not have a noticeable impact on our results.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Super. Thanks, guys. Such an excellent management team. It's a pleasure. Those are excellent answers. I appreciate them all. Thanks.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","You're very kind, Laura. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much. My first question is just on the previous weakness we had been seeing with HGTV at the beginning of the year, which looks like it's abating and you're seeing much better results now into the June quarter. Is there any sense of how much was sort of a temporary displacement, given maybe high engagement news at the start of the year that might be waning a bit? Or is it the change in your programming? Maybe it's a bit of both? Any color on that would be greatly appreciated.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Great, Alexia, let me kind of take a top line and let Burton dig in. And you're absolutely right. I mean, 2016 was just incredible year, especially first quarter for HGTV. First quarter this year, I mean, not only the amount of live news viewing, but it was a really, really interesting sports quarter, if you will, from the standpoint of the amount of engagement with sports viewing. So the first quarter was a little bit, I don't want to call it an anomaly, but I don't think we've seen that much live viewing in a quarter, unless you come up with something like the Olympics, or some big events.","So, we were fighting some headwinds in first quarter. But, look, you've been in this business long enough when you have incredible quarters. It's a ratings business that goes up and down, and our important thing is consistency, staying on target, on brand. So, Burton, you want to expand on that?","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Well, that's right. And, Alexia, what I hear your question is sort of what's fundamentally going on at HGTV? That's what we examined with our teams. And we believe HGTV remains fundamentally strong. The second quarter was \u2013 sorry, the first quarter rather was the second best quarter in HGTV's history. It's still number one with women 25 to 54, upscale women in particular, upscale audiences. So when we analyze it, we see the specific things that Ken mentioned and then there's one more \u2013 I mean, these are things that affect us. We don't pay a lot of attention to competition, but there was a big hit on NBC this year on Tuesday nights called This Is Us airing against one of our biggest hits, Fixer Upper and we did see an impact there.","Now, once This Is Us went out of premieres, we saw Fixer Upper do just fine. So, again, these were specific things, news viewing, comparison to first quarter last year, not fundamental issues with HGTV at all. And I was just with our team this week talking about all the great new premieres they have coming on in the second quarter and for the rest of the year. I have just complete confidence in HGTV going forward.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that's very helpful. And if I could just ask a clarification of a previous comment, I think, in your opening remarks, I think maybe from Lori, when they talked about the scatter environment in Q2, I think, if I might have heard incorrectly, but was the guide up low single digits to up to low double digits? It seems like a very unusually wide range. I just wanted to see if I heard that correctly and, if so, why such a wide range?","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","You absolutely heard that correct, Alexia, and it is an unusually wide range, but I think, it's just across our networks we're seeing different pricing points. But as I said we're seeing this second strong wave of demand. So I talked with Steve and he's feeling confident that that might tighten and we're going to see pricing pressure upward. But we wanted to be very clear and transparent in our comments.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Yeah, Alexia, I think, I mean, it's firm grasp of the obvious and you obviously picked up on it. I mean, there's some positioning here for the upfront. And this \u2013 I don't want to call it gamesmanship, but there's a little bit more, I think, this time around. So read into that, I think that wide range has something to do with setting up the upfront in some instances, if that makes sense.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Definitely. Thank you so much.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Instanet.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, maybe for Burton or Lori. In the quarter, you talked about experiencing an ad revenue mix shift to direct response from scatter. Just wondering if you could size that, how many points maybe, or what was that worth roughly? And then do you expect that mix shift effect to continue into the second quarter or beyond at all?","And then for Lori, on the distribution side, I think you had previously said that you expect distribution growth to continue to grow throughout the year. So, it sounds to me like some of the softness in industry subs is really not affecting your expectations for distribution growth in the 2Q and beyond. So is it just the case that the rate increases from your renewals are offsetting any softness in subs? And should we broadly continue to expect distribution revenue to accelerate with each successive quarter throughout the year? Thanks.","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Okay. Well, Anthony, I'll take your first question on the mix, and just to clarify, where we saw the shift was more into the upfront. I mean, there was a little more DR, but I would say more of it was scatter going into the upfront, which, as you know, is a lower priced market. And we do see some of that still happening in the second quarter. So we are seeing, I would say, more pacing on the upfront than we are on the scatter. But, again, the scatter is very strong. But that's what we saw and that's what we continue to see in the second quarter.","On the distribution side, we \u2013 like we said in the opening comments, we are being impacted like everyone else with the distribution erosion that's continuing. We're not seeing it escalate. It's been pretty constant with what we saw last year. And yes our pricing increases are helping to abate and offset that. And we do expect to continue to see increases throughout the year. But I wouldn't say \u2013 we're not looking for, like, huge jumps from quarter to quarter. We just think it's going to gain some strength. But like the rest of the industry, we continue to watch the sub numbers. But, again, as Ken and Burton both said in their prepared remarks, we have fortunately gotten onto all of these skinny bundles, and that's going to help, I think, protect us on that as that continues to grow too.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Sure, Anthony.","Operator","Our next question is from John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thank you. A couple of short ones, I think. One is, Ken, going back to your comment around more or less segment for advertising, you've also talked for a long time about your endemics. And, as you know, there's a lot of concern on the retail and CPG categories. So what is the outlook for those two? And how different is the growth you're seeing, do you think, compared to the broader marketplace? I think, you tend to take share maybe in marketplaces like this.","And then, maybe, separately, given the distribution revenue, which I think came in ahead of most people's expectations, were the price increases that you recognized in the more recent deals, maybe I'd call it above trends, if you will? And then, given your distribution on nearly all platforms, what is your appetite for being part of a skinnier bundle, like perhaps an entertainment bundle only, if you will, if the economics were right?","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","All right, John, let's start with your first question relative to advertising categories, endemics, et cetera. I would say you have to separate a little bit a lot of what's going on in retail as far as real estate and stores from advertising budgets, because, quite honestly, if you look at our categories and our endemics, we haven't seen much of a change. I'm looking across the table at Lori to make sure that we're in total agreement. I don't have the information in front of me, but Lori, in the categories in consumer products, et cetera, autos, financial, it's pretty consistent from what we've seen from fourth quarter, first quarter, and even trending beyond that.","Having said that, and, John, I think the fact that we always layer the endemics in. If you go back several years ago, it was a bigger percentage, if you will, of our overall advertising, fortunately. As we've grown it's become smaller. But, I have to say it's really helpful to have that, because when you have the home improvements, when you have the consumer products that are tilted towards the home and food categories, it's part of the reason that we, I think, are as consistent as we are in the advertising market.","But I think the easy answer is there's not a significant change that we're seeing at this point, depending on where retail goes and store closings and all those kinds of things. But if anything, some of that money in a couple of instances we've actually had a scene shift to advertising, where there's maybe more advertising dollars freed up, and less around retail locations.","And I think, in talking to Steve Jelati, that's a trend we expect to see continuing. That's why, John, we're expanding more into the digital areas as well and trying to get a bigger piece of that advertising budget. Lori, you want to take John's second question? I'll come back on the skinny bundle.","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Well, I would say we're not basically \u2013 I think, your question, if I recall, and correct me if it was not, was did we see an outsized rate increase in Q1 versus the rest of the year? I would say that's not true. I would just say, again, we were only trying to make sure that we managed expectations around the timing of when we did renewals last year and the impact on those come into play this year. Meaning that not everything get hit in calendar one. But we did see some strong pricing appreciation on a couple of our brands.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","And, John, back to, if you will, a family \u2013 a skinny bundle within a bundle, or some of the things that have been floated around out there. Our point of view is, and Hulu is a good example, we're just \u2013 we're in about just every one of these skinny bundles, and it's not a business that we necessarily want to go up and start out on our own, because slicing and dicing a $35 bundle down to whatever price point, right now, it doesn't seem to us to be a target we want to shoot for. I would leave all opportunities open in the future, but these partnerships \u2013 it's best for us to monetize with streaming services that are already doing the heavy lifting to get out there.","Having said that, the ability to go directly to consumer, if you will, I think long-term still has a lot of appreciation on our part, and potentially a lot of payoff. So, we're going to keep our options open, but it's just safe to say that's not something that we think is in our imminent future.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","You got it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will go to the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Oh, hi, thanks. Two questions on advertising, one sort of simple and to the point, I guess. Probably for Lori, I guess, I just, I know I'm going to get asked, so I'll ask you: How to help us get confident relative to your revenue guidance for the year, compared to sort of first quarter and especially advertising results and growth rates. I think, you guys are still expecting, I guess, an acceleration of year-over-year growth throughout the year, based on, I think, on your guidance, correct me if I'm wrong, and if so, I guess, give you the chance to help us understand why you'd have that confidence, given what seems to be going on with pricing environment and mix shifts and things like that.","And the second, I'll just put it \u2013 while I've got the floor, the second sort of more strategic question, maybe Burton or Ken, Burton, you talked about the differentiated engaging environment for advertising and how important that was to you. That seems to contrast to me actually directly with what some of your peers are saying when you think about maybe something like this open AP interface, which seems to be sort of disaggregating the sale of audience from the surrounding context and environment. And basically you could argue just commoditizing the audience. And it's an interesting contrast to your point of view with that trend and hear what you think about the compare and contrast there and what's \u2013 and how you think selling your context in that audience insulates you and gives you an advantage, as the industry goes up and down and ratings go up and down. Thank you both.","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Well, Todd, as far as what gives us confidence is I would start with we didn't change our guidance. So that's a resounding that we feel comfortable with what we said. And, again, that's total revenue guidance, I will point out, as far as what you expect from quarter to quarter. And, again, I think it's we continue to look at our brands, the endemics, the demand that we're seeing, and again we're early stage of the upfront process. We still feel that's going to be a good market for us. So again, we just remain confident in our brands and the product that we're putting out there, advertisers demand along with endemics that we talked about helping that kind of leave a nice solid foundation for us. So, I would \u2013 it's a simple answer to a simple question.","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","And on the broader question of strategy, we love these kinds of questions, we do think about them a lot, and I think there is actually room for both. But when you're a company like ours that from the beginning has been in specific categories where we target specific audiences in those categories, upscale educated audiences who have a tendency to do what they view, as we always say, we take advantage of that differentiation. In a world of other kinds of content, that is less differentiated, whether it's scripted content or other kinds of reality programs, where it's not clear what the difference is between one network and another in terms of their focus, that becomes harder, and easier to commoditize, as you put it. And then on the digital side, we see the same bifurcation going on. You have programmatic buying, which we do. We engage in it to make sure we're filling all of our inventory, but the real interesting area for us are what we call high-touch digital advertising deals where we really do work with marketers to create really specific hopefully 360-degree cross-platform buys that capitalize on the specificity of our audience, the targeted nature of our content, and the environment we create.","So both exist in this world, there's no question. And in some places, we play in both worlds, particularly digitally. But we think the differentiation is a real advantage for us, and the more the rest of the market commoditizes, we think we have even more of an advantage by being targeted.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Makes sense. Thank you both.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","You got it, Todd.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Doug Mitchelson with UBS.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Sorry about that. Thanks so much. Question on the Hulu deal, I think (46:57) Henry Ahn and the rest of the team there that worked on that. Was that deal consistent with your other distribution deals? Or were there unique terms that were necessary to get into that service given the ownership structure that you mentioned, Ken? And the press release implied that the smaller nets would be included in Hulu at some point. And I guess that suggests to us that Hulu at some point might offer other tiers of service for customers to upgrade to. Is our read of that accurate? And then I've got one more.","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Well, this is Burton. Basically, as we've seen in other of the new offerings, there are tiers, and we've been very up-front about saying that our fully distributed networks are designed to be on the basic packages, as they are with Hulu and other of the virtual MVPDs and our digital tier networks are designed to be on tiers. So, the economics of this deal anticipates the same thing. And in terms of the economics, we've said all along that the deals we're doing with virtual MVPDs, the over the top services, are at the same level or better than the economics of the deals we do with traditional distributors, and that's still the case.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Yeah, Doug, actually you gave me an opportunity, thank you, for singling out Henry Ahn and his team. If you look at Snapchat, if you look at the Hulu deal, and as you know we're in virtually all of the MVPDs, kudos to Henry and his team. It's very difficult out there right now in the distribution environment, and I think for Henry and his team to continue to put points on the scoreboard just emphasizes both hard work of that group, but the fact of the matter is, our value is recognized by every distribution product that's been rolled out.","And also the fact that Hulu overall in their strategic plan continues to value advertising which is critically important for us in the deals that we do. So it truly was a win-win and we couldn't be more pleased that Hulu decided to include us.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","The other area I wanted to focus on was wondering if the Tribune sale opens an opportunity for you to participate in some way with any of the buyers to go after the minority stake in the Food Network JV. And if not, given your leverage is down to the mid-2s, how should we think about the balance sheet and deployment of capital as we get later into the year? Thanks.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Go ahead, Lori.","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Well, Doug, I would say we have always been interested in bringing in Tribune's stake of Food Network. But, again, it's always about price and timing. So, I would just say we would always be interested if someone approached us and pricing and timing made sense and, as you pointed out, our leverage has come down. So timing is a lot better than it was probably a year ago for us on that front. And, as you said, if not Tribune, what will you do with that capital? And I think I'll come back to what I said in the scripted comments and that is we, of course, look to deploy that capital organically to help grow the business, starting with our programming, looking at these multi-platform opportunities that we've been talking about today, and as well as new capabilities. Again, not the capabilities to go direct to consumer, where a lot of our peers are doing that, but just capabilities that you need to do that. So we're making some investments and we've talked about that.","We continue to be opportunistic on the M&A side, both internationally on the digital front, Spoon U being a good example of that, but on the digital side there's not big huge capital outlays that we see in the foreseeable future. And then we continue to look out there. So, I think we've always said that we will be opportunistic, but we will also be balanced and think about returning capital to shareholders if we don't have better uses for that. So, I think, just based on your question, you can see we've gotten in a much more comfortable leverage position. And I'm sure, as we always do, we will be talking to our board about this in our board meeting. It's a continual conversation, but we do still have $1.5 billion authorization remaining.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Appreciate it, Doug.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Good morning.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask a couple of questions. Lori, could you come back to your comments on the second quarter ad market. I think you said the comps, you called out the tough comps in Q2, but when I look at your numbers last year, it looks like Q1 was the tougher comp, at least from a revenue perspective. So, I thought maybe you could just help us think about the year-over-year comp between Q1 and Q2, as you think about modeling the second quarter ad sales. And then you talked about \u2013 it sort of jumped out to me as an unprecedented, I think you used the word wave of demand. And I know we're not going week-by-week, but maybe you could just give us a little more context around that. Are you suggesting that your scatter guidance or state of the scatter market is conservative?","And then just for the broader team, I thought this launch in Italy is interesting. We've seen some real success from some of your U.S. peers who have gotten into that market. Could you talk a little bit more about how you see that opportunity and sort of the timeline for kind of capturing it and maybe compare what you're doing there to other international launches that you've done, so we can think about the opportunity from a revenue and profitability perspective?","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Sure, Ben, we'll let Lori take the first question and Jim Samples is on the line from Warsaw. We'll let him tackle the question around Italy and some of these potential additional launches. Lori?","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Yeah, let me clarify when I was saying tough comps on Q2, what I was specifically referring to and you'd probably have to go back and look at our comments from last year Q1 and Q2 to understand that. So thanks for asking the question. It really was about the year-over-year scatter pricing increases, we saw an elevation and a widening of the gap. We went from probably low double-digit increases in scatter versus scatter in Q1 of last year till we were almost high teens to 20% year-over-year. So we really saw that scatter pricing take a huge bump in the second quarter. So it wasn't overall. But I was meaning to highlight that the scatter pricing marketplace really got extremely hot in the second quarter of last year.","As far as an unprecedented wave. I was talking with Steve Gigliotti just yesterday. Usually by this time and maybe as you're going into the upfront, you see a lot less activity going on, but he has got charts that show that the demand, they're still knocking on the door, they're still looking to buy scatter, and it's usually moderating by now. So, he's seeing just an opposite trend, which is why we're trying to give some color to why we gave that pretty wide range that somebody asked a question about earlier is that we're seeing that that's probably going to tighten up and we might see some lift and strength to that. So, since we won't talk to you for a few months, we wanted to give you that color.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","And, Jim, are you on the line? And can answer Ben's second question?","James D. Samples - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","I'll be happy to. So, the announcement in Italy is very exciting. This is our second digital terrestrial network in Italy with the launch of Food Network. We had Fine Living in the market already, it's more a home targeted network. The exciting thing about this one in particular is that we were able to secure a low channel position, which is extremely important in that market, with Channel 33. And with both of these flagship networks in place, we'll also be able to do more cross-promotion. There's been a tremendous amount of advertiser interest there. So as we look at each of these markets to answer the second part of your question, we look to see: Is there high pay TV penetration for example? In the case of Italy, the answer is no, it's much more of a broadcast network. Is there an opportunity for us to get in and get some valued real estate in order to bring in the kind of viewership that you need in a broadcast environment? And the case was, yes. So very exciting in Italy.","We also have a strong DTT, digital terrestrial presence here in Poland. And as we grow in these markets, we experienced it in the UK as well, we're able to segment our investment into sort of the traditional pay television environment, digital terrestrial, over-the-top, like with the player here in Poland. And I think the key is just to change that mix according to where that market is, and that's been our strategy.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful, thank you.","James D. Samples - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","One other comment: The underlying thing that makes this such an exciting opportunity is that we own the content, we have a tremendous amount of output coming from the U.S., including the formats. And so we can replicate that success both with locally produced content and the content coming from the U.S.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Good stuff. Thanks, Jim.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Thank you, Ben.","Operator","Our final question today will come from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thank you. I have three. One is probably for Lori, just on math. Going to Doug's question about the buying of the food minority stake, can you give a sense of what are the economic benefits besides the accretion of taking cash and buying it, from acquiring it? Is there a tax savings? Is there, Ken, an admin savings from basically having it all managed under one company? So, is there any other economic benefit that you could quantify for us?","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","I think you've got it. That's why it's more of a financial play. We control the asset. We've already got the strategic benefit, based on the stake that we own. So really it becomes right price. We're looking at the cash flows and that's really what the math is.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","And no tax change in the domicile of it from New York to Tennessee? That's not part of it?","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","No, not based on that, no. You could get into structuring it, if there's tax advantages to how you do a transaction with someone. But I think, just for us buying it and bringing it in, it does not have a tax \u2013 the only tax impact we would have is that you would see our effective tax rate go up. Because right now, our effective tax rate doesn't include the income \u2013 their share of the income that's reported in our EBITDA numbers.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then can I ask you on the affiliate fee growth this quarter, you guys started the deals with Verizon and CenturyLink. Did that benefit this quarter? Or will you see those deals flow through the rest of the year?","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Those will be \u2013 I think they're going to come through the year. They're going to be coming through the year.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","So the first quarter didn't really include those signings in the number you reported, in terms of whatever lift you got wasn't in the first quarter?","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","I'll let Mike get back to you on that. I don't want to misspeak on that.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Okay, and the last one, you called out before the $30 million to $40 million in new initiative spending. Did any of it occur in the first quarter or you said 2Q, 3Q is the bulk of it.","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","That's the bulk, very small amount incurred in the first quarter, but it would be immaterial overall. And just to go back to your first question, just to be clear on the tax benefit, and when I was talking about structuring, just to make sure that you understood what I mean, there could be step-up benefits for us, depending on how a transaction is structured. So I'm sure you're familiar with how those work, but I wanted to be clear, if I was probably a little opaque on structuring and how you buy that could have a step-up benefit for us, which could be part of the economics.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Lori.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Thank you, Michael.","Dylan P. Jones - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Thanks, everyone, for listening in today.

Lowe","All right, Mark. Thank you and good morning to all. As always, we appreciate your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. This is a company that delivers on its promises. We deliver on our promises to media consumers to entertain, inform and inspire. We deliver on our promise to advertisers, to provide powerful marketing platforms that engage their most valued customers at the highest level. We deliver on our promise to distributors to build and sustain iconic lifestyle television brands that just about everybody demands. And we deliver on our promise to create value for our shareholders by staying true to a formula for our success that's proven, time and time again, to be remarkably durable. It's a very consistent message.","Our television networks, our websites and our apps are leaders in their respective content categories because of our determination to stay on brand. Our determination to stay focused on consumer interest in all things home, in all things food and in all things travel. It's what sets Scripps Networks Interactive lifestyle brands apart from the competition and that's why our U.S. Lifestyle Media segment just completed its 18th consecutive year of growth. Let me say that again. 18 consecutive years of unprecedented growth that started with an idea for a single niche cable network. An idea that's evolved into a still growing Lifestyle Media business with more than $2 billion in total annual revenues and, for the first time in our history, more than $1 billion in segment profits. That $1 billion plus in segment profits is a very important milestone for us. We're very proud of it because it points directly to the long-term value we've created for our shareholders. And we're proud of it because we know the growth story does not end there.","HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel are growing media franchises because they are clear leaders in their ability to aggregate quality audiences and influence consumer purchasing decisions in the home, food and travel categories. Likewise, DIY Network and Cooking Channel, our flanker brands in the home and food categories, and Great American Country's evolving Living Country format appeal to passionate and engaged audiences that our advertisers value. So let me share the highlights, by network, of just how we performed during the fourth quarter, plus I'll provide a glimpse of some coming attractions as well.","At Travel Channel. We rolled into our fifth consecutive month of year-over-year audience gains, and February is off to a great start as well. It registered a high single-digit audience increases across all day parts and demos, and I'm happy to report that the good news continued right through the month of January with strong double-digit year-over-year growth in our prime time audience. Clearly, in the investment that we're making and lifestyle quality programming at Travel Channel is getting results. And we're building on the momentum we've created with continuing series like Mysteries at the Museum, and we're finding new fans with some of our recent additions which include Baggage Battles, Dangerous Grounds and Airport 24\/7: Miami.","In 2013, our programming investment to define the network and genre continues. For example, taking another page from our successful playbook and in the spirit of HGTV's Dream Home, we rolled out the trip of a lifetime sweepstakes 2 weeks ago. Now, the winning travelers would jet away on their own fabulous trip of a lifetime worth about $100,000. So stay tuned to the Travel Channel, much more exciting things to come there.","Now, the news is even better at HGTV. For the seventh consecutive year, our original flagship network ranked #1 in attracting upscale women viewers. That's a remarkable track record and explains in large part why HGTV drives growth to the company, year in and year out. Viewership at HGTV grew consistently through the fourth quarter with the audience among all adults and women aged 25 to 54 in the low-to-mid single digits. The momentum, by the way, continued into January with viewership up strong double digits in just about across the board day parts and demos. And helping drive the audience growth are some of our newer shows, including Love It or List It and Buying and Selling. Also, from what we can tell, the popularity of House Hunters and House Hunters International simply knows no bounds.","To keep the momentum going into 2013, we have some strong returning series, including new series of the successful Property Brothers franchise and Income Property. Now, we've already had some exciting premieres during the first quarter, including Hawaii Life which is similar to House Hunters but with a definite tropical twist. And the popular Kitchen Cousins are back for a new show, Cousins on Call, and this time our popular duo is surprising homeowners with dramatic renovations that will make their dreams come true.","Plus in 2013, we'll continue to generate strong viewer and advertiser demand with our quarterly tent pole events, including Dream Home, which is the largest sweepstakes on all of television. We're creating tons of momentum at HGTV and we're off to a great start in 2013.","At Food Network this year, we're celebrating an important anniversary. 20 years of defining a wildly popular television genre and shaping the nation's, and now the world's, conversation about food. The anniversary celebration follows an outstanding 2012. Food Network finished the year ranked ninth among all ad-supported cable networks. It was the most-watched year ever for the network despite the softness we began experiencing in the fourth quarter. Now, that's a testament to just how strong the audience growth was through most of the year. We're already seeing some very positive audience trends around some new seasons of popular series, Restaurant Impossible and Restaurant Stakeout are back driving good numbers and Diners, Drive-ins and Dives is still a fan favorite.","We've also created some momentum in the early going this year with the return of Rachel Versus Guy, and we have high hopes for new seasons of Worst Cooks in America and Chef Wanted with Anne Burrell. In other words, Food Network is an iconic power brand and, make no mistake, a force to be reckoned with.","At Cooking Channel and DIY Network, the growth story continued unabated during the fourth quarter, both ended 2012 on a very strong note and are continuing to set ratings records. In fact, for both networks, 2012 was the highest-rated, most-watched year ever. Both benefited from a balance of archived content from their respective motherships and a fair allotment of original shows that give each network a unique personality of its own.","Now, this year on DIY Network, in addition to strips of Holmes on Homes, watch for new episodes of Rescue My Renovation, Garage Gold and, of course, the ever popular Crashers series.","On Cooking Channel, Not My Mama's Meals with Bobby Dean, Mo Rocca's My Grandmothers Ravioli and some new shows like Food Hospital and Taste in Translation with Aarti Sequeira will fill out the schedule. So look for some more good things from DIY Network and Cooking Channel in 2013.","And likewise at GAC 2013 promises to be an eventful year as we move the network with a more clearly defined Living Country lifestyle format. We're anchoring the network's emerging identity on last year's success of Farm Kings and Kimberly's Simply Southern cooking. Both original titles return to the network this year. We'll also be dipping into our archives for relevant shows to add depth to the schedule, as well as maintaining our important relationship with Nashville. We know that many of GAC's fans live country through song. So the network will still be home to the Academy of Country Music awards, the popular Top 20 Country Countdown and hit country music videos. We're making progress at GAC, positioning it for growth throughout the year.","And finally, our International business continues to evolve and grow. It hasn't been a year yet, since we acquired Travel Channel International but yet, we worked with the team in London to create a brand-new identity and on-air look and feel. And that includes migrating a good representation of our U.S. content to the global network. Shows like Bert the Conqueror, Vegas Stripped, Off Limits, Bizarre Foods and World's Greatest Motorcycle Rides are injecting new life into the channel and introducing media consumers around the world to the quality and engaging nature of our travel content.","Another positive development during 2012 was Food Network's continued and growing dominance as the leading lifestyle television network in the United Kingdom. Audience favorites there include Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, Man v. Food, Nigella's Kitchen and Everyday Italian, just to name a few. We also launched Food Network in Poland, Malaysia and the Philippines during the fourth quarter, as we continue to expand distribution into new world markets.","And finally, our equity investments in the U.K. and Canada had a very positive year. UKTV and its suite of 10 general entertainment and lifestyle networks had its best performance since its launch 20 years ago. They finished the year as the fastest-growing commercial TV network group in the U.K. with their audience up 10% from the prior year. And in Canada, HGTV and Food Network are firmly entrenched as a top 5 and a top 10 network, respectively.","So there you have it. 18 years of consecutive growth, strong fourth quarter operating results. We're delighting and engaging audiences in the U.S. and across the globe with our brand of lifestyle content. Advertisers highly value the [indiscernible] audiences that we aggregate and deliver, and our long track record of growing and creating shareholder value continues. So with that, let me turn it over to Joe NeCastro to discuss the financial results. Joe?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to touch on some of the fourth quarter highlights and provide some color on what drove our positive results. Then after a word or 2 on guidance, we'll open it up for Q&A.","Looking at the quarter and starting with a consolidated view, total revenue was up 9.2% on advertising and affiliate fee revenue growth. Total segment profit was up 3.3% which reflects the revenue growth coupled with a higher programming support cost and investment spending that were reflected in our annual guidance for 2012, and that we've noted on previous earnings calls. For the fourth quarter, income from continuing operations attributable to SNI was $2.02 per share compared with $0.84 in the fourth quarter last year. The current period, however, includes a favorable tax adjustment of about $202 million or $1.33 per share, which was partially offset by asset impairment charges of about $22 million or $0.15 a share. Tax adjustment in the fourth quarter 2012 reflects the reversal of income tax valuation allowances that were recorded as a result of the sales of Shopzilla and uSwitch. The asset impairment charges are a result of our annual impairment test for goodwill and relate primarily to a technology investment we made last year.","Prior year fourth quarter included favorable tax adjustments of $10.5 million or $0.07 a share. Excluding those discrete items for the fourth quarter 2012, income from continuing operations was $0.84 per share, while the fourth quarter 2011 was $0.77. EPS also reflects the effects of our share buyback program over the past 12 months.","2012 was another positive year with peer-leading results. Revenue was up 11% driven by 9% growth in the advertising revenue and 18% growth in affiliate fee revenue. Strong growth in advertising revenue reflects the highly desirable audience that we aggregate for our advertisers. It also reflects the success of our strategy to create relevant programming focused on the valuable home, food and travel consumer categories. These attributes resulted in industry-leading CPM increases in the 2011 and 2012 upfront and the very healthy scatter market that we experienced for most of 2012.","A strong increase in affiliate fee revenue in 2012 reflects the success we had in negotiating more favorable carriage fees for Food Network in prior years. A significant portion of Food Network's distribution base moved onto that new rate card in 2012. Our growing international distribution also contributed to the growth in affiliate fee revenues. Segment profit increased 6.5% in 2012 which reflects the ongoing investments in programming and various other growth initiatives and support costs.","Earnings per share attributable to SNI were $4.44 compared with $2.86 for 2011. This reflects the increased segment profit, the positive effects of our share repurchase program and the adjustment that I've previously mentioned.","Looking at the key revenue drivers for the quarter, we finished with advertising sales up 5.1% versus last year. Affiliate fee revenues increased 18%. Advertising revenue for our domestic Lifestyle Media segment was up 4.3% with international accounting for the remainder. As for U.S. advertising trends, fourth quarter scatter versus scatter pricing was up in the mid-single digits year-over-year and up in the mid-teens over the broadcast upfront. These metrics were a little lower than they had been running for most of 2012. For the first 3 quarters of 2012, scatter versus scatter pricing was running up in the high-single digits over the prior year. Also the fourth quarter 2012 was the first quarter of the new upfront agreements. If you recall that we characterized current upfront CPM increases as being in the high-single-digit range. That compares with the low-double-digit increases in the prior year.","As for advertising categories, our top 5 were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, natural and auto. These top 5 were pretty consistent for us all year long. One month into the first quarter, scatter advertising market continues to be healthy. Year-over-year, scatter versus scatter pricing growth is continuing to run in the mid-single digits and up in the mid-teens over the 2012 broadcast upfront. The upfront CPM increases we realized through the first 3 quarters of 2012 will be in the high-single digits. Turning to the distribution side of our business, affiliate fee revenue for our networks in the U.S. increased 15%, which is roughly how it's paced throughout the year. International Operations accounted for the remainder of the growth, primarily due to the Travel Channel International acquisition in the second quarter. As we previously stated, we don't have any sizable agreements coming up for renewal in the immediate future, so we expect a much more modest growth rate in distribution revenue for 2013.","Now, let's take a look at how our networks did in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. Revenues were up 6.8% on the advertising and affiliate fee growth I mentioned previously. Total segment costs were up 11% on higher programming and support costs, as we've discussed throughout 2012. As a result, segment profit was up 2.4% from the prior year period.","Turning to our International business, we generated $20 million of revenue that was included in our fourth quarter consolidated results, which was up considerably from prior year, again, primarily due to the Travel Channel International acquisition. The largest component of our international revenue is from distribution fees and our program licensing business with advertising comprising the remainder. We also generated $15 million of equity and earnings of affiliates with the majority coming from our international partnerships in Canada and UKTV in the United Kingdom.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our own stock at an average price of $58.58 per share for a total expenditure of around $100 million. We ended the fourth quarter with $438 million in cash, including $181 million we generated from continuing operating activities in the fourth quarter.","Now, looking at guidance. For 2013, we expect total revenue to increase 7% to 9%. This increase reflects expected advertising revenue and affiliate fee revenue growth in the mid- to high-single digits. Cost of services, of which programming expenses are the majority, are expected to increase 12% to 14% as we continue to invest on original content to drive viewership at all of the networks. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to increase 7% to 9%. SG&A expenses include investments that we're making in digital and international initiatives to drive future growth. Now, if you exclude the digital and international initiatives, the increase in SG&A is expected to be well under 5% for the year.","Other items we've offered guidance on today are as follows: depreciation and amortization will be $115 million to $125 million; interest expense is expected to be between $50 million and $55 million; our effective tax rate should be between 28% and 30%; noncontrolling share of net income will be between 175 million and 185 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $65 million and $70 million. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Janedis with UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is the first time, Ken, your growth at the big 3 networks has more or less converged in the fourth quarter. Would that new affiliate, do you know [ph], this year, is this a sign that they'll move closer together going forward? And maybe to what extent did ratings impact the ad growth or was it more of the upfront and scatter pricing you guys talked about?","Kenneth W. Lowe","I'll let John address the advertising piece of that.  John, over the 18 years, as I mentioned, 18 consecutive years of growth, we've experienced some ups and downs in ratings from time to time. Probably the most recent example is the housing industry and we shuffled the lineup at HGTV. But no, I don't necessarily think it means that they're getting closer together. One sometimes succeeds, in the case of HGTV and Food a little more than the other. But I think the word I use in the script, the consistency, and the fact that these networks constantly deliver with upscale female viewers and engaged audience, to me, it's just a matter of month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter ratings fluctuations that happen from time to time, and John can talk a little bit more about how we're seeing positive indicators on the Food Network. Fourth quarter was really unusual quarter in the sense that there's not only political, but we had a lot of impact of sports, there was the impact of Sandy. So we kind of walled that off and said look, we aren't happy with those results. Let's do what we always to do. Get back to the workshop and think a little bit about some different ways to do some of the series. But I'm very confident about Food in 2013. And John, you want to comment on John's question about the scatter market in advertising?","John F. Lansing","Sure. John, the pricing differential from the scatter, as Joe mentioned, the first 3 quarters of the year, the scatter was healthier by a few points. And then the change in the upfront pricing from the prior year's upfront to the new upfront also came down from low doubles to high singles. And that across the board, had the most significant impact on, obviously, ad sales revenue. There was some impact based on a softness on Food's ratings, to Ken's point. But on a happier note, we saw HGTV and Travel Channel really begin to gain a great deal of momentum in the quarter which is carried through into this year as well. In fact, just building on Ken's point, HGTV finished the year as the #1 network among all cable networks for upscale women, 25 to 54. That's the mark of the brand that we're building at HGTV and we're confident Food will continue their momentum as well.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","John, just related to Joe's comments about the top 5 categories, were they all up during the quarter?","Joseph G. NeCastro","I have to check, John. I can't remember. But I think, I can't think of any of them that were down to be honest with you. I think they're all up in the quarter.","Kenneth W. Lowe","We'll check, John, and get back with you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So it seems like, based on all your comments about the guidance, Joe, that it implies an acceleration in the advertising growth rate from here, meaning from what you just reported for the fourth quarter. So I'm just trying understand the puts and takes around that. I mean, does that sort of suggest that you had make goods or audience deficiencies that hindered you in the fourth quarter that should go away from here, i.e. you don't have a great deal of make good carryovers coming into the first and\/or second quarter? And so, are you just assuming that there's this sequential growth rate for Food ad revenue assuming ratings normalize? How should I think about that kind of implied acceleration in ad revenue?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes, look, I think you're right. If you do the math, it certainly would lend itself to the analysis you just gave us. I do think with respect to the fourth quarter, certainly there was underperformance at Food and that will be made up. But we also overperformed at HGTV and somewhat at -- we're right on at Travel. So for the company as a whole, we don't -- we're not particularly concerned about where we stand with respect to where we are with advertisers. We're sort of \"in the leather,\" as we say around here, where we, more or less, always are. So that wouldn't be the primary driver. I think it's still a ratings story and it's the sort of overall market growth story, more than anything.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow-up, maybe this is for John. Given the network -- the 3 big networks that you have, when you do have ADUs at Food, are you able to kind of satisfy -- to what extent are you able to satisfy those deficiencies on your other networks that -- so if you have HGTV ratings up and Food Network's down, can you kind of -- can you work that to your advantage in the spot market?","John F. Lansing","Anthony, on occasion, we'll do that on a advertiser-by-advertiser basis. But generally, it's sequestered to the network where the under-delivery occurred.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Could you give us a sense of how much you think International can contribute to affiliate distribution growth in '13? I know you circled that acquisition kind of earlier in the year. And then second, growth at Cooking Channel really has been a standout, really some amazing growth there. I guess based on what you're seeing from advertisers and ratings, do you think that growth can continue?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Let me handle International question first, Alexia. It's hard to quantify at this point. It certainly will have a positive effect on the overall growth rate, but we'll have a full year versus full year. So I think you're looking at a couple of percentage points on the year in terms of the improvement related to International. John's going to handle the question on Cooking Channel.","John F. Lansing","Alexia, Cooking Channel had a -- well, had its best year ever, as a 3-year-old network. The fourth quarter was the highest quarter in the history of Cooking Channel, and December was the highest month in the history of Cooking Channel. So it's clearly on a roll. But what's interesting is that's really all of a piece in terms of the Food category and the programming on Cooking Channel, much of it in fact, up to 1\/3 of it is programming from Food Network. And then some of the programs being developed is on an original basis on Cooking Channel then feed up in to Food Network. So the way these 2 networks work together, the strength of Cooking, not only is positive on its own, but it's helping to drive further growth on Food. Your question, will cooking continue to grow? It has and it will, in my view, because the ability to cross promote cooking on Food and on the Food digital properties really gives us a great advantage in the digital cable marketplace.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And John, you guys have all done a great job on Food and that food category in face of intense competition. Whenever you've seen softness in ratings, you seem to fix it and come right back. Is the competitive environment any different now with both food programming on prime time broadcasts or is it more of the same?","John F. Lansing","It's more of the same. And as I've said in the past there will always be one-off competitive programs on broadcast in other cable networks. But there will not be, in my view, another 24\/7 Food Network or Cooking Channel. One of the key reasons we developed Cooking Channel was to stave off competition on a 24\/7 basis and allows us to provide an environment that competes, I think, against one-off programs that, frankly, come and go. The competition, I think, they benefit to some extent but the programs have a short life span, typically.","Operator","And our question will come from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Mark, I have one question in 2 unrelated parts. The first one is, could you give a little more clarity around the actual ratings performance? So if you look at the 3 flagships for Food, for HG and for Travel, kind of key ratings metrics and key demos for 1Q and -- for 1Q to date and for 4Q, so we could see what happened and what the sequential change is. Then second, could you give a little bit more clarity around what the cash programming expense will be for 2013? And I guess, generally, what the run rate is for longer-term programming expense. Because for some of us, I think, this number was a little bit higher than we might've been expecting and just trying to think about a normalized run rate.","John F. Lansing","You want me to start with the ratings? So why don't we start with Food. Q4 was a challenge, for sure. To  Ken's point, we have one of our networks, Food Network, is really much more reliant on East Coast urban audiences. So the impact of having upwards of 10 million people without electricity for 2 weeks had a definite impact on Food and they climbed out of that. And sequentially, from November to December they had growth in those months. And then from December to January there was a slight bit of growth but we're seeing February off to a very strong start. So we're seeing sequential improvement, and if you sort of market it from Hurricane Sandy forward, we're seeing sequential improvement on Food, although we still have a ways to go. HGTV completed its highest rated year in the history of the network in the fourth quarter and it has charged into the first quarter now, and has sequentially grown from November, December, January, now into February with significant double-digit growth, which we're very pleased to see. And that's also the story at Travel Channel which has just, as Ken mentioned in the prepared remarks, has just registered its fifth straight month of sequential growth, it's double-digit growth. In fact, it's over 20% growth year-over-year in January. And as I look at February, I don't see that slowing down. So it's all a story of sequential growth. In the case of food, they're coming out of a bit of a hole following Hurricane Sandy, and they're moving out of that hole in terms of HGTV and Travel. They're both in the double-digit territory now, month-over-month over the last 4 to 5 months.","Joseph G. NeCastro","And David, let me talk about cash programming expense [ph]. Let me start with sort of the big picture comment. As we've said all along, our highest priority is what viewers see on the screen and we will continue to invest in programming as it's necessary. And the ongoing story of Travel Channel, as we continue to build that network. And we're going to spend a little bit more on Food Network in the year ahead as well. I think if you look at the rest of the guidance we gave, it's pretty clear that we're going to put our resources on the screen. We've got a very low increase planned for SG&A for the year. And even the investment spending we're doing is very modest, even relative to the prior year. So it's all about sort of \"all hands on deck\" and; putting the best programming we can on the screen and driving ratings going forward. That said, you saw pretty decent acceleration in cash spend in the prior year which is driving the amortization increase you see this year.  As what we think about cash spending for the year, I guess all I'm willing to say at this point is that the increase -- there will be an increase in cash spend year-on-year, but it'll be lower than the amortization increase you're seeing. And that should bode well for the year ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. Ken, first, can you outline which distribution deals include TV Everywhere rights? And whether you see an opportunity to open up distribution deals early in exchange for TV Everywhere rights?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes. I think, Doug, I'm just checking, some of our contracts, whether or not we've announced TV Everywhere, I'm not sure. If I can go check. I'm allowed contractually [indiscernible]. John is shaking his shaking his head. So, yes, I think we can. John?","John F. Lansing","I'd be happy to do that, Doug. We had a really strong year in terms of renewals, including Comcast DirecTV, Time Warner Cable, Cablevision and AT&T, all in 2012 with TV Everywhere deals. We're still in negotiations right now with one other, and to your question, can we open up a deal in order to move on TV Everywhere, that's, in fact, what we did, with a couple of these so that we can move quickly. It's our intention to work with the distribution industry to create this value proposition for our consumers and we're proud to be one of the leaders in the industry on the programming side to do that.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So then when we think about affiliate revenue in '13 and it's still slowing because some of those deals were done midyear, we shouldn't think about sort of 2012 was an annual -- 2013's the new base. So some of that might bleed into 1Q, 2Q growth?","Kenneth W. Lowe","No, it's going to moderate into '13 coming out of '12 after these renewals.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. The second area for the calendar upfront was pricing consistent with a high single-digit pricing, pricing you saw for the traditional seasonal upfront.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Calendar pricing was consistent with high singles, a little higher than the mid-singles in the scatter. Volume was strong in the calendar upfront I'm told from our ad sales group and that bodes well. One of the positive signs for our particular company is that the housing economy is beginning to perk up and the category that's beginning to show up on our top 5 categories in the first quarter and in the calendar upfront, is the Home Improvement category.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then last question, any thoughts on the buyback pace?  Anything you're willing to share as we think about 2013 capital deployment?","Joseph G. NeCastro","I expected that question earlier. Look, we will be -- we'll remain active and opportunistic somewhat. I think we're committed at continuing the program. I'm not willing to talk about pacing on the call but expect us to keep going.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Martin with Needham & Company.","Laura A. Martin - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So Ken, I would love -- you guys have been really great about moving your brands onto the digital platforms. And I would love to hear about -- on the digital side, could you size it in anyway, economically, for us? What it's adding to growth off of your core businesses, the size as a percent of revenue and specifically focused on mobile? I know you guys have gotten really aggressive mobile adoption, but I guess I'm still wondering, have you seen any money in that? And do you think there will be? And on Netflix, you're one of the last holdouts, of not moving onto the Netflix platform, even Time Warner has moved there with its serialized dramas, so are you talking to Netflix and Amazon? And could you talk about the upside from those, if you think that's a legitimate way to distribute some of your product?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Let's just start with the digital piece of it because it plays a little bit back to Doug's question about TV Everywhere. You're right. We have, for a long time, really, I think, exploited digital growth for us. It started with websites and, of course, it's moved on from there. I think the important thing is, we've been able to attract a certain degree of revenue because of our power brands and the engagement of the audience to keep these viewers, not only engaged on TV but onto our websites, the apps that we've launched in 2012, as a matter of fact, John may have to help me, but I remember the In The Kitchen app was the most successful in the culinary world, and then in the Travel Channel, No Reservations was the most successful app launched there, as we move more to an iPad and a mobile strategy. And you will continue to do see us evolve to that. I think, Laura, again, it's what you know. Some of the digital revenue that we all hoped would probably continue to grow at a pace that we saw 3 or 4 years ago has slowed down a little bit, especially on some of the display. That gives us an opportunity to transition to some of these other business models, if you will, in our categories and I don't need to tell you how lucrative the home, food and travel categories are. So it's going to continue to be a big part of our business. As you see, we continue to invest in that area and we will. We think it's a big of the future. If holding [ph] TV Everywhere and what we hope will be quality measurement at some point, and we do believe that that will happen in the not-too-distant future, I think it bodes well for, not only our business model, but continuing to take out more than our fair share in the advertising world and our genres across multiple platforms.","Laura A. Martin - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Netflix?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Go ahead and talk about Netflix, Amazon, et cetera.","John F. Lansing","Yes so, Laura, it's John. We are, in fact, talking with everybody and being judicious about it. We're weighing, frankly, as we have been, all along the upside of the incremental revenue against any downside it might create in terms of ratings competition for the incumbent business model, if you will. But I'm confident that we'll have some announcements coming in the next few months as to some of those distribution deals as the discussions have advanced very well.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Michael Morris with Davenport.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","First question on programming investment and the return on that investment. And I guess the question is number one, how much stronger are ratings for a new original show on your more mature networks, Food and HG versus, let's say, a repeat in the same time slot? I'm curious if you have any data there. Second, when you look at some of the softness at Food in the fourth quarter, is this a problem that you think you can solve or address with higher or incremental programming spend in the coming year at that network specifically and is that in that guidance? And then just over on corporate and other, obviously, the losses have been a bit bigger there as you've invested in a couple of items, including International. What's the -- how should we be thinking about that into 2013 and beyond,with respect to when we're going to see some more revenue there or when you have kind of inflection points on the investment decision?","John F. Lansing","Michael, let me start off and then Lori, I think, will talk about the investment side. On your programming question, you're exactly right, investment in new original programming has a direct benefit to an improvement to ratings and, therefore, to ad revenue. A great example of that was a year ago, in February, the team at HGTV determined that, it would make some sense to invest in having an original episode of House Hunters and House Hunters International every night of the week throughout the year of 2012 and the immediate benefit of that to the network is what we're reaping today, as it created, not only a ratings success story for that time period as it was stripped across the entire week, but also a stronger promotional platform to launch a new series on top of that successful existing series, which the network did during all 3 quarters of the year and into this quarter. So now we have upwards of 20% ratings growth off that programming and investment decision a year ago. To your question about Food, we keep thinking of the fourth quarter as a \"soft quarter.\" It's still probably, if I think about the fourth highest quarter in the network's history, if not the third. So it's still a network that is a top 10 network. It fell out of the top 10 for one quarter. It's going to fight its way back, and the only way to do that, frankly, is to do what HGTV did and that's invest in new original programming for existing franchises and then launch new franchises off that growing base of audience.","Kenneth W. Lowe","Michael, if I could just add to John's comments. We still have the most efficient programming cost in the industry with excellent margins. I think when you see percentage increases, sometimes there's forgetfulness that everybody's kind of raised their game in the cable network business over the last couple of years. And when you have the power brands that we have and the connections to our viewers on all these platforms, we have to invest and will continue to invest, not only stay on our game but keep these networks in the positions that they're in. I mean, when we say we're #1 with women, 25 to 54, and we have these incredible environments that advertisers cherish, that's something to invest in and that's what we're going to continue to do and it's been our business model from Day 1. So Joe, you want to swing...","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes, Mike, let's do a quick swing through the investment portfolio, if you will. Just to be clear, we're talking about at least 3 different initiatives. The international spending and then, of course, these 2 digital investments we've been talking about for a little better than a year now. I'd say, obviously, I'd take those separately. On the international front we feel like we're getting very good traction but it's a difficult business to predict because, as you know, we're in sort of a development phase there and we're looking at different transactions and relationships, and some organic launches as well. What we've got in the guidance is continuation of our rollout internationally and we're going to be as aggressive as possible there to distribute these brands globally on a prudent but a fast timeline, if we can. With respect to the digital businesses, they are 2 very different business models and I think it'd be fair to say, as we look around this table, we've spent more than our share time thinking about the spending pace that's appropriate for those opportunities and trying to measure the traction that they're getting and spend sort of commensurate with the opportunities as we see them growing. If we didn't believe in them, we would be telling you on this call that we're not pursuing them anymore. We do. We think they're good investments and we're going to continue to pursue them as long they continue to get the kind of traction we expect. So your question had more to do with what we think the inflection point is on those. I'd say those are sort of developing business plans. We would expect to spend or be in a deficit on those 2 business for at least a couple more years, as we build them. But again, we're not going to spend unless we see that there is traction and that we're hitting our milestones. So I think, if anything, we're going to be very, very careful about the spending level that we put behind those 2. So it'd be difficult for me to tell you the exact inflection point, but I would expect probably 1 to 2 years out, we'll start to see an effect on the top line. Now, let me just end by saying that the all-in investment next year in those 3 is up not even 10% from the current year's. So while we are continuing and we believe in them, we're being very careful about how much resource we commit to them.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. if I could, you spoke about House Hunters, in particular. Do you have a sense, kind of back of the envelope, what the ratings or the audience for a new episode of House Hunters looks like relative to a repeat?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, we'll get that you because that's a fact we can look up. But it's measurable. It matters.","Operator","And the next line, we go to Michael Nathanson with Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have 2. One would be for Ken, one would be for Joe. Ken, you've been a programmer a long time and you guys built some great businesses. And I just wonder, if you look at the volatility at Food or even HG over the years, what does that say to you about kind of the need to continue to invest in content? I mean, do you think there's just -- whether it's reason [ph] side or more competition? Maybe you guess fatigue of repeats? But what does that say to you about kind of the overall tone of the business? Because everyone's got volatility so as a programmer, do you think we're just at a heightened state now of going forward of just spending on program? And I then have one on SG&A for Joe, we're done.","Kenneth W. Lowe","It's a good question, Michael. I mean, you and I have talked about this in the past. I think we are seeing a bit redundant, there's no question that the really good years of cable networks over the past 2 or 3 years, where we've seen these incredible increase in ratings across the board, to the point that the gap between broadcast networks and cable now is closed in many cases. In many nights, cable networks will outpoint shows on broadcast networks. So the game has gone up, ratings have gone up, revenues have gone up. And what we saw, for example, in the fourth quarter was not just some audience softening at Food. But some of the other major cable networks were losing the audience as well , back and forth. And we saw some swapping in numbers as you saw with the broadcast networks. I think, we're just in a different period. It's a little more competitive. You're probably going to see more audience shifting going forward. That's just something we're all going to have live with. Again, what I like about our models, Michael, is the consistency of always having these brands, always going to a home brand, always going to a food brand, always going to a travel brand, and day in and day out, if you've not got the top 3 hits up and down the cable dial, you have the consistency and, of course, we sell across all day parts which is critically important as well when you have these power brands. So unfortunately, as I said earlier, in 18 years, we've seen fluctuations.  We're going to continue to see fluctuations.  We will continue to invest in programming and marketing. And as I mentioned, we have the most efficient cost and, to me, it's not an ever-increasing number that just continues to go up and up and up. There is a point of investment for the sake in investing and investing in quality shows. And sometimes, we all make the mistake of investing in shows that don't work. Again, nothing new there. But there's really no place to hide now for cable networks because we're front and center on any given night. Just the other night Food had a spectacular night. And when you have those and you can -- and it was followed up I think the next night, John, by HDTV. So yes, it's a different time, Michael but it's still a great time to be in this business and we couldn't be more pleased to have the brands that we're involved in and the investment that, as I said, is still some of the most economically priced programming in the business.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And can I just ask a follow on, on that one, on SG&A to, Joe or to John. Even yourself Ken.  When you see everyone doing, all your competitors, they're spending money on programming and they're committed to that. But they're also killing their SG&A line. If you look at the average guys who have reported the past week or 2, people are spending 0% to 2% increases on SG&A. You guys don't do that, you mentioned marketing. What's the philosophy on how much can you control SG&A aside from marketing? Is that something maybe there will be a step down going forward in SG&A spending?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes. Mike, look, I think part of that is that -- marketing spend is included in the SG&A line and that number is, in many ways, used to support the programming investment. So it is true that in years, when you're launching new shows, you sort of want to make sure that you've got adequate marketing support for them as well. Look, our philosophy is no different than any of our peer group. We don't really want to spend money on anything that doesn't show up on the screen. And so I think you're going to see us, while we've guided to sub-5% growth in those areas, I do think it'll be closer to the peers, ultimately. We just are not ready to bang the drum and say, we'll be at 0% to 2%. I would say that, that's certainly our objective is to hold those costs flat over time which, obviously, is a real cut. And we're working on that. So I would stay tuned on the SG&A line. We're very focused on that and I think you will see results that are better than the guidance on that.","Operator","We next go to the line of a Amy Yong with Macquarie.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Research","Can you just talk about why the ratings at HGTV are a little bit more stable than Food? Is it, again, competition-specific to a food genre or it's just that HGTV programming resonates a little bit better? And then can you also explain the success between Cooking versus Food then?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Sure, Amy. Happy to do that. HGTV is on a roll. There's no question about it. As you look back over the last few years, HGTV has been relatively flat during a period that Food was growing double-digit year-over-year. So HGTV is roughly a 14th ranked network while Food still remains a Top 10 network. HGTV's success today is very similar to the success Food had over the last couple of years and we're happy to see that. I think Food has a little bit of a quirk, in terms of the comparison to HGTV, because it's a little more urban, a little more East than West Coast. HGTV's a little bit more C and B county, Middle America, in many cases. So the audience composition is different. HGTV's a little older. It's a little more skewed towards women. More 75:25 women to men, Food is a little bit more 60:40. So there are differences in the audiences, that would explain some of the differences in the ratings. But overall, both networks have had their periods of growth and periods of dips and periods of just steady, steady-state. And if I were to define where both networks are today, I'd say HGTV's on its best growth spurt in the last several years based on this investment in programming and the management of the brand, the marketing of the brand and the scheduling as well. Food Network, I have seen this pattern before with Food Network that they've had one quarter dip and then come out of it on several occasions and they're already showing signs of doing that. And then the Cooking Channel, we think of Cooking Channel as sort of our indie studio, if you will, where we can be more experimental. And people that run Cooking Channel for us are all of a team with the Food Network team, they aren't separate teams, it's the same programming team. And it really gives them a place to try new concepts, try new talent and then see what works on either channel. So we really don't -- in the way we manage Cooking Channel, it's really manages part of a food initiative, not as a separate entity.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I know there have been a lot of questions on programming but if I can just ask one sort of on the same topic, because I think everyone sort of focused on the same issue. If I just went back to 2009 and compared either on your amount of GAAP expenses on programming or the cash outlays on programming through 2012, and those numbers sort of CAGR-ed at 14% and 30%, respectively. And if I just take a broad measure of your ratings, sort of all shows, all day parts, all demos, they seem flattish, nominally, over that same time period. And so, my question is, is that the wrong way to look at it? You don't really measure the efficacy of your investment in terms of ratings? Or is it just -- is it the new table stakes for the industry? You just have to spend more or embed in there were there just a lot of misses that sort of lead you to believe that you can get the same sort of ratings with less spending or different spending?","Kenneth W. Lowe","Yes, I'm not sure you can take that out of context. I mean, if you look at the industry, in general, and you factor in sports rights of some of these other channels and the CAGR would scare you to death. So I think what I said earlier, that we've all had to raise our game a little bit and I think that's resulted in much stronger ratings across the board for cable networks and, in some cases, I don't want to stay -- staying in place or trying to look at it sequentially from -- if you're spending this much then ratings should be going up this much. It's just not the way it works. It's your share of advertising. It's how the other guys are faring. We go through these periods where competition shows, for example, there's a flurry of competition shows. Idol leads to The Voice leads to dah-dah-dah-dah-dah. Some of the extreme programming, the phase we're going through right now. And that will attract audiences for a while. But to get it, the risk of being redundant, the consistency of our brands, the consistency of people knowing what they get when they come to our brands and, in some cases, yes, you invest a little bit more in production, in talent, but over time, I come back to our -- look at our model now, look at efficiency, just from the standpoint of however you want to measure it. Against total revenue, against total expenses. We've got some of the best programming cost in the business and we're going to continue to invest. It's our lifeblood and it's how we build these businesses and it's what you're seeing in 2013 and I'm very comfortable that the people we have at these networks are just the best in the business. We'll continue to deliver strong ratings across the board.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have 2 questions on -- guidance-related questions. Joe, you gave us some good detail on the SG&A pieces but I'm a little confused. I think you said the new initiative spending would be about, up about 10%. And that the non-new initiatives would be up about 5%. The think the new initiatives last year, I think it's sort [ph] of $30 million number and maybe I'm thinking -- maybe this is apples and oranges, but that math doesn't work. So maybe I'm thinking about the wrong dollar amount associated with these.","Joseph G. NeCastro","Yes, let me -- I can provide some clarity there. It's just math. The impact that we talked about last year, that $30 million is the sort of profit impact. It also happens to be the expense impact because there wasn't any revenue associated with it. Or very little revenue associated with it. This year, there's a fair amount of revenue in there, so the expense impact is much higher but the net profit impact is the plus, actually plus less than10%. That's the number that I was quoting.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then you guys had mentioned earlier, you expect to have an announcement on digital, whether it's Netflix or Amazon, TBD some point this year. Is that factored into your revenue guidance or how should we think about that?","Joseph G. NeCastro","It is factored in.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then lastly, maybe for John, you'd mentioned I think on the Comcast-TV Everywhere deal that one of the things you were waiting for and expecting was for Nielsen to measure streaming consumption better. And that was really important. And I think you thought it was coming early in 2013. Can you just update on whether that's happening and whether you're satisfied in sort of the capture and of all the viewing that's happening on your networks, it's obviously a big industry seem [ph] these days?","John F. Lansing","Ben, it's a point very well taken and it's a concern of ours, frankly. We were told to expect measurement for streaming services by the first quarter of '13 and here we are, we're staying in close contact with Nielsen. It's a -- I understand it's a complex problem for them to solve but we understand that it still is expected to be available by the end of this year and we'll be watching closely to make sure that, that's the case.","Operator","We will be taking the last line from Alan Gould but right now we go to the line of Barry Lucas with Gabelli and Company.","Barry L. Lucas - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","One or 2 more little quick ones, if I may. John, you say you're still in a hole, a ratings hole on Food. So am I to take from that, that Food ratings are still down year-on-year?","John F. Lansing","They are down year-on-year in January, yes.","Barry L. Lucas - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And when you said -- you talked a little bit about the strength of the calendar upfront being up mid-high single in terms of CPMs and good volumes, so even though that's a relatively small part of the ad business that you sell in the course of the year, I'm taking from that, that there should be a positive bias in terms of 1Q, 2Q ad revenue performance out of that?","John F. Lansing","It is. To your point, it's a small piece, and as we weigh all the pieces, there's the new broadcast upfront pricing, the scatter which is, as Joe said, still mid-singles. We have some high hopes that the scatter will improve going forward. But I'd say right now, we're in about the right place in terms of expectations for the quarter.","Barry L. Lucas - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And last one quick one for Joe and give you a chance to not answer again but Tribune now solidly out of bankruptcy for more than a month. Any update at all you can provide as to whether or not you're talking with them and what the prospects for closing out the interest would be?","Joseph G. NeCastro","Barry, I'm happy not to answer that question again. You know every bit as much as we know. That's all I'll say at this point.","Operator","We go to the last question from the line of Alan Gould with Evercore Partners.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Two programming questions. First, if one excludes -- if you exclude the Travel Channel, is your increase in programming cost mostly more hours, more original hours at these networks or is it more a higher cost per hour for the programming?","John F. Lansing","Alan, just real quickly. It really is more related to cost per hour than it is to number of hours.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And lastly, your program payments on the cash flow statement have been higher than your amortization of your program assets on the income statement for 2 years running. 2011 was a $91 million discrepancy, 2012 $136 million discrepancy. Can you explain how this happens and doesn't it have to then flow through to the income statement?","Lori A. Hickok","Yes, it absolutely does flow through to the income statement, it's the timing. It's just a matter of your spending ahead of, how you amortize. We amortize that over a period of time depending on the type of show.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I'm just wondering why the last 2 years the discrepancy grew so much larger than it had been in the prior few years.","Lori A. Hickok","Well, you have Travel, which you mentioned, that to be one piece, it's Travel. And then just more hours and cost of programming going up. It's just a matter of the investment you heard Ken and John speaking about -- throughout the call today. Just investing in the screen and in our programming.","Mark W. Kroeger","Thank you, everyone. We'll be -- Mike and I will be available for the rest of the day if you have any questions. Cara, you're free to give replay instructions.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay today after 12:30 p.m. through February 21, 2013 at midnight.

And some of these factors that may cause results to differ are set forth in our publicly filed documents including our Form 10-K.","With that, I'll turn it over to Ken.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Dylan. Good morning, everyone. As always, we're happy you're able to be with us today. It's no exaggeration to say that Scripps Networks Interactive is really hitting a high mark. This year, we've successfully grown our ratings, our advertising and International revenues, our digital audiences and international reach. We've done that by focusing on what we're good at and delivering consistent environments that consumers and advertisers love. This is sustainable growth driven by the strength of our brands and our content, not driven by special events, sports or election coverage. We've also finalized long-term contracts with key distributors that secure significant carriage in mid to high-single-digit rate escalators into the early 2020's. Plus, we're included on new OTT platforms enabling us to reach new audiences away from traditional linear TV services.","Now Burton and Lori will go into the details on the quarter shortly, but first, I'd like to take just a few minutes to speak about the broader strategy and our vision for growing the company. Over the last 22 years, we have built our business upon a number of key pillars. Number 1, growing our brands and our audience. Number 2, maximizing how we monetize; Number 3, managing our costs wisely; Number 4, expanding our footprint into new markets; and Number 5, reaching new audiences on emerging platforms and services.","Looking at those one by one, we're seeing some significant traction in 2016. First, we have grown our brands. These brands, particularly HGTV, Food Network and increasingly, Travel Channel, remain powerhouse content brands with unique appeal to consumers in both the United States and around the world. That appeal is clearly reflected in our results. In fact, in the United States, five of our six networks are up in sales prime year-to-date, an incredible achievement given the competition from Olympics and the Presidential Election. Scripps Networks Interactive was the only network group whose impression gains were not driven by news during the 2015-2016 television season, a testament to the enduring appeal of our content.","In the current media landscape where consumers have more options than ever, strong brands win. We work tirelessly to develop remarkable brands with unique positioning. HGTV and Food Network are already must-have brands. And we're building another right now at Travel Channel. We hit upon strong consistent programming that resonates with a growing high-income audience. As we intended, Travel Channel is becoming the go-to place for compelling travel entertainment. And speaking of must-have brands, in the 2016 Brand Relevance Index recently published by Prophet, Food Network was recognized as a top 50 brand that consumers can't live without. In fact Food Network ranked number 36 and was the only cable or broadcast television brand to make the index. Pretty remarkable.","The reason we're able to grow our networks amid the current shifting macro environment is that our audiences know that regardless of the time of day or day of week, they can find high-quality content on our networks. Our programming is inspiring, trustworthy and engaging. And consumers respond by tuning in and staying tuned.","Secondly, we maximize our monetization by delivering to our advertisers the lucrative upscale audience they covet. Our environment is naturally optimized for advertisers. We inspire viewers to improve their lives and our advertisers provide them with the messages and the tools to take action. Our advertising partners know that our brands consistently deliver and engage audiences better than anyone else in the industry, as revealed in the 2016 Brand Identity Study by Beta Research. Not only do our viewers tune into our quality programming, they watch the commercials and importantly, they're inclined to buy what they see.","When you create strong brands with must-have content like Fixer-Upper or Chopped, you become increasingly essential to distributors. While increased consolidation in the distribution space makes negotiations more complex, our networks deliver clear value on both price and popularity. Now as a result, we've successfully renegotiated important long-term deals and we continue to enter future negotiations with confidence, thanks to the size and nature of our audience.","And we're also seeing distributors looking to include our networks in their OTT and skinny-bundle services including the recently-announced DirecTV Now. Our brands are included on all the virtual MVPDs that have launched to-date and we're excited about how consumers are responding to those packages.","With one of the most loyal and consistent viewer bases in the media industry, our networks could be termed the ESPN for women. Just like ESPN, HGTV and Food Network are cornerstone brands that adults, but in particular women, tune to time and time again. In fact, according to Nielsen Research, viewers of HGTV and Food Network, especially women, tune in more times per week and stay tuned for longer periods of time than viewers of ESPN. So, as you can expect, our networks deliver an outsized proportion of the value consumers derive from their TV packages. In short, our must-have lifestyle brands are essential to the consumer which makes them invaluable to distributors and advertisers and allows us to maximize our monetization.","Now, turning to cost management, our track record on managing overhead, I think, speaks for itself. We've done a good job of investing in content and that investment consistently generates revenue growth. As I've said before many times, creating great content is the best method to accumulate sustainable returns. But we also pay a lot of attention to our investment levels to ensure that we not only incur the costs that deliver the best possible return to our overall business, but it just continues to be a good investment.","The uniqueness of our content married to the fact that we fully own it presents a tremendous value proposition. We take full advantage of our content across multiple platforms and geographies in a way that most other media companies cannot, helping drive deeper levels of monetization for every dollar of investment.","A great example of this comes from our acquisition of Poland's leading media company, TVN. Already a strong business in its own right, our expertise in lifestyle enables us to secure greater value from the business through utilizing lifestyle content, formats and brands in the Polish market. We strive to be good cost stewards for the company and managing our expenses effectively is a vital principle in our success.","Now beyond the United States, we have tremendous opportunity to grow our brands and that leads me to the fourth pillar of growth and that's to expand our global footprint. The last few years have been particularly exciting. Food Network has successfully expanded throughout Latin America and for the first time recently, launched in Mexico. Just this past Friday, we announced additional distribution in Brazil where Food Network is now available in nearly 7 million homes. The reception we've had in these new markets is highly encouraging.","We're also making great strides towards the global rollout of HGTV, a top priority for our International team. This year, HGTV launched in New Zealand, increased distribution across Asia, and just this past Wednesday, began airing in 24 countries across the Middle East and North Africa. Moreover, we'll launch HGTV in Poland next year. This will be HGTV's largest launch ever outside the United States. And needless to say, we're very excited. Additionally, we're working to increase our other brands' presence on the TVN platform over time.","And speaking of TVN, it's been more than a year since we acquired the Polish media standout and we've made good progress. The Polish economy is among the best in the region and TVN, with its own robust broadcast, pay TV and DTT channels, along with our leading OTT service player, has exceeded our high expectations. TVN achieved 23% market share during the quarter, even against a strong competitive environment that included the Olympics and popular soccer broadcasts. While advertising in Poland has softened slightly in recent months, TVN continues to outperform the market in both ratings and in revenue growth.","And we're also excited to launch Cooking Channel in Canada in partnership with Corus Entertainment. Cooking Channel, which is the perfect pairing to Food Network Canada, will be launching on December 12.","Lastly, emerging audiences and new distribution platforms bring scores of exciting opportunities, which our digital services are aiming to capitalize on. We want to reach consumers wherever and whenever they demand high-quality lifestyle content. And we're working to ensure that we reach the next generation of lifestyle enthusiasts and to create content that is purposefully designed for digital formats.","Since its launch late last year, Scripps Lifestyle Studios has driven a significant increase in our online and social media engagement and content creation. Now Burton's going to share some of our fantastic results coming out of the studio shortly.","We maintain the same vision that we always have: to inspire and inform the lifestyle categories that we dominate, whether the content is delivered through linear television, skinny or fat bundles, short form digital video, or TV Everywhere. That vision really does not change. But the ways in which we make that content come to life will evolve to stay ahead of consumer preferences, just like we've always done.","In many ways, it feels if \u2013 the industry is merely moving towards a model that Scripps Networks Interactive is positioned to excel in. We own our own content, which means we're better able to exploit our programming across all platforms. We have a focused number of strong brands that really resonate with consumers in an environment where powerful brands win. We have categories that are a perfect fit for advertisers. Our networks are focused on genres that lead themselves ideally to digital and mobile platforms. And we believe our model is ideally positioned to capitalize in this current marketplace.","Our networks have come a long way since we introduced HGTV in 1994. We have become the unequivocal leaders in lifestyle programming. I believe we have the right plan and definitely the right team in place to continue to excel in this fast-paced media world.","I want to thank you for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. And now let me turn it over to Burton who has details on our third quarter results. Burton?","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to say that in the third quarter, our strong operating performance continued. HGTV had another impressive quarter for ratings. It was the highest rated third quarter ever among all key demographics and it was the fourth highest rated quarter in network history for sales prime and total day. In addition, HGTV ranked as the number one cable network among women 25 to 54. This is even more amazing, really, when you consider that we had the impact of the Olympics and the U.S. election during the quarter.","Viewership among millennials continues to gain traction at HGTV. Sales prime for millennials improved 27% in September, driven, in particular, by the hit show, Flip or Flop: Selling Summer. This series was the number one show on our networks among millennial viewers in the quarter.","Food Network ranked number six among women 25 to 54, improving on its prior year position for the quarter. Among millennials, Food Network was a top 10 network driven by premiers of Cooks vs Cons and top performing show, Food Network Star.","At Travel Channel, we continue to see the positive results from our programming investments. This quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter for year-over-year growth. Sales prime ratings were up 11% among adults 25 to 54 and impressions were up 5%. A recent success was Travel Channel's four-part special, Expedition Unknown: Hunt for the Yeti. The show ranked among the Top 20 ad-supported cable shows for its time slot among adults 25 to 54 and generated ratings that were up 30% from the year-ago timeslot. With more than 7 million viewers tuning into the series, Expedition Unknown: Hunt for the Yeti was one of Travel Channel's all-time top performing shows for October.","Recently, we aired All-Star Halloween Spectacular, the first-ever programming simulcast between our Big Three networks. The special event brought together multiple network stars as they engaged in a Hollywood-themed adventure, all for the benefit of charity. Our strategy was to leverage the scale of each brand in an innovative way. We had more than 5 million viewers across the three networks watch the simulcast. And given the level of success, we expect to do more programming that takes advantage of the broad reach of our combined networks and digital footprints.","At DIY network, the third quarter now ranks as the highest rated and most watched third quarter ever. Sales prime ratings increased 17% for adults 25 to 54 and 22% for women 25 to 54 versus a year ago. Cooking Channel scored its highest rated and most watched quarter in the network's history for sales prime among both adults and women 25 to 54. And finally, Great American Country continued its double-digit growth, improving 29% for ratings and 24% for impressions versus the prior year.","At Scripps Lifestyle Studios, our growth continues to hit new and exciting levels. Scripps Lifestyle Studios achieved approximately 1.5 billion video views across all our digital platforms, which include our owned and operated websites, social networks, and TV Everywhere. This represents a 50% improvement over the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, our digital teams published more than 1,200 new content videos.","Scripps Lifestyle Studios averaged 250 million unique visitors monthly on all of our digital platforms during the quarter. I'm pleased to say that for October, we exceeded that impressive pace and had more than 350 million unique visitors on all of our digital platforms.","In October, Tubular Labs, a leading social video measurement company, ranked Food Network number two for social videos in the food category behind only Buzzfeed's Tasty. Food Network received more than 745 million video views last month. And at the fourth annual Cynopsis Digital Model D Awards, which honor the best in online video content, Food Network won the award for Best Social Media Campaign for its use of Facebook and the award for Best Web Video for its feature on square deviled eggs. All three of our big networks received multiple honorable mentions at the award ceremony, a testament to the incredibly creative content our digital teams are producing.","Now on TV Everywhere, the platform is showing signs of growth with 19.3 million views in the third quarter. We're pleased with the progress we've made with TV Everywhere usage. We hope to see even more. Overall, it was a successful quarter with some remarkable results for Scripps Lifestyle Studios.","Finally, we assessed and analyzed the S5 Universe and have made the strategic decision not to extend our SVOD agreement with Netflix past the end of this year. In the end, it really is not the kind of dual revenue model that best monetizes our content over the long term.","Now turning to our International Networks, the last several quarters have been especially exciting as the company continues to grow. July marked one year since we finalized our acquisition of TVN. The Polish network group delivered another successful quarter with revenues growing mid-single digits in local currency compared with the prior year. Ratings for the network group increased 3% for the target audience. In fact, TVN was the only major network group in Poland to increase market share in the quarter. With 23% market share, TVN has solidly established its leadership position among all the network groups in Poland. We couldn't be more excited to bring HGTV to Polish audiences next year. As Ken mentioned, expanding HGTV globally is a key goal for the company. Our Central European location provides a great launching pad for our expansion plans and growth on the continent. For example, TVN will begin to manage the Food Network and Travel Channel brands in Poland to help drive programming production opportunities and operating efficiencies. Previously, the International team in London managed these networks.","Integrating our lifestyle brands into TVN was a primary objective that we hope to accomplish when we initially explored the acquisition. At UKTV, share of commercial impact was 10% in the quarter, another all-time high for the network group.","UKTV networks Dave and Drama continued to dominate as the Number 1 and Number 2 non-public service broadcast networks in the country, helping extend UKTV's leadership position in the UK.","2016 continues to be a fantastic year for our company. We're optimistic about the wealth of growth opportunities available for our lifestyle content, both in the United States and internationally. And now I'll turn it over to Lori, who will review the company's financial performance.","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Thanks Burton, good morning everyone. This morning, I'll highlight the consolidated numbers, discuss our segment performance, provide some comments on guidance and then open it up for Q&A. Consolidated revenues in the third quarter totaled $803 million, an increase of 3.5% compared with the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, coupled with overall ratings and impressions growth and increases in our International business. In line with our expectations coming into the quarter, consolidated adjusted segment profit decreased 2%, primarily due to the increase in programming costs, partially offset by the advertising and International revenue growth.","Consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% compared with the prior year, primarily due to a reduction of interest expense as we deleveraged and gains on foreign currency transactions. These items were partially offset by a decrease in adjusted segment profit and a reduction of equity and earnings of affiliates, primarily related to the sale of our investment in FOX Sports South in the first quarter of 2016.","At our U.S. Networks segment, revenues grew 4% driven by strong advertising demand for our lifestyle networks, partially offset by the expected and temporary decline in distribution revenues. For advertising revenues, increases in CPM pricing, coupled with ratings improvement, drove a 7% year-over-year increase in the third quarter. Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter with CPM high teens year-over-year and up mid to high 20% over the broadcast upfront.","Our Top 5 advertising categories during the quarter were food, retail, consumer packaged goods, automotive and financial. These categories are consistent with the historical performance of the third quarter. The strength of the scatter has continued into the fourth quarter. Scatter versus scatter CPM pricing is up mid to high teens year-over-year and up high teens to mid-20s over the broadcast upfront. As a result of the rate equalization impacting 2016, coupled with industry subscriber decline, distribution revenues for U.S. Networks decreased 2.5%. The declines in rates in subscribers were partially offset by negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top broadband providers.","On the expense side, as a result of the planned difference in the timing of programming premiers between 2016 and 2015, cost of services for the U.S. Networks increased 13% in the third quarter. However, program expense growth is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2016, as we will premier fewer programs compared with the prior year. We noted in previous quarters that we've shifted some marketing and promotional expenses to later in the year. Due to the continued advertising strengths and ratings improvement, we were once again able to defer marketing expenses out of the third quarter. As a result, we expect to realize a significant increase in marketing and promotion expense in the fourth quarter. Reflecting the increase in advertising revenues, offset by the decrease in distribution revenues and an increase in programming related expenses, adjustment (sic) [adjusted] (24:16) segment profit for the U.S. Networks declined 1%.","International Networks revenue increased 4% to $123 million on a reported basis. However, the majority of International revenues are generated by TVN, and in local currency, the revenues increased 6% compared with the same time a year ago. International adjusted segment profit increased 31% to $15 million compared with the third quarter of 2015. This improvement reflects the increase in revenues as well as operating efficiencies from the ongoing rationalization of our international support structure.","In addition to our consolidated operating results, in our equity earnings, including certain remaining U.S. minority interests, are our unconsolidated International operations. These include UKTV, Food Network, HGTV and DIY Network in Canada and some TVN minority investments. These International properties now comprise the majority of our equity income. In total, equity in earnings of affiliates was $8.5 million, down from $23 million in the prior year. The decline is primarily related to the sale of our investment in FOX Sports South earlier this year and the timing of revenue recognition at certain minority investments.","On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the third quarter at approximately 2.8 times gross leverage, down from 3.2 times at the end of 2015. Based on the expected retirement of debt in the fourth quarter, we should end the year at approximately 2.5 times gross leverage. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We plan to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, reduce our leverage and invest in M&A both domestically and internationally. Given those goals, we did not buy back any shares during the quarter.","Looking at guidance for the remainder of 2016, we are reiterating all of our previously issued guidance. And in line with past practice, we will address 2017 on our next earnings call. We feel positive about the trends we are seeing and how the business is positioned, including our ability to grow revenue, adjusted segment profit and free cash flow.","And with that, we will open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. We'll take our first question from John Janedis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. It looks like Travel Channel may have had its best year since you acquired the network. And I know you guys alluded to this, but can you remind us if you're at a point where the number of original hours is nearing or at peak and does that mean programming growth stabilizes closer to the rest of the group going forward?","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Hi, John, this is Burton. Thanks for that observation. Yes, we're very proud of that accomplishment and it really is the result of what we talked about throughout 2015, which was putting on a lot of pilots that we tried. A number of them were successful. They've continued into this year. And our programming team is developing even more. We did talk about growing our programming investment there for exactly this reason. The number of hours at Travel Channel has grown as a result; that's purposeful. It isn't where Food and HGTV are in terms of the number of hours, that's also purposeful, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We do think we're reaching a level where the growth in our programming spending is going to moderate year to year. We won't see it grow at the same rate. That said, we always say internally and externally, if we find a hit on Travel Channel that we can produce in quantity, that we know will result in higher ratings and therefore higher ad revenue, we'll make that investment in programming. So I think your basic assessment is correct. Moderation in that growth rate, but we're clearly, clearly seeing the investment there pay off.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Okay, Burton, thanks. And maybe separately, can you give us a little bit more color on the SVOD strategy going forward? Meaning, do you look to go it alone or partner with a direct-to-consumer offering or do you think the better monetization path here is with the MVPDs?","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Yeah, John, I think if you look at where the industry is going and tracking, we just see a lot of opportunities with, as Burton mentioned, the dual revenue stream model. We have such compelling content for advertisers that we just don't want to really cut ourselves off from any opportunity. Having said all of that, we gained a lot of internal knowledge on the digital side and on the best way to monetize this content, including the further expansion and development of our digital sales team. So, it's no different than what we've been doing the last several years. Just looking to the best opportunities and being a company that owns its content, looking at the best place to partner in most cases and monetize. So no real change. Just opportunistic.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","All right. Thanks a lot, guys.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Sure, John.","Operator","Thank you. Next question will come from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my questions. First one for Lori. You've been clear you guided to low single-digit declines in distribution revenue heading out of 2016 and you also have talked about mid to high single-digit affiliate rate increases in 2017. And what I'm interested in is, can you please bridge for us the difference between the rate growth and your distribution revenue growth expectation in 2017? Or simply put, how many points of drag of headwind from subscription declines ought we expect in 2017 given the trajectory of subscriber, the pace of subscriber declines that you're seeing at this time? And then I have a follow-up.","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Okay, well, Anthony, I think again, you very well articulated what we've said previously that we are expecting, based on past negotiations and even those that we're continuing to go through, that on the rate side, that we're going to be at that mid to high single-digit price CAGRs. So the drag will be the subscriber assumptions there. Our universe assumptions aren't any better than anyone else's, but I would say looking at what you're experiencing this year is probably a good proxy for that. So we're in that 1% to 2% on our core networks, that's probably a reasonable estimate going forward. I think digital networks are a little bit higher just based on the skinny bundles and what's happening there. But again, I think what's more important as we turn the corner, we're going to go from seeing year-over-year quarter declines to where we're going to see growth again. So looking forward, I think 2017 is going to be a much more positive story on the distribution front here at SNI.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, thanks, Lori. And then maybe for either Burton or Ken, this relates back to the first question, but your fully distributed networks are outperforming the other networks. You can see that kind of in the revenue actuals. I know that for some of your distributors, including the emerging OTT platforms, only those top three networks are included and clearly that has mix shift implications for affiliate revenue, for overall revenue. The bigger picture question is, are the better economics that you're getting on the three flagship fully distributed networks offsetting the contraction in distribution that you're witnessing for the non-core networks? Thanks.","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","I'll start and then Lori can chime in as well. I think basically, what we've said all along about the distribution of our three fully distributed networks holds when it comes to new distribution opportunities. These are designed to be included in the most distributed packages on all of these virtual MVPDs and OTT services. That's what we've negotiated for. We continue to do that in talks with any new player coming in and actually, that's what we've achieved. The digital tier networks, they were designed to be on digital tiers from the get-go many, many years ago in the case of DIY, for example, and the way that our monetization works, they can be on digital tiers and still allow us to do just fine. Lori, did you want to add something on that?","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Well, I think, Anthony, what you might be referring to is you're probably looking at the quarter and year-to-date revenue for the diginets versus the fully distributed and seeing that they're not performing at the same level. I will say on the advertising, they're performing just as well. In fact, we're seeing phenomenal growth there. What you're seeing is the impact primarily of consolidation impacting those networks, as well as migration where we had quite a sweet deal with the U-verse deal as those subscribers migrate off. So, again, I think very strong performance again on the ad side and again, most of our economics, as you well know, come from those three big networks anyway.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, thank you very much.","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Thanks, Anthony.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Vasily Karasyov with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. One quick one on advertising. Has been very strong for you this year. Can you just highlight for us now that we are nine months into it, what exactly is driving the strength there? Is it the scarcity of GRPs in the market, demand, budgets increases and so on? And then I have a quick one on virtual bundles.","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Well, Vasily, this is Burton. Honestly, it's no secret and it's consistent with what we've always said. It's a combination of the strength of our brands, the consistency of our environments that we offer on all of our networks and our audience having a higher median income, in fact, collectively the highest group median income in the industry and by not our research, but external research, a greater propensity to buy the products and services that they see advertised. In the end, we provide a terrific environment for advertisers to place their ads, particularly endemic advertising that's consistent with our categories and honestly, the market comes to us because we provide those attributes.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And then one on virtual bundles. In your presentation, you say that you are carried by those that are already in the market and you talk to everyone who is thinking of launching it. If those bundles take \u2013 and get traction, what do you think it will mean for you? Does it even change the way you do business? Are you indifferent between a traditional MVPD on a virtual bundle? Is it a good development for you or is it just neutral? Can you please reflect on that in the midterm?","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","I think it's somewhere between neutral and opportunistic. I think for us, again, as you heard in the opening comments that advertising is a big part of our business model. We like dual-income model, so our strategy is really to put our brands and our content in front of subscribers and consumers wherever that may be. So we really look at it somewhat agnostically as long as we can get content on these different platforms and take advantage of the opportunities and how to monetize that. So, I would say opportunistic is the positive side; but at worse, neutral.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Hey, Vasily, it's Ken. Let me just add. I think as we see more opportunities to secure data with the consumers, we actually think some of these virtual bundles, if you will, are the opportunity, if you will, to maximize in interactive advertising, targeted advertising, and you know the usual list. Actually, I underscore what Lori said. I'm a little more optimistic that I think some of these new deals are additive and certainly opportunistic when we look at being able to really maximize, if you will, on the value of the content we created and how important it is to advertisers. And we're seeing some of this already in things that we're doing with the Scripps Lifestyle Studios, which Burton mentioned, with great success in short-form videos. So, I think the more opportunities, the more distribution partners and with technology continuing to evolve, there's great upside for a company like SNI.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Fiftal with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. Wanted to ask about ad rev trends in the fourth quarter. I think the guidance you reiterated, I mean, I think to get to the top-line guide, it more or less implies that ad revs should decelerate in the fourth quarter and I think previously, you guys had talked about third quarter being the low water mark given competition from the Olympics and that kind of thing. So, is this really a function of guidance being conservative? Or is there anything in the fourth quarter we should be thinking about as the headwind? Thanks.","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","I really think that the fourth quarter is going to be strong. I think I would look at our full-year guidance to give you a good indication of where we think it's headed. But again, it's very healthy out there. The scatter market pricing which we gave the stats in, in our prepared remarks are holding up. Our upfront was strong. A lot of times, it's a matter of the mix of what's in the play, whether it's more upfront versus scatter pricing. So, on the pricing side, we're seeing great strengths and it's very healthy. On the impressions side, our networks continue to perform. And as a portfolio as a whole, we are a safe haven for advertisers and a place to make sure that you are getting your advertising seen during this holiday season, which I'm sure they're trying to get their goods moving across, through the registers and et cetera. So, I would just point you to our full-year guidance, but we're seeing continued strength on pricing.","Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Hello. Thanks so much. I've got a bunch of short questions, so hopefully that will add all up to sort of the normal length of one long question. But more on advertising. The first is, are you able to quantify what you think the Olympics impact might have been in the third quarter?","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Well, no. I mean \u2013 not any more than the results that we've disclosed. I guess that's what I would say.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","It's fair to say that it must have had some impact, right? I mean, you certainly had a very good quarter relative to a lot of your peers, so it's not as visible.","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Well, yes. It's not as visible for a couple of reasons. You see in our results that we did have a higher programming cost in the third quarter. That's purposeful. We do program aggressively against the Olympics in order to mitigate their impact by keeping our impressions as consistent as possible. So, I guess that's a way of answering how we kept advertising robust. It's in sync with that increase in programming.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Hey, Doug, this is Ken. I'm going to expand the answer, which means you can ask \u2013 now you have to ask fewer questions. My comments, we talked about weathering the storm against not just the Olympics, sports in general, and all the coverage from the presidential election, I think this continues to underscore that we're a lot of people's \u2013 we've always said is kind of the second choice. You dial around, you see this, you see this, there's lifestyle programming that's very comfortable, there's family viewing, there's a lot of co-viewing going on. So what's encouraging to me is not just the Olympics, but how well we're doing up against sports in general and how well we've held our own during this election coverage, which has been really remarkable when you consider the amount of viewing that's been going to debates and presidential election coverage. So we're holding up very well.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","And, Lori, when you were talking sort of upfront versus scatter, are you able to give us a sense for the fourth quarter, how much you would think you'd be selling in scatter versus percentage you might be selling in upfront or have on long-term deals?","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","No, one, I'm not that close to the details and we typically don't disclose that. But again, what I'm pointing out is year-over-year, both pricing is strong. So you're seeing, we've got a strong upfront, so that's good. So that piece is going to be a lift from the upfront that we realized a year ago. And the scatter pricing continues to be very robust. Again, based on that strong upfront, as we look forward to 2017, we expect there will be some contraction, but not seeing it yet.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Sorry, last question for me. This might be a jump ball, but I'll throw it to Ken first. On the food JV, I think \u2013 any details you can give behind whether there's any changes in term? Is there a put-call arrangement that's put in place? Is there still right of first refusal? Any change in the relationship at all with Tribune?","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","No, Doug. I mean, it's business as usual with those guys. I mean, this is \u2013 I don't know how many times you and I have had this question and answer, but as you saw, we just extended our agreement for additional four years. They continue to be a great partner. It's a great relationship and I'll just leave it at that.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Can I ask if the agreement...","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","No, no, no. Now wait a minute, Doug, you said it was your last question. But go ahead. Okay one more. One more.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Well, I was just curious. If the agreement had ended, had terminated and you couldn't come to an agreement on a renewal, what would have happened?","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Well, the good news is we came to an agreement.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","We'll find out in four years. Thank you.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Laura Martin with Needham. Please go ahead.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Great numbers.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Thanks, Laura.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Just a couple of big picture things. Do you want to weigh in on the ESPN and Nielsen debate about sub growth for fully distributed networks? Did you guys see a big step down sort of in the recent period in fully distributed subs?","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Well, Laura, look, I'll let Bob weigh in on ESPN. But Burton can talk about \u2013 as far as the sub loss that's been in the news in the last few days, as far as Nielsen's pause and then a pivot. You want to comment on that, Burton?","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","I guess all I would say is, I think we've seen what Nielsen has put out there. And as Lori said, we're sort of in line with our projections where we think sub growth or declines would be for our various networks. So, steady on for us I think is what I would say.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Talking about \u2013 I love the stats on digital, by the way, love the 350 million uniques and the 250...","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Thank you.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","So, can you talk about pricing for those? Like when you talk about impressions compared to viewership ratings, can you talk about \u2013 I assume they're much younger, I'd be interested in their demo mix, but I'm also really interested in your pricing. Do you get quite a bit higher pricing or do you roll it into your overall guaranteed delivery with the big networks and sell it all? Just you can guarantee younger audiences. How do you do the pricing on those impressions?","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","It's Burton again. Thank you for the observation on digital. We're very, very happy with it, too, considering that we just launched the Scripps Lifestyle Studios less than a year ago. The quick answer is, it depends. So, on TV Everywhere, of course, within C3, that's the standard mix of our television advertising that's included on the linear network in the C3 ratings. When it comes to dynamic ad insertions, insertion on video, typically CPMs are higher. Of course, the volume that you need is much greater, which is why the actual revenue numbers are smaller. So, that said, this is why we're making this push. We want to have a huge amount of growth in the viewing of our short-form digital video content. Our ad sales team is confident that they can monetize, but we started this concerted effort less than a year ago and we're very happy with the results we've seen so far. But we're going to keep watching it in 2017. As far as younger goes, that also depends. It depends on the platform. On SnapChat, much, much younger for our Food Network content. On our own owned and operated websites and apps, for example, that's a little more consistent with our network median age, a bit younger, though, overall. And then in social media, it's kind of a mix, but generally speaking, it is younger.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Hey, Laura, it's Ken. The one thing I would just add, I've talked about this from time to time, this continues, if you will, to form our internal education, is the word I like to use, or really experience in this whole area. So, as you hear numbers that we're proudly talking about in the digital studio, short-form video, et cetera, it's just giving our ad sales team more and more information about how to deal with this, how to go to our advertisers, how to go to our clients. And let's be honest, at the end of the day, there's still a question about how, in some cases, digital is really \"working\". Is it ringing the cash register? But the important thing is for a linear television company to be in the early-stage development and be in these discussions and be in these sales pitches makes a lot of sense. And just for Thanksgiving, I'm going to send you the square deviled egg video because I know you'll use it.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Excellent. I needed something for my Thanksgiving feast. I do think it helps you. You're having a \u2013 a lot of your new channels have like the top millennial show you've ever had. And I'm sure that's coming out of those digital learnings and data. So, it's helping it out...","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Absolutely. And we're seeing that, aren't we, Burton?","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Yes. And the other thing I would add is you may recall that about a year ago, we did consolidate all of our networks under the leadership here in the U.S. of Kathleen Finch. And then just a few months ago, we even brought together our digital content teams with our television teams. And I have to say that the amount of learning that's going back and forth and the cooperation has been more than we've ever seen, which was the intent of creating that organizational change in the first place.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Last question on Big Enough. So, the most articulate advocate of being a sort of small strong network, has been Les Moonves over at CBS. That leadership is waffling now because if he buys Viacom, he's going to have a big mess and a lot of networks that aren't in the top one, two, or three anywhere. So, my question to you, Ken, is, are you big enough? You got these three strong networks and they got to be in every bundle, but is that big enough to protect against this enormous consolidation and distribution which right now is a downdraft to your distribution fees in the U.S.?","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Well, look, Laura, I think our results speak for themselves. It's a question, I think, I've been getting for 20-some years. It's about the quality of the brands. I mean, we're perfectly happy sitting here domestically with six brands that are performing very well. You heard five of the six are up in impressions and in ratings. I don't know what else you can do to send a message to distributors and advertisers than success. And so, whether you have 6 channels, 20 channels, it's about quality and it's about the ability to come to the table and offer brands that are relevant and valuable to our distribution partners. And again, I think you're hearing today in all of the skinny bundles, in looking to 2017, which we'll see some increased distribution growth in subscription revenue. Yeah, we're big enough. Look, it's going to continue to be a consolidated world, but that's been the case for the past 15 years. We've seen consolidation on the cable distribution side. It's just now there's getting to be some heft. But I think, for example, if I may, we never comment on M&A. But the one takeaway from the AT&T and Time Warner announcement is content is valuable. And it's going to continue to be more valuable if it's quality, original and there's great storytelling, and in our opinion, it's lifestyle-targeted. So, long-winded answer to say, yeah, we're in good shape and I wouldn't trade our position with anybody else right now.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","All right. With that, Happy Thanksgiving, guys. Thanks a lot. Good numbers. Thanks. (48:32).","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","All right. You too. Thanks, Laura.","Operator","Thank you. Next in queue is Ben Mogil with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. So, on the digital front, you made a couple sort of meaningful investments, Pluto, Refinery29, Tastemade. Sort of, maybe you can talk a little bit about how you sort of view minority investments, how they're integrating not necessarily operationally, but from a learning perspective with some of the digital stuff you're working on. And just sort of how you view minority investments, in general, going forward?","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Well, we \u2013 actually we're very happy with the ones we've made to date. And as you can see, they're really about educating us and also getting a return. So, I think it's a two-fold proposition for us. But I have to say, we've been very pleased and we've learned a lot. And they also have a different \u2013 we're a public company, so the things that they can go out and do and how they experiment is much different than how we, as a public company, go out and experiment. So, it's a way to participate and learn. And we bring that back to our own learnings, which we're learning as you can see through what you've seen with the Scripps Lifestyle Studio. So, that's kind of us out here learning and experimenting, but then participating through this. So, again, we keep watching long term.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","And Ben, if I might just add...","Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Please.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","I'd say, this continues to be pretty much in our wheelhouse and that is the recognition that things are changing and they will continue to change. So when we look to the future audiences of HGTV and Food Network and Travel Channel, instead of waiting for them to \"grow into our brands,\" we're out right now learning as much about we can as their particular lifestyle and their particular needs, which sometimes cannot necessarily be incorporated into programming when you're targeting 30 plus. So, as Lori said, sitting around a table and being minority investors in companies that are truly targeting millennials, and allowing us to, if you will, learn along with them, I think is invaluable five years down the road. And you'll see that in some of the things that we'll continue to do to bring younger viewers and younger users onboard.","Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's great. Thank you. And Lori, just as a follow-up, or Ken, as a follow-up. Is there a path to control for some of these investments should they turn out to be exactly what you're looking for?","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Not going to really comment on the terms of those individual deals. But again, I think the proximity, if we like them, were a little closer in strategically, we're probably considered more of a strategic investor than just a financial player, which the other opportunities that we can partner with these along the way too, for just different things on commercial terms that benefit both the early-stage company as well as us.","Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And next in queue is Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, hello. At the risk of piling on this digital theme of conversation, you might remember this earnings call in the future as the one we all talk about digital, but there's so many interesting tidbits you put out there. Burton, the one that I caught on to, correct me if I heard this wrong, I think you said a billion and a half digital \u2013 maybe that was views. You can correct me if I picked up the wrong stat you said there, but I'm sure that's a lot of growth, it's a big number. So my question is this: how does that relate to the $36 million or so of, I guess, advertising revenue that you report as from your digital businesses? Do those both map to the same thing or is it other revenue and other places that maps there? And then if they are the same thing, is there anything wrong with just doing the math of dividing a billion and a half views by $36 million of revenue? That would tell me about a $24 CPM, I think, if there was one ad per view. Anything wrong with that math. Thanks.","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","I'll start but since it's math, I'm going to turn that over to Lori in a second. But you are correct about the views. Just another bit of chest-thumping although we don't want to get ahead of ourselves here for our digital team. That number was close to nothing in terms of video views a year ago. So it is a remarkable increase. It's extremely purposeful. We set ourselves a task. If you go back to our call a year ago, I think we did first talk about launching the Scripps Lifestyle Studio because we saw an opportunity here. We are \u2013 a billion and a half sounds like a lot, but it's not anywhere near where we want to be, to be honest, because of the math. You need a lot of views even at a high CPM and I'm going to let Lori comment if she wants to on your calculation. And so, we've still got a ways to go, but we've made a good start.","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","The one thing I'll say about your calculation is it's in the ballpark of what CPMs you get for these type of content leads today. But I would also point out that again, and Ken made this point earlier, that some of this is more R&D as we learn. A lot of times, the views come ahead of the monetization. So again, I think as we go into 2017, we'll continue to ramp this up and continue to see more monetization tied to the engagement that we're driving. Also, to your point, it is more of the tools that our ad sales team can go out and sell. So sometimes these things are being sold as part of a typical linear deal. So you may not see all the value actually being allocated to digital. So I think we have to be very careful. In fact, I'm a little nervous about digital numbers as we go into the future because I think it's going to become so integrated that it's really internal allocation how you're doing this. But we do know that they're important and they're helping to drive and without these things, that would not be a good position for us to be in long term. But I would say, we're still learning on how we're going to monetize these and package these in with a broader offering.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That all makes sense. Thanks guys.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","All right, Todd, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question will come from Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. I have a shorter-term one first and then a longer-term one as a follow-up. Just first on the shorter-term one, I was wondering if you could give us an idea of what your expectation is for ratings performance in the fourth quarter. Just trying to understand if maybe you outperformed in the third quarter or if you just outperformed what we all thought you would be against the Olympics. And related to that, on the affiliate fee side of things, I think you've got maybe another rate harmonization kicking in the fall. So I was just wondering if you were already seeing that in the Q3 numbers or if we have a bit of incremental harmonization that will show up in Q4 and beyond.","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Thanks, Steven, I'll start with the ratings. Fourth quarter, we expect to be consistent with what our projections have been for this year. We tend to \u2013 it depends on the network. Food Network tends to have a good fourth quarter. We are loading up with holiday programming. Some of our other networks also do well with holiday programming, but I would say we're looking at the fourth quarter ratings in line with our projections as they were earlier this year. And Lori, on the affiliate.","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","So again, I would point you to our full-year guidance. We certainly still have some negotiations that we're going through in the back half of the year. Again, I would look at our guidance for the full year and again, I'll just reiterate that looking forward that we expect growth to resume next year based on the contracts we've negotiated in the past, combined with what we think the offset will be from subscriber losses as that continues into 2017.","Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then, maybe a separate question. I think one of your peers Discovery has talked about the power ratio, the ratio of what your economics are verses what your ratings are and I think it's probably more favorable for you all than for anyone else in the universe. And that just makes me wonder on the OTT side, do you eventually just stand up something of your own, let's say, $2 per sub per month and extremely accretive to what you're currently doing on the linear side? So my thinking about anything wrong there and what stops you from going down that path in the relative near term?","Unknown Speaker","Sure, Steven, look, I don't think you're thinking wrong in the sense of the value of our content and our power ratio. But as far as thinking of OTT, look, we're very, very happy with our distribution partnerships and the new partnerships that we're creating almost monthly, there seems like a new announcement, a new platform. So no, we have no immediate plans to think in those terms. But, again, I think when you own your content, you control your destiny and those options are always out there down the road. And I think that's what encourages us about not necessarily just being a linear television company, but as Lori alluded to earlier, evolving into what will be a linear digital content company and that gives us enormous opportunities to evolve and move this company forward. And...","Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","And I think \u2013 thank you, Steven. I think we've got time for one last question, operator.","Operator","Sir, that will come from Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, fellows. Two topics, one is guidance and one is ownership. On guidance, the high end of your range for adjusted segment profits seems to imply a mid-single-digit decline in that metric in the fourth-quarter. Can you confirm whether that's accurate math? And if so, why are you expecting that profit decline given what you're saying about the top line and the timing of programming costs.","And then second, on ownership of programming, can you talk about fully owning the programming? A lot of the key shows are produced by third parties, House Hunters and Flip or Flop, things like that. So can you explain, do you own the episodes? Do you own the formats? And do you need to actually own those companies? Those production companies in the future? Would you acquire them or is there any risk that somebody else could come in and bid those types of shows away from you?","Kenneth Wayne Lowe - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, Michael, let me \u2013 look, I'll do one open on that. We actually started when we bought Cinetel Productions to launch HGTV in owning production companies. And so we have great experience in that. Having said that, and Burton can talk about your very question, but we see the future in formats, in the ownership of content, not necessarily owning production companies.","Burton Jablin - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","And the quick answer to your question is, we own, when we talk about owning the content, we own the episodes. We own the format rights. We own the concept. We have great relationships with production companies now around the world. And so, we work in partnership with them, but we retain the ownership rights of all that's produced and that's been true pretty much from the beginning. There are a handful of exceptions to this, but as a percentage of our overall content, remember it's 2,500 hours a year roughly for domestic networks. It's a very small percentage. And this is just the way that we've done business over a long period of time, develop great relationships with production community. We develop ideas in house, we get ideas from outside and work with them collectively and that's how it all comes together.","Lori A. Hickok - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","And then on your other question, and I think this again, is couple comments that I made during the prepared remarks. One is marketing, we continue to defer that into the fourth quarter, so we intend to use that marketing that was budgeted for the full year and embedded in our full-year guidance as well as programming, as we set up and invest for the long term.","Dylan Jones - Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Thanks everyone for listening in today. As a reminder, Mike Gallentine and Sarah Burnett will be available for follow-up calls throughout the rest of the day. I'll now hand it back to the operator for replay information.","Operator","Thank you very much.

During today\u2019s conference call, phone lines are in a listen-only mode, and we will have an opportunity for a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to our host, Chief Communications Officer, Mark Kroeger. Please go ahead.","Mark Kroeger","Thanks, Nick, and good morning, everyone. On the call with us this morning is Ken Lowe, our Chairman, President and CEO; Joe NeCastro, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer; Burton Jablin, President, Scripps Networks; and Lori Hickok, Executive Vice President of Finance. We'll start the conference call with prepared remarks that should take about 20 minutes. Then we'll open it up for questions.","Let me remind you, if you prefer to listen in via the internet, go to our website, click on the Investor button and find the microphone icon on the landing page. Additionally, on the page under the microphone icon, you'll find our third quarter earnings presentation materials that we'll be referencing during the prepared remarks portion of our call.","An audio archive will be available on the site later today, and we'll leave it there for two weeks so you can access it at your convenience. During the Q&A this morning, please limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many people as time allows.","Let me remind you that our discussion this morning will contain certain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from those predicted, and some of the factors that may cause results to differ are set forth in our publicly filed documents, including our Form 10-K.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Ken.","Ken Lowe","Okay. Thanks for that Mark, and welcome to everyone. We\u2019re glad you\u2019re joining us this morning, and as always, we appreciate your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. You know it\u2019s been just a few weeks since we celebrated the 20th anniversary HGTV, and I still find it hard to believe that it\u2019s been two decades since we laid the foundations for a strong and growing business, that is Scripps Networks Interactive today.","Back in 1994, our nascent organization was characterized by a fervent entrepreneurial zeal and a commitment to compelling lifestyle content that would connect with audiences everywhere. Very pleased to say that same spirit and commitment exemplify this business today.","We\u2019ve built, acquired and developed some remarkable brands with unique positioning. We\u2019ve demonstrated unswerving commitment to extend our reach across multiple platforms and geographies, and we have consistently delivered a large and upscale audience that delivers high value to our advertising and distribution partners.","From television to tablets and the smartphone to the magazine stand, our brands attract millions of engaged upscale consumers, 190 million each month in the United States alone. And that number is growing rapidly across the world.","The consumers we engage have high disposable income to spend on our advertisers\u2019 products and services. An independent research shows they consistently do what they view. In other words, we don\u2019t just put commercials in front of people, we actively influence their purchasing decisions. That\u2019s a compelling value proposition to advertisers, and is part of the reason Scripps Networks Interactive brands continue to be a must buy in the media plans of businesses seeking to target upscale consumers.","Of course entertaining content is fundamental to growing that upscale audience. This year, we expect to produce more than 2,500 hours of original programming, and that\u2019s an investment not just in today, but in the long-term future of this company. We believe firmly in the value of captivating new program and our ability to monetize it both in the short and long-term.","Now as you\u2019ll hear from Burton in just a few minutes, our networks continue to perform very well in the fourth quarter, and we\u2019ve seen record high viewership levels in a number of areas. That performance has continued into the New Year. Indeed with the exception of ESPN, which benefited from some high profile college football games, HGTV was the fastest growing network among cable\u2019s top 20 in prime time for adults last month rising by 8%.","When you see growth like that, you\u2019ll understand that we really do have the ability to navigate these changing waters successfully. We\u2019ve always believed that lifestyle content connects well beyond U.S. borders and the last six months has been a resounding endorsement of that.","With the launches of Food Network in Brazil, HGTV in Singapore and the roll-out of more channels and shows across the globe, our international business continues to represent significant potential. Organic growth remains strong. While that entrepreneurial zeal, I mentioned, ensures that we\u2019re always alert to opportunities to deliver further returns on investment.","Being nimble and able to take advantage of tactical openings as they emerge is important to our business as we grow. Consumer behavior has changed markedly over the last 20 years, and we have always adapted to ensure that we reflect and lead that change. And that includes making sure that we have the right organizational design and structure.","Now as you\u2019ll recall from our last earnings call, we were then in the midst of a company-wide operational review in November to recalibrate the business. Joe is going to talk about the restructuring later. But getting cost in line is vital to our continued good stewardship of the company.","We\u2019re not immune to the issues and trends driving the broader marketplace. Even with ratings growth at most of our networks, scatter price improved weaker than we anticipated, and as a result, we came in narrowly below our revenue expectations in the quarter and full-year, but the fundamentals of our business remains strong. The nature of our upscale audience, our compelling content and our commitment to innovation means that we are well positioned now and for the future.","At Scripps Networks Interactive, we have consistently demonstrated an ability to innovate and adjust. As a management team, we are as passionate as ever about finding new ways to engage with people and that\u2019s a key focus for us in 2015.","Now as you know, we\u2019ve made exceptional progress with our TV Everywhere partnerships, actually leading the industry with virtually 100% availability of our content. Now there is still work to be done to communicate the benefits of TV Everywhere, but we are in a very good position to capitalize on this opportunity. Several of our networks including Travel Channel, HGTV and Food Network are now among those offered by the new Dish Sling platform, which launched earlier this week.","This really offers just a way to reach and remain relevant to millennials who may not see the traditional cable or satellite bundle as a first entertainment choice. That\u2019s the philosophy behind Food Networks becoming a launch partner on Snapchat\u2019s Discover service, which went live at the end of last month. We\u2019ll continue to experiment with new ways to reach audiences through the course of 2015, and we\u2019ll also continue to monetize our vast programming library through digital downloads, as well video-on-demand services such as Netflix.","Our commitment to delivering the content that consumers demand to an audience that advertisers crave regardless of the platform or geography is fundamental to our business. It\u2019s a philosophy that I believe will ensure our growth for many years to come. With strong experienced management, ready to take advantage of new revenue streams, this is a business structured for future and one moving forward with confidence and with purpose. Put simply, we have a lot of great things happening at Scripps Networks Interactive.","So with that, let me turn it over to Burton to bring you up to-date in more detail on how our brands are performing. Burton?","Burton Jablin","Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. As Ken said, we have a lot of great things to talk about that position this company well for future. Let me say a few words first about the full-year, which was a good one for our networks, both HGTV and DIY Networks scored record-breaking ratings in 2014. HGTV enjoyed its best year ever and finished as the number three network in all of cable among women 25 to 54 in prime time.","For the eighth consecutive year, HGTV was the number one cable network among upscale women, an important milestone. It\u2019s also a significant point of differentiation for our advertisers wanting to reach the female audience that makes the vast majority of consumer purchasing decisions.","These are the consumers with the disposable income to buy the products and services our advertisers present. Ken mentioned HGTV\u2019s January rating surge and here are a couple of reasons why we\u2019ve seen that impressive growth. Our new show, Fixer Upper, is proving to be a smash hit, and in January, led to HGTV\u2019s highest rated night in five years.","If you\u2019re not yet familiar with this show, it features a husband and wife team, Chip and Joanna Gaines, who balances their remodeling business with the realities of parenting four small children. It\u2019s clear the HGTV audience is quickly developing a deep connection with this couple and with the series.","January also brought much anticipated premier of Ellen's Design Challenge, a series produced for us by Ellen DeGeneres. More than 3.9 million viewers tuned in for the inaugural episode in late January, an audience that was 50% higher than the time period average.","DIY Network also was setting records. The network group\u2019s adult prime ratings 8% in 2014, total day and weekends broke records as well. December closed the year strong, with ratings up 40% year-over-year. And in January, DIY scored its highest ever household rating.","Some of the top series driving new viewers to DIY Network included Building Alaska, Holmes Makes it Right, Rehab Addict, the Vanilla Ice Project which continued to perform very well for the network.","Cooking Channel also had a great year. Prime time ratings there grew 9% in our target demo of women 25 to 54. Adults\u2019 prime time viewership in January rose another 10%. And Cooking Channel was the single fastest growing cable network in terms of household distribution in all of 2014.","Great American Country also saw its highest rated year, as we move forward to evolve the programming toward the country lifestyle format, primarily using cost-effective library contents. January brought greater gains to Great American Country, with adult prime time ratings up by one-third over the previous year.","Our increasing placement of lifestyle programming drew a more affluent audience, and by year\u2019s end the networks median household income exceeded the cable average.","At Food Network in the phase of highly fragmented competition, ratings among women aged 18 to 49, rose 6% in prime time over the year, as we continued to lower the audience median age. Overall adult 25 to 54 ratings were flat for the full-year and declined slightly in the fourth quarter.","However in January, Food Network returned to cable\u2019s top 10, ranking ninth among adult women. The New Year started with the return of the popular show Worst Cooks in America and fan-favorite Duff Goldman is back with two series that premiered just in the past couple of weeks.","We have a new series All-Star Academy premiering in March. And over the next few weeks, we\u2019ll be rolling out new episodes of Beat Bobby Flay, Chopped All-Stars and Cutthroat Kitchen, as well as premiers of weekend in the kitchen favorites, Pioneer Woman and Trisha's Southern Kitchen.","So we remain encouraged and optimistic about the programming schedule to drive continued audience at Food Network. One of the Scripps\u2019 lifestyle hallmarks is the upscale audience we deliver for our advertisers, and we\u2019re starting to see that at Travel Channel. The moves we\u2019ve made resulted in the networks\u2019 highest prime time median income in five years. In fact, the audience median income rose every quarter in 2014 and reached a high of about $66,000 in December.","Looking ahead, we have a strong slate of on-brand programming coming. This includes the launch of 20 new shows throughout the year that build a clear and consistent program environment, featuring great storytelling by entertaining talent.","One of our new series, Booze Traveler, is already off to a good start and has been delivering that consistent upscale audience. In fact the recent episode featuring Mongolia resulted in our best Monday night ratings in more than two years, and we\u2019ve already renewed the series for a second season.","Another new show, Expedition Unknown, double its rating in week one, tripled in week two and continues to perform well. In fact, last week it was the second highest rated show on the network.","At Travel Channel, we\u2019re confident in the path we\u2019re on as we guide the network to become the go-to place for compelling travel entertainment.","Now on the international front, Ken mentioned the Food Network launch in Brazil and HGTV in Singapore. Last year also brought several Food Network and Travel Channel launches in Eastern Europe, Travel Channel in Austria, Asian Food Channel in Vietnam and Food Network and HGTV in Australia.","Later this month, we will launch pan-regional Food Network feed across Latin America. HGTV\u2019s Property Brothers, Drew and Jonathan Scott are headlining a three city Asian tour this month across the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore for a series of launch activities.","Food Network is still the number one lifestyle channel and the third most-viewed lifestyle channel in the U.K. Prime time ratings were up 9% year-over-year and up 15% in the fourth quarter. In the roughly one year since we introduced Fine Living in Italy, more than 40% of the country\u2019s TV households have tuned in.","Looking ahead, our number one priority is to continue building scale and expanding the distribution of our networks internationally.","So there is a quick outline where we stand and where we\u2019re going. I\u2019ll give now to Joe and Lori to get into the numbers.","Joe NeCastro","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to touch on some of the full-year and fourth quarter highlights, and Lori will provide some color on what drove our results in the quarter. She\u2019ll discuss our 2015 full-year guidance. Then we\u2019ll open it up for Q&A.","For the full-year, revenue was up 5% to $2.7 billion, driven by 6% growth in advertising and 5% growth in affiliate fees. The growth in advertising revenue reflects the desirable audience that we aggregate for advertisers, coupled with the positive pricing and audience delivering environment that we experienced through most 2014.","The increase in affiliate fee revenue primarily reflects the annual escalators in our affiliate agreements and some ad slot revenue. Segment profit increased 2% in 2014, which reflects the revenue growth noted, partially offset by the restructuring expenses and the ongoing investments in programming, marketing and our international operations.","Earnings per share attributable to SNI were $3.83 a share, including $0.06 of restructuring expense and a $0.07 of early contract termination expenses. The prior year earnings per share was $3.40, which included a $0.17 reduction, due to a goodwill write-down.","Now looking at the fourth quarter, total company revenue was up 2% on advertising and affiliate fee revenue growth. For expenses in segment profit, the significant item, as Ken mentioned, is the company-wide operational review that we talked to you about in our last call and which we completed in the fourth quarter.","Management took a comprehensive look at the business. We wanted to ensure that we were allocating our resources correctly to maximize our growth and our organization is responsive to the changing nature of the marketplace.","As a result of this review, we\u2019ve reduced our workforce by approximately 5% through a combination of early retirement and position eliminations. We won't see the full impact of this action till the third quarter of 2015. However we expect to start seeing the benefits of a more efficient cost structure immediately.","In the fourth quarter, we recorded restructuring charge of $14 million. We expect to record another $25 million of expense in 2015 under this initiative. As a result of these actions, the business is now better structured to produce and support lifestyle video regardless of platform, device or geography. The company will realize the benefits of these actions for years to come through a lower support cost profile and you see that reflected in our 2015 guidance.","Back to the results. Total reported segment profit was down 4%, reflecting the revenue growth, offset by the restructuring, programming expenses and investments in international, as we continue to grow our global footprint.","Net income attributable to SNI was $0.96, which includes the impact of the restructuring expense. The prior year EPS of $0.73 also included the adjustments related to the goodwill write-down previously noted.","Earnings per share also reflects the benefits of our repurchase of 5.1 million shares of stock in the fourth quarter for $399 million. In the past 12 months, we\u2019ve repurchased 15.4 million shares of stock for $1.2 billion and reduced our fully diluted share count by 7%. We have approximately $450 million remaining under the current repurchase authorization.","With that, let me turn the call over to Lori, and she\u2019ll discuss some of the drivers of these results.","Lori Hickok","Thanks Joe. Looking at key revenue drivers for the fourth quarter, advertising revenue was up less than 1%, while affiliate fee revenue was up 6% versus last year. Advertising revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven by the 2014\/2015 upfront market price increases, partially offset by lower-than-expected scatter pricing and some audience delivery softness at Travel Channel and Food Network during the quarter.","Scatter versus scatter CPM pricing across the network was flat to down low-single-digits year-over-year and up high single-digits to low double-digits over the broadcast upfront. As for advertising categories, our top five were; food, retail, consumer package goods, financial and auto. These are consistent with prior periods.","So far in the first quarter, the advertising market is steady. And as our adverting partners will look out into 2015, their tone is generally positive.","The calendar upfront market also developed for 2015 and the pricing is consistent with what we realized in the broadcast upfront. And cancellations are also running at normal levels.","First quarter year-over-year scatter versus scatter pricing growth is flat to up low-single-digits and the high-single to low-double-digits for the 2014 broadcast upfront. Affiliate fee revenue grew 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by the contractual escalators and the ad slot agreements, Joe previously mentioned for the full-year.","Looking at our network performance in the U.S., revenues were up 2% reflecting the advertising and affiliate fee growth spend noted. Our advertising revenue were up slightly, driven by the pricing and audience delivery softness we discussed. Affiliate fee revenues were up 6% on the items noted.","Cost of services increased 4% due to the timing of show premiers while sales, general and administrative expenses were flat with the prior year. In total, lifestyle median segment expenses were up 2% compared just the prior year, and as a result, total segment profit increased 1% as reported from the prior year period.","Revenues at our international businesses increased 18% to $27 million in the fourth quarter consolidated results, compared with the prior year. Contributing to this growth was our expanded footprint as we\u2019ve launched in more countries over the past years and improved results in the countries that we\u2019ve been operating in.","Our equity and earnings of affiliate was $19 million, consistent with last year. International partnerships in Canada and United Kingdom comprised slightly more than one-half of the equity earnings. The fourth quarter 2014 results were negatively impacted by increased programming expenses at our Canadian partnership and to a lesser extent to foreign exchange rates.","Now looking at our 2015 guidance. First, let me remind you that guidance is based on consolidated results, including international, and excludes any restructuring expenses we expect to incur in the year.","With that, we expect total revenues to increase about 4% in 2015. This reflects expected advertising revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digits, driven by steady advertising market demand and audience deliveries. We expect affiliate fee revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit based on our current distribution agreement escalator and ad slot agreements.","For expenses, focusing on costs of services we\u2019ve anticipated a slowdown in the rate of expense growth as our incremental hours have moderated on our networks. We should again see the impact of that moderation in 2015 and expect cost of services to increase 8% to 10%, down from the low double-digit we\u2019ve experienced in the past several years.","We also expect to realize operational efficiencies from our recent restructuring efforts. Excluding the restructuring expenses, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be down 2% to flat.","Now looking at just the first quarter, the revenues, we expect it will be the lowest percentage growth quarter of the year. We expect revenues to grow in the low single-digits, driven by the current ad environment and audience deliveries.","For expenses driven by the current program premier schedule and associated marketing expenditures, we expect the first quarter to be the highest percentage growth quarter of the year. In total, for expenses we expect high single-digit expense growth in the first quarter.","In the subsequent quarters, we expect the growth rates for revenues to trend up and expenses to follow our normal seasonality pattern. Other items we\u2019ve offered guidance on today are as follows: depreciation and amortization between $100 million and $110 million; interest expense will be approximately $55 million and the effective tax rate between 30% and 32%; non-controlling share of net income between $175 million and $185 million and capital expenditures between $50 million and $60 million.","And with that, we\u2019re ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We\u2019ll take our first question from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Janedis","Thank you. Hi Ken, over the years, I can't think of a time when you\u2019ve underperformed the industry on the advertising side, given your demos and everything you\u2019ve discussed. So in the context of the guidance, are there any assumptions maybe to highlight on the ratings or pricing, or should we interpret this as maybe the broader cable ad market is flat to maybe slightly positive growth this year? Thanks.","Ken Lowe","Sure John. Well, I don't necessarily agree with the statement that we've underperformed. I think depending on performances quarter-to-quarter percentage-wise, we've more than held our own and continue to do so. There is no question that the softer upfront affected the entire industry, and further ratings trends that we were seeing in the industry, I think maybe cause some advertisers to hold back some dollars.","Having said that, we\u2019re slightly encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in this first quarter as far as pick-up, not only in the scatter marketplace, but the 2015 calendar. I spent a little time with Steve Gigliotti last night, and we see some definite positive trends ahead.","The fact that - and Burton outlined it very well, our cable networks in total continued to outperform HGTV really leading the pack. So I think it\u2019s just a little bit of a transition. We've had this in the advertising market over the years from time to time. I don't think, John, there is too much to read into it, but as this mile marker we feel that 2015 overall I think, as Lori indicated, maybe might start a little slower than we all hoped, but we think it\u2019s going to be a year that builds and get stronger through the year.","Very encouraged by some of the things we\u2019re seeing at the Travel Channel, the younger demographics on the Food Network, and again the opportunities that the HGTV is giving us with their stellar ratings. So I think it's just a moment in time. I don't think we should read too much into this or try to start wringing our hands a bit. We\u2019re pretty optimistic","John Janedis","Okay, thanks. And maybe just one on programming. I think your investment in programming has differentiated you from peers. And so within the outlook, are we now at a point were in the 2,500 original hours. Is that going to maybe stable going forward? And maybe more broadly, are you finding it harder or more expensive to launch a success per show versus a year or two ago?","Ken Lowe","I'll let Lori, and Burton may want to chime in as well","Lori Hickok","You're absolutely right. We have reached a level of moderation as we said in the prepared comments. We\u2019re very comfortable with the output of hours that we\u2019re putting on the network. If we increase, it will be because we\u2019re having unbelievable success at travel. That would be the only thing that I would see where we might see an increase on our hours that we\u2019re actually generating and paying for. That would be a good problem to have.","Burton Jablin","Absolutely. And on the price for individual shows. No, there is really no significant change. The shows range in cost per hour, quite frankly depending on where you have to go to do them. If you've got a travel around the world, that's a little more expensive than a show like Fixer Upper, which is produced all in West Texas. So it just varies, but there has been no significant change in that structure.","John Janedis","Okay. Thank you very much.","Ken Lowe","All right, John. Thank you.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll take a question from the line of David Joyce with Evercore ISI.","David Joyce","Thank you. I\u2019d like to get your take on how and when you think the improved Nielsen measurements might phase-in. We think that it will be - the new system would be accredited this summer, and advertisers might start being up on potentially enhanced ratings by the end of the third quarter. But just wondering what your take is on that, and if you've done any back testing with them to see what your ratings may have looked like with the incremental viewing on tablets and that sort of thing? Thank you.","Burton Jablin","Yes, this is Burton. Basically you\u2019ve got it right. You\u2019re reading and hearing the same things we are. We have - our researchers are in constant contact with Nielsen, and in fact served on some of their panels and committees to try to make sure the introduction and measurement systems works for all of us. So we\u2019re looking at all of that. We do have some data about non-linear viewing, and we find it encouraging. Our programming is popular wherever we put it, which is nice to see.","Of course the nicest thing to see is when we have a structure where all of the viewing on all devices will be measured. And we, like everybody else, are hoping to see that happen within the timeframe that you suggested.","David Joyce","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.","Anthony DiClemente","Thanks a lot. I guess, first for whomever would like to take it. I think we had a sense going into this quarter that the fourth quarter that there would be an impact from the soft upfront, but I guess I\u2019m wondering if the weighting of upfront sales throughout the year had an impact here. So for example, if your upfront sales were back-half weighted, is there an element there where you had more volume in the scatter market in the December quarter, and if that percentage weighting changes it could potentially tighten up the market throughout the year. Is that true or not? And then I have a follow-up.","A - Lori Hickok:","No, that is absolutely true. That\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing. And again to Ken\u2019s point, the scatter volumes cost was great. It was just the mix. There wasn\u2019t disproportionate amount of inventory taken out of the fourth quarter with the new upfront. So that's one of the reasons we expect momentum and built throughout the year. We just think that, that will tighten up the market. So you\u2019ve got the same views that we do on that.","Anthony DiClemente","Okay, thanks. And then just a couple of quick ones for Joe, if I may. Just Joe on the guidance that it looks like the minority interest is a little bit lower year-over-year. I\u2019m just wondering why for \u201915? And then secondly on the buyback. Buyback was greater than we had expected. You guys are pretty darn under-levered versus your peers. If you took your leverage ratio up by a turn, I think you could buyback over 10% of the equity market cap. What's holding you back from buying back stock even more aggressively here? Thanks guys.","Joe NeCastro","The minority interest question, I think I\u2019ll have Lori answer it, but on the share buyback pacing, I think that\u2019s something that our Board considers literally every meeting. There is nothing holding us back. We look at the opportunities we\u2019ve got to deploy capital, and this is sort of a time in the year when we review that with, not just with our senior management team but with our Boards to set our priorities for the year going ahead. You did see the activity pick up in the fourth quarter.","I wouldn't read anything positive or negative in that, other than we had some opportunities we thought and we\u2019ll address that quarter-to-quarter with an emphasis in the upcoming quarter.","Lori Hickok","Yes. And on the minority interest, that\u2019s really just a function of where we think the income is coming from and how that works through minority interest with different investments we\u2019re making. And some of that might be more in partnership books as well. So really I would just look at that, that just kind of flows from the other guidance quite honestly.","Anthony DiClemente","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take question from the line of Doug Mitchelson with UBS.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. Two questions. So on the advertising, you talked about the upfront dynamics helping give you confidence in improvements throughout the year. Is there anything else in terms of your ratings delivery or scatter pricing, or volume that you expected? And you mention better tone from advertisers for 2015. Is there any particular ad categories that stand out where you think there is going to be an improvement in flow? And on the buyback side, it\u2019s interesting. You gave interest expense guidance, which seems to reflect your current debt structure and you\u2019ve got some debt that you\u2019re taking out that just about equals your cash. So I\u2019m trying to understand your ability to purchase stock above and beyond your free cash flow generation, given your interest expense guidance. Any help on that would be helpful.","Ken Lowe","Let me take that one first and then I think, Lori, will take the second part - or the first part of your question. No, there is nothing holding us back. There are no artificial barriers. This is something, as I mentioned to you, that the Board considers given the broader picture. I\u2019m not going to front-run the board on our view for the upcoming year, but if there is news to share on that front, we certainly will. But no, there is no barrier. There are no reasons that we couldn't take that up and actually increase leverage, but that's obviously an important Board level decision.","Doug Mitchelson","But if you pursued that, then your interest guidance would likely change, right, because interest guidance doesn't seem to...","Ken Lowe","Right.","Doug Mitchelson","Okay.","Ken Lowe","Right. For the purpose of providing guidance, we make sort of a steady state assumption.","Doug Mitchelson","Understood.","Lori Hickok","And regarding interest among advertisers. First, I would say we always have strong demand regardless of what's going on in the broader economy back to just the quality brands, the audience and all of that. But Steve, we discussed some comments from him. He has been at Builders\u2019 Show. He seems strong demand from like the home improvement area, very bullish on the auto industry where there is a lot of new models coming out. He sees strength all over the place, and we go out to these different tradeshows and all he is got is positive. We really are seeing back to that strength in building throughout the year. The tone is positive, no matter who we\u2019re talking to. We are just - we\u2019re seeing positive signs.","Ken Lowe","And Doug, this is Ken. Let me just add in. I was at the Builders\u2019 Show with Steve as well, and I can underscore the same thing. But I think what we are seeing and I don't think to say a general broad statement, but what we\u2019re seeing too is in some cases some of the dollars that we felt might be moving to digital when we had a soft or upfront.","We\u2019re actually seeing now deals being cut back that involve digital pieces of our business. So it gives us some more encouragement that some of those dollars that was question mark, are they moving from linear advertising to digital. I think again as I mentioned earlier, I think we\u2019re in somewhat of transition period here, a little bit of a biomarker as to how we\u2019re doing business, but the encouraging thing is TV still works, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing back from advertisers. When they need to move the needle at the cash register, our brands are still extremely valuable.","So we think that \u201815 is going to be just fine. And as we said, we think it\u2019s going to build. And so I think that - and again not a general broad statement, but we are seeing some encouraging signs on some of the digital front.","Doug Mitchelson","All right. Thank you very much.","Ken Lowe","Sure Doug.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric Handler","Yes, thanks for taking my question. I wondered if you could talk a little about the corporate express line a little bit in your - in the segment EBITDA line. Corporate expenses increased quite a bit from \u201814 to \u201813. Maybe you could break into the buckets, show us how much is corporate overhead, what's international and other items, so we could sort of look at the directional view of each of those buckets?","Lori Hickok","Well, I\u2019ll just probably provide some quick commentary before we hand to the buckets, so what\u2019s really driving most of the year-over-year variance are couple of things is our investment in international. And that included the Chello deal that we talked about a couple of quarters ago, as well as the restructuring for some restructuring cost sit there, but if you look and strip out our investments and you\u2019ve also got [indiscernible].","So when we strip that, out corporate actually based on the cost controls we\u2019ve put in place in the year before, that had moderated with actually down year-over-year. So really what we\u2019re seeing is organic investments and really international without breaking in just specific buckets.","Eric Handler","Okay. And international I\u2019m assuming is still loss?","Lori Hickok","That would be true, yes.","Eric Handler","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go to line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank","Thanks very much. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the assumptions that are embedded in guidance for domestic distribution. You guys call that Dish, congratulations on sort of making the cut for the light bundle. Can you talk about how that Dish deal factors into revenue guidance? Is it sort of take-or-pay for what kind of level additive versus substituted? I guess also generally, when we look at distribution for the domestic business and you kind of look at the latest data we have available from the September Q until the 10-K comes out, unless you want to give us a little preview of it, domestic distribution for the three biggest channels in September was down like 3% to 4% year-over-year. And so I\u2019m kind of wondering, what\u2019s driving that trend, and is there a reversal of that embedded into next year's guidance? Thank you.","Lori Hickok","I'll start with your later question first. And we do have some modest deterioration in the sub-base baked in. Again, nothing significant. We didn\u2019t see the trend change in the fourth quarter. Pretty much what we've seen for the last probably year, year and a half continues. We do see switching between telcos and satellite and cable companies, and that continues to shift around, but we don't see any reason why that would change. It probably will stabilize over time. That's one of the reasons we did do the Dish deal. There is other ways to get subscribers, getting our content in all places that they might purchase it.","As far as its impacts on our guidance, I would say it would be minimal. It's a new product that we\u2019re putting out there. We\u2019re watching that. We\u2019re hopeful. But we have to wait and see what the take rate actually looks like in there, but our hope is that we will attract some millennials along with Dish that will watch our products and we can sell to advertisers in the future.","David Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now to go to Amy Yong with Macquarie.","Amy Yong","Thanks. My question is actually around Travel Channel and COGS. Can you just elaborate on some of the progress that you\u2019re making there, and what kind of appetite do you have to buy in the remainder of Travel Channel? Thanks.","Burton Jablin","Well, I\u2019ll take the progress question and interpret that as a question about progress on ratings Amy. So, we feel good about what\u2019s going on there. As we\u2019ve said, there are about 20 new series that are being introduced through the course of this year. Two have already gone on the air. I mentioned them earlier, but I\u2019ll give you another bit of fact about Booze Traveler.","It actually was the most upscale program, new series to be introduced on Travel Channel since 2008. And Expedition Unknown was the highest rated new series to be introduced in the last three years. So we\u2019re off to a good start. Those are two of 20. Now not everyone will be extraordinary and that\u2019s the way things work.","But we feel good about those, because they really are right on target for the consistent environment that we\u2019re trying to build, which shows that truly are valid exploring people places and cultures around the world. So it\u2019s off to a good start on that and much more to come. We\u2019ve got a couple of series premiering at March; Breaking Borders, Hotel Amazon. We have a lot of faith in those, and just kind of a fun thing for all of us who are [indiscernible] each week coming up next week. So just a little break from winter.","And on the COGS part, I\u2019ll turn that over to Joe.","Joe NeCastro","Amy, happy to address that. Look, we believe over time the value in Travel Channel is going to continue to grow. So obviously we are encouraged and interested in buying it back in. Later this year, we will reach a point in our agreement where we have the option to buy it in. And it\u2019s our intention to do so at this time. It will depend on price obviously, but we believe that it\u2019s something that will grow over time and therefore makes more sense to buy it, sooner rather than later.","As a corollary to that, though just so you know, we don\u2019t do that as having any material effect in any way on the rest of our capital allocation decisions with respect to returning capital to shareholders.","Amy Yong","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Let me go back to the bigger topic of sort of a changing environment you operate in. And I think one of the undeniable consumer trends. I think you\u2019d agree as undeniable is more and more migration to on-demand viewing, which takes place in all sorts of different ways and formats. There is a prevalent view I think in the investment community that, that trend to on-demand viewing is bad for non-fiction branded networks. The one big exception to that from its marketplace data is the Scripps Networks. So I would love your thoughts on what is it about your brand, your networks, your audiences that make you so much different than the way the data looks for other companies in this space? Thanks.","Burton Jablin","Todd, this is Burton. Thanks for that question. We do think and talk about that a lot. In fact, I was with our ad sales leadership last week where we went over each of our networks in detail and this was a big topic of discussion. We are seeing increase the on-demand viewing.","I would say the way we would explain are doing well in that environment is that the audience that we track, the upscale, educated, highly desirable audience advertisers, is an audience that really doesn\u2019t watch too much else across the television isle. And so our interpretation of it is that they love what we do and they can't get enough of it. And so if there is an offering of our content that allows them to customize their experience, they\u2019ll do it.","We see it in on-demand - just video-on-demand, that standard video-on-demand. We\u2019re seeing it with our programming on Netflix. We actually see it and download to own, where people are paying money to download and watch individual episodes of our shows. And I will say this is one of the reasons that we\u2019re very gung-ho about TV Everywhere. It just expands the opportunity for our viewers and additional viewers, but certainly the ones that are most dedicated to our networks to get even more of them.","And I\u2019m excited to say that in addition to the TV Everywhere apps and the sites that our distributors have, which in many cases have not just on-demand content but are live feed, we\u2019ll be launching live feeds of our networks on our own apps and websites coming up in the middle of this year. Once we do that, we\u2019re going to put a nice marketing campaign behind it and we think we\u2019ll be able to drive even more viewing of the live networks through mobile devices but also more than on-demand viewing as you rightly pointed out. So we\u2019re very pleased with that phenomenon.","Ken Lowe","Yes, Todd, this is Ken. If I could just, couldn\u2019t said it better that Burton did, but one other thing I just want to tag onto. Another thing we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019ve seen for quite a while is on-demand for our content, especially while we\u2019re either at rolling or embedded advertising, actually has a much higher percentage of the advertising being watched and the term we\u2019d like to use is engaged.","So I think if you look at the long-term trends to your point, the changing environment, we\u2019re just looking at our content moving for one platform, which by the way just does very well. We have 92% live viewing across our networks to a demand platform, or in some cases, we maybe could have enhanced advertiser viewing which could be against the grain and the against the trend of the industry in general.","Todd Juenger","Thank is really helpful. Thank you guys for your thoughts.","Operator","Now we\u2019ll go to line of Mike Morris with Guggenheim.","Mike Morris","Thank you. Good morning guys. Two questions. First on Sling. I\u2019m curious a little more about the relationship terms there. Is this - the length of time that you are on Sling, is it similar to what you see in a traditional distribution agreement? And whose decision is it going forward, whether you continue to be on the service in the future or not? And also is there a limit to the number of subscribers - from your side, is there a limit to the number of subscribers that cannot take the service? And then secondly, you referenced the calendar upfront. The volume in the calendar upfront this year the relationship for the broadcast upfront, what does that indicate? Was it the same as usual, or was it lower this year, and what do you think that means about the mix of upfront inventory versus scatter inventory going forward? Thanks.","Burton Jablin","This is Burton. I\u2019ll try answering the Sling question and then turn the second question over to Lori. The deal with Sling which as known as one of these virtual MVPDs is just like another distribution deal. So our networks are carried on it for the length of the term, and that works just the same as any other distribution deal with the traditional MVPD.","And in terms of where it can go, I guess that depends on how well Dish markets it and what the audience is. So we, like everyone else, will just have to wait and see.","Lori Hickok","And regarding the calendar upfront, it was actually up over prior-year level. That's again why we\u2019re looking optimistic about the advertising market the tone again. Took a little bit out of the broadcast upfront being experienced in the calendar and again the options are low. So again all of this good signs.","Mike Morris","So as you look into this year's broadcast upfront process, you don't see anything right now that would lead you to believe that there\u2019d be less interest on the buying side and kind of the commitment side in advance versus just holding back for the scatter market?","Lori Hickok","It's a little too early probably to call that, but there is nothing that we see that would say that it\u2019s going to be a dampened market at this point. So it\u2019s really too early to comment [indiscernible] that we\u2019re seeing again are positive indicators. And we\u2019re not seeing anything that would make us think that we would be further hold back on the upfront this year.","Mike Morris","Great. Thank you.","Operator: We\u2019ll now go to line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a couple of questions. Just a point of clarification on the guidance. Lori, on the cost side. I just want to make sure it\u2019s accurate. We should be including the restructuring in the fourth quarter in the cost base, and then excluding the $25 million restructuring in \u201815 when we think about the guidance you guys gave on growth and cost. Is that accurate?","Lori Hickok","Let me repeat to make sure I understand your question. When you look at the numbers for the fourth quarter, it includes the restructuring fee. You would have to back it out and if you would, you would see that our expenses and our segment profit was more in line with revenues. So its $40 million in costs related to restructuring in the fourth quarter of 2014. In the 2015 guidance, we excluded that. So there will be an additional about $25 million that Joe referenced in the prepared remarks on top of that guidance we provided. And that\u2019s predominantly in the first three quarters. It\u2019s pretty evenly dispersed to be honest. And then it really falls off in the fourth quarter. So we\u2019ll see some of that really hitting all the quarters next years, but weighted towards the first.","Ben Swinburne","Okay, so the base dollar amount that the SG&A guidance is off of excludes the $14 million restructuring?","Lori Hickok","That\u2019s your question.","Ben Swinburne","Yes.","Lori Hickok","No.","Ben Swinburne","Okay. So it includes it. Got it. Okay, that's what I thought - that's how I totally asked the question. Sorry about that.","Lori Hickok","Okay.","Ben Swinburne","And then secondly, maybe you guys have expressed encouraging tone about advertisers looking out this year. And obviously the other piece of the puzzle is ratings. You guys have generally outperformed for years your cable network competitors in ratings. I think part of that has been your increase in investment and in hours. And I know you talked about the fact, you think you're at the right place on hours. Can you talk about why you think that, and if you're seeing some stabilization in sort of what's been happening with repeats? So I think the general view in the market right or wrong is that the big ratings pressure is in repeat programming. So increasing your hours is sort of critical and it sounds like maybe you\u2019ve reached a point where you feel like you\u2019ve addressed that or maybe trends have changed? Any color on inside the ratings mix would be helpful for us.","Burton Jablin","Yes, Ben, this is Burton. So it really does depend on the network. We do believe we\u2019ve reached sort of a steady state on the number of networks. I think HGTV is a shining example of that. We've been at roughly the same level of programming hours at HGTV for quite some time. When it comes to repeat, it really does depend on the program, but I will tell you that we\u2019re really not seeing any major unusual change in [indiscernible] versus original episodes or premiere episodes. It's sort of the same as it always is. It depends on the show. So, just as an example, if you've got a serialized contest type show, like Worst Cooks, that will tend to repeat not as well as a show like Fixer Upper, where people can sort of watch it over and over and see new things in it every time.","And there isn't a storyline that if you sort of seen it, you know the story. That's kind of obvious I know, but it is the way it plays out. But otherwise repeats kind of work pretty well. House Hunters, which has been on for, I believe it's 18 years now, still going strong. We have a lot of original episodes, but the repeats do really, really well.","And on travel, that is still, as Lori referenced earlier, we\u2019re still building there. And my guess is we have not reached the steady state for a number of hours of shows there. It's one where we really hope as Lori said, we find shows that we want to make many, many more episodes of and I think we will among the 20 new series that are being introduced.","So no dramatic changes in the repeat factor, and we are getting to a place where we feel relatively stable on the programming hours, but we tell all of our programming teams, if you find us something that we want to make many, many more of because the ratings are good, that's where we want to spend our money.","Ben Swinburne","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Ken Lowe","Thanks Ben.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. I have a question on the upcoming cable upfronts, not the strength. I think that's been discussed. But more of the, I guess how you might position yourself strategically differently this time around. Do you think it'll be a different process in the sense that do you think, given some of the shares shifting and Ken given your earlier comments about seeing some of those dollars reappear on your digital platforms, do you think it's going to be, I guess a different approach where you\u2019re going there with a much more of a bundled package digital and linear TV, or not that different from the past years?","Burton Jablin","Alexia, this is Burton. And that's a really good question too, because as I said, I was with our ad sales team last week and the upfront is very much on our mind. No dramatic shift, but that's partly because we've always sold our networks and digital services together. And we talk about the strength of our brands, strength of our content both, on-air and online. And we really do try to do as much convergence selling as we can. We\u2019d like to do more obviously, but our teams on the programming side, on the digital side work together to create convergent content. You can find more and more of it on our websites and apps as time goes on, and we do try to sell those together.","So no dramatic change. We've been pretty successful in driving, sort of, holistic packages when we can. We have created a position on our ad sales team that really is designed to help us drive more cross-network and cross-platform deals. He just started in that position, somebody who is been with our company for quite some time, John Dailey. But he's having some nice success in going out and making the case that collectively the whole of our networks and sites and digital offerings is greater than some of the parts. So we\u2019ll continue to make that case and it seems to do very well with our advertising partners.","Alexia Quadrani","And then just a quick follow-up, if I can, on your comments earlier about the fourth quarter and the different protocols. Consumer package goods, we\u2019ve heard us in one of the weaker categories. Was that part of the problem in the December quarter, and I guess, if so, any change so far this year?","Lori Hickok","No, I mean I think it was really back to the things we've talked about, as far as there was a heavier scatter market we saw great demand, but it was really just that disproportionate amount of upfront coming out. We did see it - we saw similar trends that the industry did, but again, the good thing about being Scripps Networks Interactive is advertisers still want to advertise on our networks regardless of what's going on in the broader economy and what\u2019s going on in their shops individually. So that was not part of what we were seeing in fourth quarter","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you.","Ken Lowe","Thanks Alexia.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take questions from line of Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee.","Vasily Karasyov","Thank you, good morning. My question is on advertising too. Historically you have a bigger proportion of your annual non-city and base revenues like sponsorship and so on in the first half of the year. And I was wondering if you could give us some idea about how the growth rates in debt bucket correlates with the scatter market and the upfront. So does that - is it directly correlated? So if your scatters is solves, that means that the sponsorship also has pricing pressure? So thank you.","Lori Hickok","I would say no. Sponsorship is just a different thing that we sell. That's like a balance whistle [ph] something that the ad sales team sells as part of a package. It's probably more driven by seasonality and different events that we have, if you're talking about sponsorship. So no, and I don't know if Burton you have anything to add on that?","Burton Jablin","No, I would just Dream Home is in the first quarter of the year on HGTV and that\u2019s by far the biggest sponsored package that we offer and has the most advertisers so that may affect the way you\u2019ve raised your question I\u2019m guessing.","Vasily Karasyov","Right. And the revenue growth in that sponsorship, that's not as is - that isn't softening in anyway shear performance right now?","Burton Jablin","Tremendous demand for Dream Home.","Vasily Karasyov","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take questions now from line of Ben Mogil with Stifel","Ben Mogil","Hi guys. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Now that you\u2019re on Netflix as well, kind of curious if they are giving you or ad slots getting feedback around programming that you\u2019re now incorporating into the new shell ideas and corporate it into existing series. Sort of curious if you\u2019re able to use even any kind of general ratings framework or commentary that gives you in terms of some programming thoughts going forward on the linear service?","Burton Jablin","This is Burton. We have some information. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s enough right now. We\u2019ve only been on there for four months to make any significant conclusions about it. We\u2019re happy in there too with the viewing of our programs. But as far as any further conclusions from that, that\u2019s kind of hard to do right now on limited data.","Ben Mogil","Do you think say, when you and I talk in year and you\u2019ve got 16, 17 runs behind you that there will be enough that you will sort of will be able to say that this is working or we\u2019re just going to keep doing things as we are doing, whether you have enough of a timeframe and a data set to work with something?","Joe NeCastro","We\u2019ll have more data on what conclusions will drive, it\u2019s hard to say. My guesses we\u2019ll learn a lot about - lot more about how our programming impacts in an non-demand environment. And that would be good.","Ben Mogil","Are the cable and satellite operators giving you sort of similar data on the VOD viewings, so again you can sort of go back and see what\u2019s really popular and think about formulations that way?","Burton Jablin","We get VOD data for sure, and we use that to inform the content that we\u2019re putting there beyond what we\u2019re contractually required to do, yes.","Ben Mogil","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks a lot for the color.","Burton Jablin","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Mr. Nathanson is your life muted?","Michael Nathanson","Yes. Can you guys hear me? Thanks. I have one for Ken, Burton. Then one for Lori and Joe. Now we\u2019re starting a new calendar year, can you guys give me a refresher on the percentage of affiliate? Your affiliate total that comes due over the next three years and is there any one year over the next three that's more heavily weighted on a number of deals that come due?","Burton Jablin","No. Not really,","Ken Lowe","Not really Michael.","Michael Nathanson","And what percentage of the footprint comes due in the next three years?","Lori Hickok","I think there is several. I mean we\u2019ve got a big chunk coming through, so I think we\u2019re going to be quite busy over the next three years, but it\u2019s pretty evenly spread throughout that period.","Ken Lowe","No one time.","Lori Hickok","There is no one-time big event, I guess I should say.","Q - Michael Nathanson:","Okay. But as percentage, is it more than halved to your base?","Lori Hickok","That\u2019s probably fair, but I don\u2019t - that\u2019s probably a fair assumption. Probably little more.","Q - Michael Nathanson: Okay. And then, Lori, to you on the cash flow statement. If you look at the relationship between the cash spending on programming, and the amortization of that programming. It\u2019s about $100 million gap right now. How do you see that directionally change in the next couple of years? Those gap close as you amortize more, so cash spending or does that gap rise or still the same?","Lori Hickok","We expect it to moderate and actually close. A little bit to our point where we think the hours are comfortable. So what you're seeing is maybe the mix changing or price sensitivity. And again if we keep building travel then you might see it, but we expect that gap to close.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. Thanks.","Ken Lowe","All right, Nick, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from the line of Laura Martin with Needham.","Laura Martin","Hi there. I\u2019m actually interested in your point of view about $3 billion disappeared from the TV ecosystem on the advertising side in the second half of last year. And I cover all of the platforms that do premium video and the biggest increase was AOL, they did a total of $400 million total in the entire year. So my question is - and you guys are pretty optimistic, it sounds like of a cyclical rebound in \u201915. So I\u2019m really interested in where you think that money went since it\u2019s not showing up on digital platforms and you guys think it's coming back. So I\u2019m really interested in that and then I have a follow-up.","Ken Lowe","Yes, Laura, you actually with all the analysis you do probably have a better answer than I do. I'll tell you, I think some of it wasn't actually put on the table. It went back into the budgets or \u201cit just wasn't spent\u201d. I don't think in some cases some of the dollars that we\u2019ve seen and some of the agencies and advertisers and clients we deal it, it was hold back, it was can we get a better deal, can we take a little look at programmatic, can we move some money here.","Again, I think I'll just be redundant and say what I\u2019ve said earlier, Laura, despite this transition that we certainly are going through, with a lot of different levers to pull, I\u2019m more bullish about our content and our brands going forward. So I can only speak to how we feel that the information we\u2019re getting back from our advertisers, our agencies and our clients.","Remember, we\u2019re a little unique in that we work closely with clients for 20 years now, because we've developed packages whether it\u2019s Dream Home, whatever it might be. That works well in our categories and is continued to work well. So I'll continue to read your reports to find out where the money went, but\u2026","Laura Martin","I\u2019m looking forward Ken.","Ken Lowe","If anybody can find that Laura, it will be you.","Laura Martin","Snapchat, I\u2019m really interested in. So did they approach you? Are you getting approached by a lot of other digital platforms that are sort of adjacent to Snapchat? And what\u2019s the economic model there, Ken. Is it a red share, is it just promotion from your point of view. I\u2019m interested in how as we move to linear content onto these digital platforms, how that opens up new consumer markets but also new economics pools of money?","Ken Lowe","Yes, look, it\u2019s a very good question. Burton has really worked closely with his team on this. I\u2019ll let him take.","Burton Jablin","Yes, Laura, so basically our teams are having conversations with basically everybody. There is great interest in our lifestyle content all across the board. And Snapchat was one that we dealt with a good opportunity to test the network content. We have an audience that is something of the new audience for us, millennials, so then we do get younger viewers on Food Network for sure.","And yes, there is advertising attached to it. We have great interest among advertisers who experiment with us. In some cases, very short form advertising just like a short form video or other FLAC content. And as far as revenue goes, it sort of all the depends on the deals. Sometimes these revenues is there and sometimes there is not. It varies - it will vary, I would have to say in each of the deals will do like this assuming we do more. But it really is a test for us, and for Snapchat obviously, so far so good.","Ken Lowe","Okay. Well, thanks everybody. Mike and I will be available for follow-ups today.
